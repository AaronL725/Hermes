OK I'm a forex newbie, so apologies if this "system" appears elsewhere on this site. I use only Bollinger Bands (not essential - but useful) and mark one eyeball! System should work on any time frame and any pair (after all the only real differences between short and long timeframes is scale!) Basically I look for blindingly obvious changes in direction of the price movement (see attached pic). Remember the reversal will be OBVIOUS A good signal will be at the extreme edge of a bollinger bad, and will consist of a classic candlestick reversal pattern (just research candlestick reversal patterns) depending on how much play you want in the move, then your stop loss will be just below the lowest/highest point just prior to the large candle. Typically a total stop loss of 15-25 pips on the 1 min timeframe (eur/usd) should be sufficient - but of course will depend on the size of the reversal candle. Take profit will vary, but as a rule, if you look for 10 pips on a 1 min timeframe, you wont go far wrong. Using this method, you should be able to get 10-20 trades a day, at an average of 10 pips 200 pips should be relatively easy to achieve! I'm sure there are hundreds of indicators that could be added to improve the system - but the whole point is K.I.S.S.! If I have made any glaring errors - please feel free to let me know - and Good trading!!! The other indicator (200sma) newmacd are simply there as a guide - 200sma is useful

hi thanks for sharing.. is there any chance you could post a few more examples on a clearer chart.. Danny. The wise man knows what he doesn't know..

--- 帖子 #3 ---
my demo MT4 is down for now, but will upload ASAP

OK have attached 1 min chart of eur/jpy circling potential trades (in my eyes at least) As I said in my original post. Trades will be Obvious. If you cannot see it just by scanning, it isn't there!!! As you can see from this, there are 7 trades in 3 hours, and could have easily achieved over 100 pips on just one currency!)

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks for the second chart much clearer,

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Using the range then trading a reversal to get some of the follow through isn't bad. Added this into my own trading sytem, more hopefully profitable setups per day Thanks

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Just noticed something on the 1min eur/jpy that caught my eye! Attached at the point I noticed, than 3 mins later. As I said - the trades will be OBVIOUS. I have added the 3rd screenshot to illustrate where I would have been out on this trade. I look for modest pips, and there was a sign of weakness on this particular trade. Sure it could have and indeed may well go on to make more, however a 10-20 pip target on each trade, and I can re-enter when strength returns to the move. I have exposed my account to for a sum total of 5 minutes, with a gain of 20 pips! Also please notice that my SL would have been 131.5 (so the risk/reward ratio was 2:1). 131.5 just happens to be a "round" number so is a prime candidate in itself on systems based on round numbers!! 5-10 of those a day is BIG money

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Just to prove my point...... I hope people find this useful!!!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
OK hopefully I have described the "system" well enough for you to see what I am trying to say. These trades will stick out like sore thumbs. If I can see them ANYONE can !!! There are a whole lot of so-called K.I.S.S systems posted here - is there one that is simpler??? Remember indicators are NOT needed for this!!! This works ANY PAIR aND ANY TIMEFRAME So PLEASE, if you see an OBVIOUS trade place it on this thread!!! I look forward to what you find!!! IF IN DOUBT KEEP OUT!!!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Most of my system is based on a 3EMA crossing over a 5SMA, then confirming it's direction by taking out 13sma then 26sma pausing at either ='s exit sharpish before it reverses on you. Much like yours you need to trade it after another move to catch the reverse. 3ema filters out spikes and noise nicely.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Great, could you post a screenshot of your system in action here please? I'm sure your system could well be better than mine profit wise, but my method does not rely on any indicators. I'm not for one moment saying that mine is the most effective (it might be - but only time will tell!) But I think I have a strong case for saying it is the most efficient!! Always willing to learn from someone more experienced than I

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi. Thank you for sharing and Good Trading for you too. You have probably made a error when calculating your numbers. You say "200 pips should be relatively easy to achieve" but you also say "you should be able to get 10-20 trades a day" and "look for 10 pips on a 1 min timeframe" That will be more like around 150 pips pr day in average if you have 100% hitrate. And you say "Typically a total stop loss of 15-25 pips" so if you have a couple of loosers or more pr day (and i guess you have far more than 2 loosers pr day if you have 15 trades or what? Maybe 4 - 5 loosers?) you are down to maybe average around 100 pips pr day and that is even probably even far to optimistic number i guess? So the way i read it i think there have to be some big errors in your numbers. So what is your average hitrate and how many pips do you normally make on average pr day with this system? Thank you very much in advance. Regards. Arctic4x

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Will post 1 up later when I'm on the PC and outta bed!! Artic4x, he's taking the same trades as I look for in 1 of my setups, slightly different way to spot it, I got 23wins in a row just playing that recently without any even going negative, jumping on when momentum is high and not getting greedy is key. The downside is, alot of watching required and waiting for only a few minutes in the market so you'll get bored and start making stupid trades again

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Turveyd look forward to your charts.. Danny. The wise man knows, what he doesn't know..!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Arctic, I see where you are coming from, what I meant is 10 - 20 wins OVERALL at 10 - 20 pips each would be 100-200 pips (so if you have 5 losses then you will need 20-30 trades to get your 10-20 - as you will have lost 5 so need another 5 to make that up - my maths is NOT that bad!!!) That CANNOT be contested!! with this system, you should be able to achieve 10 wins OVERALL in any one day. Also, you should know relatively quickly in the trade if it is going for you or against you, so you don't have to wait for the SL to be hit. Nothing worse than spotting a trade going against you, and watching it go right the way to your SL, when you spotted it 5-10 pips before! As I said IF IN DOUBT STAY OUT By watching the price movements in a very short time it will be OBVIOUS which trades are likely to succeed and which aren't TurveyD, Thanks for your input - clearly I must be on the right lines at lkeast!!! I too look forward to your charts. I never claim for this method to be perfect, but ultimately any method that can win more times than it loses should be able to be profitable. The whole point of this is that if it is OBVIOUSLY going in a direction go for it. Thus if you are OBVIOUSLY wrong then get out ASAP, then move on to the next one. In the brief time I have been using this, there are at least 2-3 trades per hour per currency. With no indicators, it is very easy to check 5 currencies and literally within seconds spot potential trends. I showed this to my 12 year old son on an MT4 demo account and within the first hour he made 3 successful trades!!!

Well it certainly 1 of the quicker easier ways to make a living of Forex, small but relatively often and safe. I've included my chart template for EJ, which this system works better on as it has much bigger pip swings. Bailing the first sign of trouble is important, a) it preserves cash and b) with this setup it very likely it'll be a fake up move and reverse on you hard and fast as your normally counter trend. Avoid trading over news, although when right it'll be highly profitable so maybe it's a good time to trade and a guaranteed move to jump on, but it's also erratic and will hit your stop too quickly to do anything. As said, very similar methodology 23wins in a row. All SMA lines are used as S/R areas, which you can use as reverse points and trend indication!! Have fun

--- 帖子 #17 ---
TurveyD Just downloaded your template on MT4, and the amount of EMAs on there is confusing me to the extreme!!! Perhaps you could put a screenshot with the key points highlighted (i.e. where exactly your entries and exits would be. I presume you would use the crossing of either the thick yellow or white lines and the blue lines - or is there something I am missing here?!! I'm sure it is highly effective, but definitely takes more to process (at least in my mind!!) Thanks for all your efforts

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi psgm, Thanks for sharing your system. I realy want to lay my hand on something simple.I will study this very well so do not hesitate to teach more and post more of the chart.Can u pls post a template. Real pips.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
whats ur BB set up?? if somebody hasnt asked??

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I have to disagree on one point. The obviousness of the trade afterward does not means that the trade is obvious at the moment. You need to explain more clearly your point because i'm sorry to say that i'm a bit confused. You have circled areas when there is an acceleration but if firmly believe you are prone to a big number of losses with this strategy. For example, on this trade http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...6&amp;d=1241162537 , it could absolutely have turned into a double top. You have no way to tell that there will be a continuation. Also scalping (because you are scalping) is the more stressfull strategy that exists so maybe it's rewarding but you need a lot of time, a lot of concentration and month of screen time before starting to trade.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi all, Glad this thread seems to be of use to some people! With regards to hindsight trades - if you pay close attention to example 3, 4 and 5, they were taken from LIVE TRADE screenshots! pic 3 was the point where I would have entered the trade. Pic 4 was confirmation, and pic 5 was where I would have exited. My stop loss would have been 5-10 pips below the last candle showing of the graph. The final pic shows that there was 10-15 pip profit on that particular trade. You are absolutely right that a double top COULD have formed, but this are SHORT TERMS trades. If the price had gone the wrong way, then I would have been out very early. I chose that candle because it was a doji on a bollinger band (and I have seen this turn into a reversal quite a few times). Again, like any system this is not perfect, but just by scanning a chart you can see where to expect the moves. I've added another chart to show potential trades as they happened, and also indicating the stop loss As for a template, not sure I can give a template with no indicators!!!! The bollinger band is the standard default (it is there as a guide - NOT ESSENTIAL)! The only way I can suggest to test this method is simply open ANY chart on a 1min (so you can see this happen in a short timeframe) and using just the default bollinger band, spot a turn occur - trust me they ARE obvious? If they aren't obvious they aren't trades!! Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #22 ---
That down spike and a up turn in 1 min was likely stop hitting, at the moment the market is doing that, give it a few weeks and what looks like a stop hit will follow through to trap the people trading off that, then they'll flip it again Yep, my systems got A LOT of lines, I keep trying to simplify it but they I miss trades so getting my self used to them, the thicker the higher the odds of a turn though your likely better off just putting a 3ema ( use as the price ), 5sma and 13sma on your chart, when you think your current systems got a signal AND the 3ema crosses over the 5sma trade it, exit when the 3 passes back under the 5.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
One main question : do you trade it live ? In your different posts you use the word "would"... For me this is dream trading. Not trading. I trade live with a simple 50SMA + fractal strategy and when i say live, it is live. I do not put potential trade (or just to show that i missed them) but real live trade where money is/was on the balance.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I trade very similar setups Live with great success different indicator setup but same market, 23 wins 0 losses with that setup. Find something small and repeatable, focus on it and perfect it. Trust me trying to beat the entire market and take every setup is wayyy more trouble than it's worth

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Fair enough Melpheos - clearly you are having difficulty with me for some reason over this system. Clearly it is not for you and I wish you well in your trading. As for "dream trading", today I didn't trade no - I was trying to pass on my thoughts to others if it would help them! I have traded this live - it has worked for me. I raised it to highlight the fact that indicators are not VITAL to a trading strategy. K.I.S.S - the clue is in the title!!! There are thousands of strategies that use lots and lots of indicators. This is for people who want to look for opportunities with the minimum of information. As far as I can tell my strategy is similar to TurveyD - but I have arrived there at a different angle - there is always a different way of doing things.!!! I'm not saying I'm going to be 100% profitable, but I only trade when I think an obvious change in direction has occured! If it doesn't suit your trading style fine good luck to you - this method suits me

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Never found a indicator which means anything to me and I've studied them all, is this me or are they really just wastes of time and your better off looking at the price chart. My SMA's work uncanningly well though and so do BB's but thats it literally.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
OK people, Not bad for a first day of a thread!! Lot of helpful comments. Just an update on the last attachment I posted - I stated 2 potential trades and Turveyd rightly pointed out that the second could have been a retracement. Not only do I agree with him on that, but it did indeed turn! I could argue that my first potential trade was the one I was focussing on and the second was the end (which was the trade I spotted first), but hey as I said in my very first sentence I'm a newbie - and I am not prefect!!! What I will say is, I did NOT enter this trade live (I never enter near the end of a trading session), but also I would have only lost about 5-10 pips, as my stop loss for the second trade would have been just below the "large" candle. Also would be great if others could load up potential trades based on my idea. Would really like to see if people have the same idea as me as to what an OBVIOUS change looks like!! For those brave souls all I ask is this..... 1) Try no to use indicators (I'm using a bollinger band as a guide not as a key component) 2) Any potential trade must be an OBVIOUS change in direction - you should be able to track it INSTANTLY As I said before I tried this with my 12 year old son - he spotted 4 on his first attempt!! THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!! Finally turveyd (sorry for singling you out here!) the template with the numerous smas/emas do you have a tutorial?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Did I ??? I don't remember that which is a bit worrying, middle age hey!! No sorry, just treat the SMA's are S/R points scroll back on the chart and study see if it means anything to you. USE This Indicator to ( it's not ) it just draws lines at every 50 and 00, the 00's are good reversal points helps me if I can see them easily and it also puts a bigger brighter line for the Bid ( my own change ) so thats easier to see.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
OK, Just to try and clarify what I mean by OBVIOUS, I have attached a screenshot with what I consider OBVIOUS moves. As you can see not all of them are particularly large moves (after all this is a screenshot of 9.30 BST on a UK Bank holiday Monday!), however depending on the spread of your broker there are some nice little profits to be made. The yellow arrows point to where I think there is an obvious move. As you can see, there are multiple entries on the larger moves. Depending on your risk appetite, and size of stop losses, you could easily have caught the majority of the larger moves available, I am merely pointing out POTENTIAL opportunities if the initial entry point was missed. By the way the emas are as suggested by turveyd 5,13 and the Bolinger band is default - these were NOT used to determine the signals!!!

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Chart looks like it's got 3EMA and 5SMA, I prefer the mechanical ness of this cross on your chart personally, as said I use it with the Candles virtually invisible to hide the randomness which is just noise I don't want. But everyone has different ways of seeing the same thing, so whats obvious to you likely isn't to someone else. If it works for you, REPEAT endlessly until rich

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Turveyd, just quickly "Backtesting" - i.e scanning through old charts!! using 3ema, 5sma as you suggested, and there is no doubt you are going to pick up lots of pips! Therefore, my system will possibly pick up slightly less opportunitys then yours, however as I said I am a relative newbie, and there can always more than one way to boil an egg! Hopefully my thread proves useful to somebody, if nothing else it has proven to me that at the very least I am on the right lines!! Happy trading everyone!!!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
But my system suffers during chop ( on it's own, I obviously don't use it on it's own ) but if you combine that simple cross with your system then it picks less trades but also picks less wrong trades. 1000's of ways to make money, just find the 1 that reports for you and REPEAT!!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Good point! no system is 100% prefect!!!! 8-) If it were, I could sell it for a fortune!!! Just one thing people, I've been saying look for OBVIOUS trades. Could someone else out there please either agree or disagree that the signals I have highlighted could be considered Obvious. If you have similar (or better - or just different) examples please post them here. Always interesting to find what other people deem as OBVIOUS!!! For those of you out there curious if this is successful, today I have made 15 trades, and averaged 10 pips each trade! My biggest drawdown was less than 10 pips ! and no losses !!!! If I can do it ANYONE CAN!!!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Interesting indicator - do you have the file?? Looks similar to ind-gg I downloaded a while back

--- 帖子 #35 ---
no i just took some part of that program i want to change the title

--- 帖子 #36 ---
here it is again

--- 帖子 #37 ---
This looks intersting. I'll try it out tonight (London Session).

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Interesting (well for me it is!) Just thought I would upload a 1Hr chart to show that it should be as effective on the 1hr chart just as much as the 1min chart. One of the drawbacks is that you have to monitor price action constantly for any changes. If you cannot do that, then simply use the same principles but on a larger timeframe. Just remember the stop loss will increase significantly with the larger timeframes! Indeed with this system there is no reason why you could just check the price once a day, and then if you spot a trade go for it!! SIMPLES!!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I am planning on trying it on 5min timeframe with GU and EJ pairs during the first 3-4 hours of london open. I am still confused on the candle patterns you look for when taking a trade? Is it the pin bar/engulfing pattern at the tip of boilinger band you look for?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
If you've made @150pips today with no losses as expected really, then you have a eye for that setup, REPEAT keep repeating, keep upping your lot size as your account grows and RETIRE!! Easy Stick to M1 totally different world on every other TF, there okay for long term holds but useless for quick in and outs like your doing. enjoy

--- 帖子 #41 ---
here it is show me how you would trade it

--- 帖子 #42 ---
more clear charts

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Is that reply for me ..

--- 帖子 #44 ---
AndsX, the patterns I am looking for are "extreme" moves in the candles. They may appear near the edge of the Bollinger Bands - and these will tend to be the strongest, but can appear anywhere. There are patterns that keep repeating over and over, when you look for them they are obvious. Just go over previous charts and you will see this. When I get some spare time I shall try and post them on here - but trust me, when you see them a few times they become obvious! I have already posted a few as a start, but they are all fairly similar, also I have noticed that between 13.30 and 3.30 BST over the past few weeks there is typically a narrowing of the bands, followed by a sharp candle, that has signaled a 100 + pip move. As sure as eggs are eggs this wont happen today, but would be interesting if it did don't you think!!!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
OK first signal I spotted today 06:21 BST eur/usd. I am based in UK, so please from now on assume BST for all my timings. Also note eur/Jpy and Gbp/usd are very similar

--- 帖子 #46 ---
OK I did not trade this signal, however at 0634 I personally would have been out. Either I would have hit a 10-15 pip profit target, OR as the candle at 0634 I would have called it manually. However this time of the day, looks quite a tight range on eur/usd so might sit out for a while

--- 帖子 #47 ---
0650 GBP usd buy

--- 帖子 #48 ---
OK as I am updating live, I have moved the stop loss to +5 pips (as I am not keeping a watchful eye - I am updating this live. Just as I say that I am stopped out at +5.2 pips on a mini pullback, but the signal has continued to rise. using FXCM mini account stopped out at 1.5013, but peaked at over 1.502 and pulled back. (but I suspect will go above 1.502) Thus a good 10 pips was available on this one (so had I traded the first - I would already be 25 pips up! 1pip/minute not that bad (at least for a newbie like me!!)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
OK 0701 just spiked above 1.502, so a move is coming (tweezer top? = down) so there is some resistance at 1.50244 by my charts. As that is near a round(ish) number suspect there could be a move towards 1.5050 if it breaks 1.5030, otherwise a move to below 1.5000 if breaks 1.5010

--- 帖子 #50 ---
OK spotted a signal that happened 10 mins ago on eur/usd (A black cloud candle formation??) the ema/ sma at the base of the graph (suggested by turveyd)are as follows: ema: 3 sma : 5,13 Handy that it occured at edge of bollinger band. Also note the relatively longer candle (5th red candle). That in itself could be the ringing of the cash till!!!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
OK, The candle at 0705 was proof for me that this was a downer, and price has just hit the 1.5 (definitely a sweet spot value!) and fell below it Next targets will probably 1.4975, 1.4950, 1.4925 (based on what I understand of sweet spot theory)

--- 帖子 #52 ---
OK 0723 just saw a nice 20 pip move from 0705 to 0723 on £/$ (again 1pip / minute+ seems to be the rate here!!) Again, don't mind missing out on these early pips if it helps you guys (so far spotted min 50 pips in around an hour on £/$) These are not exceptional moves - little and often....... "If things don't change they will stay as they are!!"

--- 帖子 #53 ---
OK forgot to add the other side of the sweet spot targets (pretty important considering I just made 20 pips+ the other way!!! 1.5025, 1.5050, 1.5075 sweet spots = "round numbers" - round numbers .00, .5 Also in between these .25, .75 as £/$ has just bounced around 1.5025, there may be some merit in this theory!! Total pips spotted so far £/$ 5 May 09 - 80 pips 0740 (1hr 10 mins) As i say people - this is NOT rocket science!!!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Saw a move at 0740 £/$ buy. very quickly moved into profit so moved my stop loss to +2.5 ( hence could not lose!) However climbed to 12 pips so was going to set my stop loss to 10, but profit fell below 10. Then had pullback so was stopped out at +2.5 pips. However move continues and as I speak, and had I not moved the stop, would be around +25 pips and rising!! Moral of the story well I could say I am upset at not getting 25pips, but equally I am happy as it was a win!!! To me actual profits are always better than potential profits!!! Just to clarify (total pips spotted (as of 0750 100+ ) Hope this helps you guys with your trades. Remember I've been doing this for less than a year!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
You make it look all simple I got to try in real time. Are you using the MA's and BB's to confirm the trades?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi psqm.....you might consider adding the sweet spots - aka physcological levels as price frequently reacts to these levels and they are good places for entries and to take profits - but view them as bands ~5/10 pips wide. Then, when you know how the pair you are trading reacts to these levels you can take partial profits or exit all of your trade..... There are many examples in this thread..... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...98028&amp;page=173 Hope this helps..... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi AndsX, That was the whole point of this thread!! The human brain has a limited capacity for processing multiple pieces of information at any one time (I believe fighter pilots call it information overload). Anything more than 5 separate pieces of information starts to get tricky (just try monitoring 5 currency pairs on 1min charts for signals manually!!) So the key to success is K.I.S.S. (keep It Simple Stupid). The less information you have on the screen the more your brain is able to process that information. As a result, with no indicators, it should be able to spot these signals on 2 currency pairs simultaneously. (I personally only trade 1 pair at a time, but there is no reason why I have to stick with 1 currency pair all day!) The more indicators you have on the screen the more complex it is to process. I will point out at this time that I would consider a cross of moving averages as 1 indicator! If you find you need multiple indicators, and you are comfortable using them as the saying goes "if it ain't broke don't fix it!" But as long as you follow simple rules you can't go far wrong!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Here is my modified Sweet Spot MT4 thingy, dotted lines so there less obtrusive and it also draws a stronger BID Line making it easier to see. Looks good, if not for pesky stops catching you out, you just can't run stops that tight you need to take some chances or you'll be making peanuts all the damn time.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Good morning all, TurveyD I have attached a screenshot of a setup of what I believe are the moving averages you suggested a couple of days ago. This may be a stupid question (please forgive - newbie ;-) ), but am I right in thinking that a signal has occured when the 3 has crossed the 6, then both through the 13? Also is it best to wait for that minute / candle to close before accepting as crossed? The reason I ask, is that in a ranging currency, I am getting lots of bounces, and therefore, if I took every signal, I would be seriously out of pocket!! (due to 3 pip spread from my broker) How can I filter out these effective false signals. I assume increasing the timeframe would increase the price movements, but would also increase my stop losses, and amplify losses if I get it wrong!! One last point - you put on the end of your messages - 15pip SL ( or similar ), again apologies if silly question but is the inclusive of spread or do you recommend I add this (i.e. 3ppi spread takes the SL to 15). I guess in 6 months I'll look back on this comment and laugh, but at the mo I need the info!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
15 inclusive, playing with the exact value with a demo account currently though, used to use 13 fine but the markets choppier these days. The Chop is a issue for everyone, sadly the only way around it is to use your brain and only trade when you think it'll be something meaningful to trade. As to what cross I trade well :- Choppy Market 3ema crosses 5sma. More the market strength the more your going to want to wait for the later ones.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Well been simplifying the system, too many lines, too confusing, too much conflicting info. So whats Important ??? A. The CURRENT Direction. How do we see this on a M1 chart. A. 20SMA. so 3EMA ( Smoothed price line ), 20SMA ( Envelope 20,0.20% to been highlight direction ) , 60sma as a longer trend change line. Easy, below 20sma and market in a trend time zone ( The last hour ), hold short and vice versa. I'm trying to pick bottoms and tops again, in a trendy market = account death!! Why / how I slipped back to this is another question after a good run, most annoying

--- 帖子 #62 ---
OK I see, using the smaller timeframe during periods of choppiness makes sense, as the potential profits are less! Just dabbled today using the 3,6,13 method, and have to admit 1 was finger trouble, but 3 hits out of 4 for a first attempt isn't bad. I also set my TP at 15 pips, and they all hit. Nice system and adds confirmation to my signals (which is always a good thing in my book) Keep up the good work!!! Finally, the template you first put on here (with many sma/ema) do you have any "how to" info on that? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Change the 60sma to 50sma it back fits better. Thanks dude, you brought me back to KISS

--- 帖子 #64 ---
My bad habit is getting out of a trade too early. I have been setting TP to 15, then when it gets close I move the goalpost to 20, then I get a small pullback, so set my stop loss to +10 (hey profit right!!) Then sure enough trade closes - I'm happy, then watch the signal continue on down for another 80 pips!!! (not so happy) Before I would get frustrated and try and rejoin the trade (and sure as eggs are eggs lose all my gains and some). Not anymore- stick to my guns, and wait for the next good signal to come along - after all I have 24 hours to trade!! 10 - 20 pips 10 times a day is more than enough for me. I also try and make it less intimidating by going for 30 pips on 3-4 separate currencies. then in my mind I am only looking for 30 pips a day each time (rather then "straining" for 100 pips on a single currency) Also find I don't suffer from currency tunnel vision that way

Sorry Turveyd (do you mind if I just use TD?) I agree trading is all about judgement calls - as I said right near the start of this thread - the best indicator of all is the mark one eyeball! Has been in development for millions of years!!!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Apologies for not responding earlier. With regards to your question - I cannot disagree with ANY of those signals!!! From how I read this indicator - after a star is changed to an arrow - and the arrows on the graphs appear to occur on what I consider obvious signals!! Indeed it looks like it could work as the only indicator. Did you create this yourself - It looks like a modified ind-gg01 indicator to me. As with all indicators like this, they are fine if you are using MT4, but unfortunately I have FXCM as a broker, and there trader software does not accept MT4 indicators. Which means I have to have 2 screens open when I want to trade (however if it works I cannot argue!!) Keep up the good work

I'm trying to become more of a Trend trader rather than Chop at a client at the moment, but I'll send my new template when I get back. Having difficulty being on the right side so just 3ema, 20sma, 50sma and a envelope 20,0.20% to make the direction easier to see currently. So basically trying to trade the 20min direction, it would made a fair few pips on the EU and EJ earlier, less others to consider, less fake signals less stress putting the focus back onto price action I feel is important here. Got to get back to my 6weeks, without 1 losing trade, just can't work out for the life of me what I was doing different. TD's fine!! Or anything really!!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Swall, I have attached a copy of the ind-gg01 I was refering to ( and a screenshot of it superimposed on the indicator you kindly posted) Just looking from the chart, it appears ind gg-01 potentially picks up more of the trend (but it could simply be a fluke with the settings I have) I have attached the mq4 file so you can look at the code and alter at will!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
OK everyone, Have to admit really overwhelmed by the great response to this thread so far. Just thought it might be an idea to produce a template of what I have gleaned from all your comments. The entire thread is all about K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid). So ANY system displayed on here should bear that in mind. I am fully aware that I started off stating that indicators are not needed - and this IS true, however to ignore good advice just to prove a point is just wrong!!! Anyway, the template includes the indicator SWALL gave me, and from TD, I have used 3ema, 6sma, and the dotted line is the bollinger (I'm using ALPARI's MT4 so not sure how to resize. How I would use this there are a number of entry considerations (I wont say rules as they could be broken!!! 1) The bollinger band has been touched / breached 2) The 3/6 lines have crossed 4) The GG01 indicator is blue for buy, red for sell (could enter before if you see an OBVIOUS signal) 5) An "OBVIOUS" move has occured I like to think this could be considered a simple setup (would appreciate thoughts from everyone). But certainly as far as I am concerned, any more indicators, will just add clutter. I would suggest any improvements must simplify, not merely add extra information (there are MANY MANY systems that can cater for that). Ideally the gg01 indicator could possibly be improved by only showing the start and end signals (not sure if this is possible/ practical). Whatever you guys come up with, please feel free to share it here - just remember to add all relevant files (including templates if required) and if possible include just the mq4 files so others can check the logic used. Much appreciated and good hunting everyone!!!

To save time for everyone this should refer to the other indicator HE WHO LAUGHS LAST - DID NOT GET THE JOKE STRAIGHT AWAY

Well here is my simpler more KISS Setup!!! 3EMA 6EMA 20EMA 50EMA Envelope 20sma, 0.20% Dev ( this is just to reinforce 20sma direction and give me a instant what scale my charts at, those huge looking swings for 6pips annoy me LOL ) Shorts below 20SMA, Longs above, simple enough ?? Use the 50sma the same, so only shorts below 20sma and below 50sma and vice versa, likely also worth while factoring in the direction of travel. It looks to work well enough with EJ even in chop to just about make a profit so think Breaking even I guess, but then you'll get 100pip moves like on the attached chart, which makes up for the chop times

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hopefully got Thursday free ish to do a full on Demo forced trade and see how it fairs so expect more changes. I say forces, cause I trade very well when I casually watch and place the odd trade, it's when I try to make a trade outta any given situation the money vapourises from my account 6weeks without a loss, then okay time to take it seriously and account GONE

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Update no.1 of 4Mil :- the 50sma stays, but added a 55 and 60sma, use them all as 1 SMA creates a kinda no mans land, which reduces the chop nicely and makes it very very visible of Don't trade against me OR ELSE Ofcourse the entire area between 20sma and 50sma is a no mans land deal as can't trade. Will add, if your in near the 20sma and it pops over and heads to the 50sma if the 50sma is near good odds the direction will still hold, so hold and reverse position when back over 50sma.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Definatley something in this KISS stuff, since my return ( on Demo ) EJ +17 +32, just broke under my 3 SMA lines ( 50,55,60) +10 and climbing!! License to print money and rules so simple my rats could trade for me

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Been back testing frantically tonight and forward testing and it's SO SO SO SO easy you can't really cock it up, keeps you on the right side of the trend, small SL Risk, average twice the Profit to SL add in some when to trade experience and looking at @90% win rate, trading everything still 50%+ so should be profitable. It's a 3EMA / 8SMA Cross on there, still use this to enter when the rules apply with the trend rather than risky the market blowing through on you. Here is EJ, GU and EU Templates.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
And GU!!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Change the 3 SMA's, to 55/60/65. Add another +23 to EJ

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Just downloaded TD's examples, and looks very useful but have 1 constructive criticism. I have changed the colour of the 50 sma from goldenrod to red, simply so that it is OBVIOUS !!! (I like to make each different line as different a colour as possible - again KISS applies) Feel free to comment!!!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
TD could I just check, are you saying that once the price has closed above / below the 50,55,60 lines, then that is a trade? And would it be correct that the SL is just above / below these 3 lines (dynamically) or is it still a fixed 15 pip? OR is it the 3 crosses the 8 and then the 20? Apologies if you have stated this previously , but hey its early and I am hard of thinking 8-) Also today (Thu 7 May 2009), so typically told to stay clear - is this sage wisdom, or folly? Interesting if big swings could be relatively easily picked up using this technique (demo only though please!!!)

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Just attached a screenshot to illustrate what I think. You say below 20 sell, above 20 buy. However (at least on the most recent chart) there would only be one trade in nearly 2 hours as far as I can see there is only 1 crossover above the 20 sma. However if you mean crossover and go through 20 sma, then there are loads (see attached)!

Loads of trades on EJ over the night, some 40+ pip moves called aswell, not seeing any losers but eyes barely working going back to sleep. EU working well to, GU not as well. Will post chart with enty and exits highlighted later.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
130pip EJ move on the table and still going, caught by these simple rules, abit take you outty on the 20sma being lightly broken so you'd of needed some faith in the direction to hold all the way. abit choppy before, but expected at that time reckon -20 if you tried to play the chop as 1 winner, 2 losers but not by alot. This is the kinda move I want to get regular, a few of these 140pip moves of EJ per week and account growth will go through the roof, get the account upto $10 per pip and thats a £1500 morning COME ON BABY!!!! * off to shout at FXCM for losing no.2 cheque LOL *

--- 帖子 #84 ---
What time did this move start? Trying to spot exactly the signals

--- 帖子 #85 ---
an 80 pip drop in 2 mins on the Eur/USD!!! Nerves of steel required to trade during news!!! Interestingly, this system indeed would have been in for the sell!!!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
psgm or turveyd.. so many changes to the MA.. can some one give us all the current moving averages plus the rules for the system, thanks guys for all your hard work, keep the explation simple if you can.. Danny

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Rebel, The ema/sma system I am using is merely a variation of TD's technique. I use 3ema, 6 sma, and 13 sma as my trigger signals. TDs system uses envelope 20,0.2%, so I can use it on MT4, but my broker is FXCM, so not sure if I have it available - so I use default Bollinger Bands. For me, the signals where the Bollinger band has been breached and retraced, and the 3,6 has crossed. Crossing through the 13 is an even stronger signal. TD as I understand it uses the bounce off the 20 sma as his signal. Not sure which is more effective - perhaps you could let us know what you get. I'm looking forward if TD gets chance to break down a trade (if possible step by step (i.e screenshot of entry point, screen shot of exit point, and any relevant settings) Big ask perhaps, but certainly it would help me, as I am not 100% in my head when I would pull the trigger (I'm sure it is very simple, but a picture of the exact entry chart, would help immensely - after all a picture tells a 1000 words!)

--- 帖子 #88 ---
PSGM, I have ZERO intention of trading news, my SL / risk aversion simply isn't enough. Danny. To keep my new baby REAL simple ( Like me ) :- 20SMA 60SMA ( with a 55sma and 65sma to filter chop ) is all you really need. If the market is above the 20SMA and the 50SMA look to hold Longs pick your own entry based on this, ie best you can get near the 20sma if possible. So, if the market is going down, moves above the 20sma then above the 60sma range go LONG. If your holding a short when it moves up over the 20sma and the 50sma is near, it's your call weather to hold or not depending on the Price action. Breaks the 50sma OUT no questions. But do not enter any trades when price is between the 20sma and 50sma thats no mans land. Common sense and knowing when to trade is required to minimalise losses from chop as per always, although it doesn't fair to bady on EJ which best suites this setup due to it's higher average pip move!! Enjoy, will scrible stuff on a chart shortly.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I found no benefit to a BB or the Envelope trade wise, makes you into too much of a bottom fisher for my likings and generally that'll wipe your account. I like the fixed Envelope ( it's under oscillators on MT4 ), cause it's always a fixed value apart ( well pretty much ), Envelope is close together then it alerts me to the scale of the chart, thats all!!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
As I said a pic says a 100 words, fair point I should include one of my own. Please forgive the lack of clarity of the lines (FXCM platform is terrible for this kind of thing - cannot even get thick lines!!!) I have manually drawn in yellow arrows to highlight the 3/6 crossover points. Note there are other crossovers, I have only picked those that have touched the Bollinger band and changed direction. Not 100% sure, but I think on each occasion recognised reversal patterns had formed (But I am sure if I am wrong someone will let me know!)

--- 帖子 #91 ---
OKay here is 1 chart, let me know if you understand or how I can explain better please.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Dude, download a MT4 platform :- http://www.alpari.co.uk/ Just use it in Demo for EVER Shelve your system for abit please, I think my new 1 is easier, more mechanical and out performs but a 2nd eye on it is always appreciated.

Thanks lads...that explains alot.. keep the screen shots coming.. all the best from Ireland.. Danny The wise man knows, what he doesn't know..

--- 帖子 #94 ---
That is exactly what I wanted!! It clearly shows when you entered, and when you exited. I can see it uses the crosses just after a hit of the Bollinger (ish) One question (sorry if already answered) What do the 55,60,65 provide? If you are relying on the 3/6 cross, and the 20sma as trend what are they used for? What does the envelope provide? I set up the 3/6 cross with bollinger bands on FXCM, and looked at price action of EJ EU during the news, and pretty much all of the moves would have been hit!! That was around 300 pips (if you took buys and sells) To me your system is proved, now lets see if I can use it properly. I am going to try it out live for the next couple of weeks, by then it will be thoroughly field tested (as far as I am concerned) Once testing has been completed, I am considering live "FOREX RACES" basically a currency will be picked, then there will be a sprint (25 pips) middle distance (50 pips) and long distance (100 pips) AS it would be just for fun, demo only (unless you are 100% confident then go for it live!!) so for example we could have to 50m ej hurdles!! (trading can be fun!!!) Again this is just a thought, and until I have tested this live, I won't be started, but if anyone would be interested in this, or improving just use this thread!! Is this the set up you provided in the template a few posts back? Finally TD I have downloaded Alpari's MT4 but broker is FXCM, so need 2 screens open (But hey not impossible)

--- 帖子 #95 ---
TD just took 93 points out of the FTSE futures using the system on a 5 min live account.. Live the dream Danny

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Just dawned on me as I was looking at the charts. The position is long when the candle has closed above the 55,60,65!! And the exit is on the cross of either the 3/6 or 3/13 (depending on the candle!) I suspect as well as the exit for the sell will then act as the entry for a buy! I dread to think how many pips this system can catch!!! Just a thought - is it essential to have 55,60,65? Would 55,65 be as good? Very nice work TD - you ought to trade the forex!!! Just makes you think all these people charging a fortune for convoluted system - starting to sound like snake oil salesmen!!! 1 lot x30 pips 5 days a week is $1500/wk!! I don't think 30 pips/day is impossible with this system!!!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
OK guys bit of a cheeky ask, but anyone fancy rating this thread so far? If you think I have something then let me know, if not then please let me know!! Hopefully it is a useful platform!!!

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I presume the strong mechanical method TD has put on here, is there anyone out there who could produce a simple buy arrow sell arrow type indicator? The entry methods are clear and simple as are the exit rules, so I am sure it would be possible. It would be easy enough to test how effective it is by superimposing it on the template. Now that is a template I would REALLY like to see in action!!! Anyone up to the challenge??? If I don't ask I don't get!!! 93 pips!!!! Who said trading had to be complicated (K.I.S.S.)

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Great job psgm. I appreciate you starting this thread with this method. I have been following it much as i can. Also thanks to Turveyd for your special knowledge and adding to this strategy! I will plan on using this technique/method and test it on the 1 min and 5min. I have just an idea regarding trading the 1 min. It could help or not and have'nt tested yet. Maybe another filter. 1. This applies to Short or Longs. If you trade the 1min .---First check the 5min. chart to see if it's in a uptrend or downtrend according to the rules. 3 &amp; 6 have crossed already and close of candles are above or below all 55,60,65. This should help keep you on the short or long side of the trend direction. NOW YOU CAN DETERMINE IF YOUR TRADES INITIALLY WILL BE ONLY SHORT OR LONG FOR THE MOMENT on the 1 min timeframe . This is just an idea,not sure how effective it would be, best to test or maybe someone can redefine it as i said. Just my 2 cents. Is there a current template that is being used as of right now? Thanks

--- 帖子 #100 ---
That is the why I started this thread FX CASH!! I discussed this thread with a friend of mine who has NEVER traded before! He is going to try it out next week on a demo account - I will keep you all informed as to his progress!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Errr okay TO MANY Posts :- Pretend the Envelope isn't there, its just so I can judge the scale of my chart as a reference dont' trade off it. Yep 55/65 would work, I like the 3 but irrelevant, it just provides a not to fussy range. 93pips, where's my commision then NICE. Although only designed as a M1 I guess it'll work on all TF's. I have a 5min just to see the days movement easily in 1 hit. A EA could work ( I'm a programmer ) just got to teach it what times to trade, as it would back test fine I could use the back test data to refine the times, in a attempt to ignore the chop times like I try to do anyway, and just switch it on and off at certain volatile times, or tell it don't trade between X and X Friday, easy!! It does look really promising and super super easy which I like, the GU for instance netted a @50pip down move, then when it broke back above the 55/65 range a further 25pips, sadly EJ's chopping around aimlessly.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Templates!! EU and EJ!! Feel free to delete the Envelope if it's adding confusion to the issue. Remember I trade off the EMA3 crossing lines not the BID price, it just filters out noise which its too easy to react to badly, doesn't lag to far behind, if you find it too slow try EMA2 instead.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
And here is good old GU. If you can only trade 1, trade EJ, possibly only trade EJ to be honest. enjoy!!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Really does not fail does it, although on the EJ just it went short, retraced abit stopped just under the 55-65 right as they crossed over so the SMA's turned down then dropped nicely, impressive. I put my confusing 120sma and 240sma back in and I can see and get out on alot of the chop, retrospectively it does add exits really, but leaving them out, KISS baby!! Remember a move under the 20sma then back over is still a potential buy signal, did on the EJ 22:58 ( my chart ) 132.64 area then ran for 30pips, nice!!! Confidence is so high it's unreal

--- 帖子 #105 ---
EJ, back tested trade for Thursday going to take all moves so including Chop and the pain / losses from it. Okay :- ( these are realistic profits and losses, no perfect entry / exit BS ) +9 +18 +30 +12 +30 +20 ( +40 with balls to hold for max ) -10 -10 Chop alert!! +15 -5 +15 +7 +10 -10 -10 ( more chop ) +120 ( WOWSA who cares about the 4 losers for -40 ) -10 -10 -10 ( yep chopped around ) +30 ( got them back ) NEWS TIME will never trade +40 +30 +35 +10 -25 ( worst loser yet, would hit my SL so -20 ) +20 BE -12 +5 +35 -15 +5 -10 -15 +50 Thats +394 pips LOL 21 Profits, 13 Losers = 34 trades in total, win 61% average pips per trade 11.5!! That'll do me, that was 24hours though with no attempt to not trade chop on a good EJ day I'll add with huge moves!!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Add in some brain power and likely get to 70-80% profit ratio. Then add in the pips from EU and GU. Say 6hour trading day, 2 x 3hour blocks picking the best times and should be able to take +200pips per day between the 3 pairs I'd guess. Those losses where worst case and the profits 80% efficent which is realistic!!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
It works on M5 if you REALLY have to, M15 there just isn't enough info. Interestingly though D1 holds up well for your long term holders, got all the move down from 162 to 115 area , abit slow for my likings though!! W1 and MN work well to, for all you once a month internet access people with huge SL's

--- 帖子 #108 ---
That is fantastic TD. A simple yet effective solution. Now the icing on the cake - do you have either a screenshot, or the timings of the trades??? Once again a big ask, but then everyone will be able to see PRECISELY how when and where to trade this. Also we can all look for the choppy time, learn to recognise it, and ultimately how to avoid it!! I'd like to say cannot ask for more - but just have!!! (just being greedy I suppose!) Out of curiosity - you mention 2x 3hr blocks, what times would you suggest? (UK timings) please. As we used to say in Navy BZ shippers!! (BZ = Well done!! - Don't ask me why!!)

Thanks Pip Rider for the kind words - perhaps me and TD could arrange a live seminar someday (obviously for a large price ;-) ) Anyway as promised earlier, I have just received an email from my from who up until wednesday 6 May had never even SEEN a forex chart!! For those who are unaware, earlier this week, I convinced an old navy buddy of mine to demo trade the forex for a week, using the latest methodology that has evolved on this thread (I was going to say I posted - however that would be taking far too much credit - which should rightfully go to Turveyd - I merely got the ball rolling!!!) Anyway Last night I received this message (about 11pm) Remember - he had not even SEEN a chart 2 days ago. the only "education" he had was a 1 hour chat with me - including how to load and install Alpari MT4 demo!!! I do not know his lot sizes, but will assume they are default Alpari MT4 settings (1 lot) as that was what I set him u pwith "well.. I am £775 up at the moment from about two hours of actively looking at it all!" To me that is all the validation I need!!!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Folks, I've noticed this Bollinger band pattern so many times, that I thought U would share it with you all. I call it the Camel's Head, simply because it reminds me of a camel wearing a bridle!!! It is a continuation pattern. basically the "ears" are the start of the pattern, the price then falls (the bridle). when the price returns to the start of the bridle that is the buy signal! I am sure it would be simply the opposite for a sell signal, but this is a pattern I look for and is quite successful (but I do not have specific stats to back this up!!!) See if you see what I see ( or am I just visiting from the planet crazy!!!)

--- 帖子 #112 ---
to F*&amp;k up takes a trader. Did I make a mistake, or is it fair comment - you be the judge... at Entry point #1 I saw what I considered a sell signal. So I entered with my 15 pips SL. It failed. However at Entry point #2 I saw another sell, so I entered and am in profit. So does this count as a failure on my part????? For my defence I would say no - simply because once you start changing your rules to fit a particular instance, where does it lead?? If you have a rule stick to it - there is no such thing as a prefect system !! 8-)

Hi psgm. Have a look at the screenshot. At the arrow I went long and it went down. Is this just one of those or I have missed something? Thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Yes I can see why you entered, a large upturn, and the crossover. Will be interesting to see how this one pans out (It could just be a larger swing than usual) Looking back (hence the title!!) it was part of a relatively long downtrend. However, It could also be the start of a double bottom. Assuming this is based on the most recent (ie time now 0829 bst for me), it looks as if indeed a double bottom is forming, in which case you were correct to enter! From my figures (taking purely from FXCM ) Spread approx 3 pips and the "retracement" was about 5 pips, so with 15 pip SL you should still be in! Not only that, but also should be starting to make profit (so if unsure of the trade bail out!!) As a rule of thumb if you make a trade and it falls once but recovers, no probs continue in the trade. If it struggles a second time, and you are still in profit. get out, and look for another strong signal. If it struggles then perhaps it was not as strong as you first thought. If it struggles a 3rd take take the money and run - it has not panned out! These things happen - you could have simply found the start of a period of consolidation - in which you want to be looking for another opportunity anyway!! If nothing else it appears you have got the basis of my theory - practice makes prefect!!! I cannot and will not say that the price will fly immediately, or indeed every signal will win, but it looks like your spider senses were indeed correct in the first place. This is what I found, trust your "spider senses" a 5-10 pip retracement is always a possibility - at 15 pips SL, it isn't going to break the bank, and relatively easy to make that back next time. Finally if this has helped please give me a rating you feel appropriate to its usefulness - I'm a nervous creature and need the validation ;-)

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Ok correct me if I am wrong, but this is how I see you trade has gone so far..... It didn't pan out (at least not yet!), but its been a relatively long time for little reward. had I entered that trade I think I would have been less than 3 pips down on that trade - so if nothing else you have reduced your losses - which in my book is a bonus! Hope this helps!!!

The clue is in the title!!! I shall go through why I would have chosen this.... 1) Has just bounced off the top of the Bollinger band 2) Has had 3 consecutive downward candles (3 black crows???) 3) Has had a 3/6 crossover 4) Has had a 3/13 crossover 5) Even has had a 3/120 crossover!!! Good for a 10 pips methinks!!!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Good Job sir (I'm assuming sir!!!!) Could you put up a chart with the entry points of these trades??? The more signals we can see, the easier the become to spot!!! Great work everyone. I'm off for a short while now, I am becoming hard of thinking, and need a little break!!

[quote=psgm;2720790]Yes I can see why you entered, a large upturn, and the crossover. Will be interesting to see how this one pans out (It could just be a larger swing than usual) Hi psgm, It is definitely helpful.

Hi all - could well break the 10K hits in a week for this thread today!!! (not bad for my first ever thread!!) Anyway, just getting back to Horn's question earlier (and this will be the last time for this particular as i cannot think of any more useful discussion about 1 trade!) However I have attached a chart to show had his SL been 25-30 pips He could have made a profit on that particular trade of around 15 pips!) However, you then get into the how long is a piece of string scenario whereby you widen and widen your stops until it isn't worth placing a stop loss as you have emptied your account!!! For me stick to a level you are comfortable with (15 pips roughly equates to £20 per trade) potential loss at 0.2 lots. Then depending on your risk / confidence level raise the lot size 0.1 lots / £500 additional trading fund. £500 would roughly equate to 700 pips at (£0.66- $1) per 0.1 lots. Using this method 600 pips is a hell of a lot of mistakes!!!( 400 consecutive mistakes at 15 pip SL) Not sure if this inline with money management principles, but it is a simple way for me to quantify how much I can risk!! E.g. Starting trading account £500 - therefore trade 0.1 lots, £1000 0.2 lots £10,000 2 lots Simples!!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
As sure as eggs are eggs a classic illustration of the point crops up!! Once again a similar setup occured as did the trade initially taken by Horn (I am not picking on you H - promise!) As I hope you all can see there was a long downtrend followed by a pullback. The reason I selected this one, was because on the downtrend there had been no significant pullback. With virtually all long term trades, at some point the price will try to pullback. True a potential buy signal was generated, however "trend is your friend" is just as true. If you have an account with 0 spread / commission you could have made money on that particular trade - but I haven't found one yet - if you guys know of one then please let me know!! The trade example highlighted had a 3 black cloud formation, had just bounced off a Bollinger band, had a 3/6 cross and an "Obvious" candle. Also by a cunning coincidence it was even around a round Forex number 1.3400!! It did not retrace by 15 pips, so would have gone on to make a profit!! (particularly as I look for only 10-15 pips per trade!)

I tried this live a little this morning.... but i`m probabily doing it wrong as i lost arround 70 pips so far. I`ll keep trying who knows maybe i`ll get it working^.^ I`ll keep you posted, just wanted to say hi

Okay confused, still using my system here looks different, could be cause I just woke up though. Someone posted a fail, a move over the 20sma, but it didn't move over the 60sma, so you where still in a 6omin down channel, thats why it failed, needs to cross both. Remember multiple trades can be taken where the market moves back over the 20sma in the direction of the 60min. Was that live profits posted from this cool. PGM you in the UK, me to, where ?? Times, 9:30-12:00 ( rarely up at this time ) I guess 2:30 - 5:30 my normal. and 00:30 - 02:30am good asian trendy ness there, I'm a night owl. Off to see new star trek film today and skiving

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Please practice on demo first, I don't like them getting our $$$'s The main basis is, price above 20sma and 55-65 sma go Long ( do not go short it's against the trend ) and Vice Versa. What happened ?? SL's to close ?? or did you try to use it when the market was dead and choppy ??

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Really sorry to hear about your losses. Perhaps if you can post a screenshot of when you entered and exited those trades a solution may present itself. My main criteria for a trade...... 1) Bounced off bollinger band 2) have had a 3/6 cross 3) an OBVIOUS candle pattern was formed. When you make a trade - ensure a 15 pip SL. I take it from the fact you lost 70 pips (which is not dividable by 15) you exited some trades early, OR had stop losses greater than 15 pips. the more criteria that support your trade decision, the better that decision is likely to be. I suggest next time before you trade, have a checklist of entry conditions. If it fits your criteria go for the trade - if it doesn't wait until it does!! I promise you there are more than enough trades going on during the day (even if you have to use more than 1 currency!!) remember at todays rate 1 lot at 30 pips 5 times a week is over £1000 / wk!!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
The market was too choppy.... I`m using a micro account and very small lots, i didn`t lose much so np, besides i deserve it if i can`t make a proven system work for me.^.^ I already saw how and why i made mistakes, i`m hoping not to repeat them again I`m glad the system works. I`ll get it working for me eventually But from what i saw looking back on the charts and so on, it`s a great system so thank you for sharing! EDIT: Yes i exited a few trades early, thinking it will turn(it didn`t). Also sometimes i must do 16-17 pips sl`s as my broker`s(FxClub) platform only allows stop losses 11 pips away from the price... so 5 pips spread(E/J) + 11 = 16.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Cool as its summer, I'm getting up 6.30 GMT, so will prob do the first 2 sessions. Friday is pick up kids day, so very little trading, as prior to this I was losing and I don't want to pick up the kids feeling grumpy over the weekend because I made a loss! However I can see because of the short time frames and the effectiveness of your method I can now do some good on a Friday. As for my screenshots, I have tried to create your method on my FXCM trading platform (In an attempt to illiminate the 2 open screens problem I would have) Hence I have used Bollinger instead of Envelopes (I also think it possibly adds an extra piece of useful info as it is closer to the price action) But I think I have the CORE.... 3 ema 6 sma 13 sma Sure I'd like thicker lines dotted lines etc, but as I haven't / cannot be bothered to learn the archaic method FXCM uses to code custom indicators I shall improvise overcome adapt. BTW title should answer your question TD. P.S. I had a thought that as I call it a Camel's head for a buy, what do I call it for a sell - as I don't think it is quite appropriate to call it a Camel's Toe 8-) (lets see if that passes through the thought police !!!)

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Negatives: You lost 70 pips Positives: You spider senses told you that your trade was failing and you bailed early - you save yourself unnecessary losses stop losses 11 pips away + 5 pip spread! Methinks you need a new broker!!! I use FXCM - I am not saying they are the best, they are simply the ones I have been using - very happy to open a discussion on who is the best broker - but that is a separate issue For me EJ is typically in the 3 pip spread (sometimes more, sometimes less). However my stop losses can be as little as 0.1 pips!!! You can argue the toss over the spread (as it can vary and you could have been unlucky), but you should be able to set the stop losses YOU want. Hunt down a better broker for you. To everyone out there if there is a broker who stands out as low spread, hassle free payments, and good trading platform then PLEASE share on here. Don't give up, clearly your spider senses tingled at the right time to prevent unnecessary loss, take comfort from that, perhaps sit out the next trade and see if it pans out as you expected. Nothing better than to see your prediction validated (other than making money on that prediction!!)

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The core ?? 3ema, 8sma, 20sma, 55,60,65 sma is the core I think currently, sorry for changing it so often, but seem to be settled on that.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Don't worry too much about the SL, I haven't crunched the numbers yet 20pips is FINE, you'll be exiting manually when it reverses on you to preserve pips anyway. You should rarely during good hours take a loss anyway so 5pips here or there, who cares when you take a 130+ move regular ish.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Ohhhh forgot to say, likely worth taking the friday off, historically, friday is the choppyest day, Thursday being the best trending day. EJ's chopping currently, EU and GU having a uptrend move but very limited pips @30 on each, but that'll do.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
You are right i am wrong!!! I have amended my platform accordingly!! This is How I see TDs trades playing out ( forgive me if I have the wrong end of the stick completely BTW what part of UK you from then TD? If nothing else, it can be used for trade spotting practice!!!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
OK had a really gratifying couple of emails from my old shippers (slipping into navy speak for a mo!) who is in his first full day of Demo trading. I asked him what lot size he was using for his trades..... I'll summarise here. When you say lot size. Are you talking volume? If so 2,0 The account is a £3k account To be honest dude.. I am winning all the time.. It’s a little scary..... I am 'up' £1266 I wish! Lol Bearing in mind Friday is typically a bad day to trade, and he has no more than the system on this thread, the mk1 eyeball, and only installed the demop platform yesterday, I think it speaks volumes (except that you cannot get a volume indicator for forex!!!) SIMPLES

But I think I have the CORE.... 3 ema 6 sma 13 sma psgm, You refer to 3/6 cross as one of the criteria. How is the 13 sma being used then? Also the MA used by u and TD differs. It maybe confusing for some to follow.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Turveyd I have a question. When you say the trades should be obvious, do you mean whenever there are several consecutive bearish or bullish candles happen like a trend and then a reversal candle happens, this is the signal?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi Turveyd, Please review screenshot and advise whether I should go short at location with 1 arrow or with 2 arrows. I think it should be at 2 arrows which is below the 55-65 sma Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Turveyd, Another example for your advice. Arrow points to crossing of 3ema and 8sma. Not correct to go long cos below 20sma ( yellow line ) and 55-65 sma lines. Will have to wait until price go above 55-65 sma. Am I correct ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #142 ---
PSGM, 40miles from you in Kidderminster, I got to coventry sometimes. The settings I'm using are in the last Templates I sent. 3EMA 8SMA 20SMA 55,60,65SMA Horn, 2seconds editing your charts to highlight entrys. Don't worry to much about the 8sma well the 3ema crossing it, thats just to enter on longer 20min trend moves, will find a chart to highlight it and zoom right in.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Okay this is your period zoomed into my chart, hate those sticks your using and those Daily Pivots only work by chance really aren't worth the confusion, dump them is my advice. When you've got a trade and it's a new and hoving around BE use :- The 3ema crossing back over the 8sma as a sign to bail to be safe ( Maybe ) Then as the move stablishes use 3ema crossing the 20sma to give it more breathing room, then maybe even the 60, that way you can make the BIG 100pip moves when available.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Helps if I attach the chart Working on your chart 2 shortly.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Correct 14:58-14:59 is the correct time to go Long on that, bothering before that still has good odds on turning down, going back under the 20sma and signalling another short entry. Easy Remember these things are easy to see after the event, hard to see live. You do need to master trading to a level to avoid chop. Also EJ trades better generally.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
For my view, I would simply ask do YOU think it was a trade? Personally if the rules you are using that the price is above 55,60,65, then YES you MUST wait. If you are using the 3/8 cross as your rule, then you trade then. Whatever is the rule you choose, stick to it. I would have traded at the earlier 3/8 cross, but TD's call has less risk

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Just picked my lad up from Huntingdon, so have just arrived back from the A14!!!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I'd of traded on the early 3/8 before aswell, okay that time it worked out fine you got a better price, but most of the time it just kept the downtrend and slaughtered me. Hence wait for the move over safer, not giving it back is key to me.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Should have Monday free to post some live trade calls as I plan to demo trade it that day. I'll take a live snapshot of the chart at the entry time ( press Prt Screen ) and likewise when I exit then you can all see if we are on the same page. And also look for improvements, improvements are always good, says me who over complicated this system and turned it from a winner to a lose once before

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I'm following this thread with interest, although I will admit I do use another system which is inidicator based, and has reasonable success. What I can't understand is whenever I've dabbled with crossover systems before, I've been chopped to death. 5/8 crosses on a 1M in the direction of the 50MA is great when it works and kills you when it doesn't. Thats been my personal experience. So I'll be looking at this closely...... Cheers, Matt

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Just saw some potential trades (1 that happened, the other MIGHT)

--- 帖子 #152 ---
That's why I don't just rely on the crossovers!!! The initial thread was that you don't need indicators! It has evolved into using a few indicators. Certainly for me anymore indicators, will defeat the whole purpose of the thread. If it is possible to reduce the indicators needed whilst keeping the core functionality then great. For me any indicator, must add VALUE to the trade decision.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Well yes, but :- EJ Trends better and Chops Less. Avoiding Choppy market times is key also. Even taking the choppy trades for Thursday is got +394 pips or something, chop cost @150pips over the day, so acceptable kinda.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
EJ Short 133.83.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Bad example, dreeded chop LOL out -15 on this 1, hey it got a +50 on the previous trade setup!!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Why are your setting still not what the plan currently is

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Just a follow-up to the earlier potential trade - this is how it played out!! It always helps if you see a pattern occuring that confirms the buy signal!!! So the cross over between 1830 and 1845 had additional confirmation

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Well stop it your confusing me EU and GU same time ish as I posted the EJ trade both moved as per the system +30 and +40 NICE!!!! Where as EJ chopped typical LOL

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Turveyd your template is simply amazing. Good for 200 pips on G/U today - it caught all the big swings. I am having good success combining this setup with S/R and it pays to keep an eye on higher time frames. It really doesn't take long to start recognizing patterns and it seems to work well on multiple pairs on other TFs. This graph is just gorgeous:

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Yep, not knocking it at all. Just interested that it seems to be working so well. I'll always look out for pinbars, candles eating candles etc to help a trade decision but I reckon the key here is hanging on to the big winners and accepting a 60% hit rate. With my previous crossover system, it was 50-60 with a 1-1 RR. Hence I gave up. I don't really count MA's as indicators. To me, indicators are those lagging things that sit at the bottom of your screen. Although I do use a doublewoodie with some success. Keep the charts coming, I'll be demoing this next week when work commitments allow cheers, Matt

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Yep it's EASY which is key, and it gets enough of the big moves, like that to make the chop not such a issue, does help that the markets compared to this time last year are alot more trendy and less choppy to Just got to use your brain and try to avoid chop. I'm pretty much convinced at this point I'll be making A LOT of ££'s of trading just this over the coming months / years. You realise there are multiple entrys on the GU on the way up to get in safely ish if you miss the start right ??

--- 帖子 #162 ---
1-1RR is never going to work realistically. Thursday trading EJ over the 24hours 61% win rate, with no attempt to avoid chop +394 pips. No reason you couldn't trade that result live, it was realistic in all ways, given enough coffee ofcourse to sit and trade for 24hours straight. A EA won't work, still need a human brain to avoid chop, pick sensible exits before the cross down and hold sometimes despite a 20sma cross down.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thursday EJ more data :- Profit +546 Losses -152 So thats a 3.59:1 RR or 1:3.59 which ever. We'll add a extra 50% to the Losers to be safe so -228, still +318 on the day. RR drops to 2.4:1 area.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
so what is tf on this? I am assuming M1 mostly?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I'm trading M1 only, looks okay on M5 seems to even work on D1 and W1. But the moves I'm after are better seen to me on M1!!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
TD I am convinced following the crosses works! Got yet another message from my mate yesterday I shall quote what he said.. up £1615 no lost once yet!!!!! Not bad for a first day ever of demo trading. OK he was using 2 Lot on a 3000 account, but still that works out to well over 100 pips on his first day!!!!! With regards to the Camels Head pattern, I just put that up as a little exercise as I have seen it so many times and it seems to have a relative good track record. I'm going to start a thread on that pattern, so if anyone has any views on that, then please feel free to comment. Have a great weekend everyone!! 11765 06_05_09 0611

--- 帖子 #167 ---
As long as the market is trending, I'm convinced to, I've back checked it for a month on EJ GU EU its as near perfect as your going to get. Before the system woulda got me short ( on a down move ) below the 60sma, although it woulda worked multiple times on the EU today generally it hits the 20 for +10pips then reverses again and takes out the 60min creating a loss. Thats why I pulled all trades in that area, no enough consistency. My ownly thought to improve so far is, if the 55/65 sma's are heading up strongly, consider a break under high risk, wait for the 55/65 to flatten out a bit before jumping on blindly. The only issue is, removing chop to a high enough degree without missing out on good action in the process, I think we are going to have to accept some chop losses in short which is acceptable.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
hellooo turveyd, didn't know u were also a 1m guy i'm having a little headache on when 2 get out on the 1m. any ideas??

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Read my system above. depends on the setup, ( presume your long for all ), when the 3ema crosses under the 8sma is first, then under the 20sma is the next sell point if you want to risk it that far, then again for the 55-65sma range, above that is working well as your against the trend and very low odds it'll come back your way.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi TD, Just a quick question - I have just looked back on the charts with the template you posted - when did the 6sma change to the 8sma? That was why I have been stating 3/6 cross? Could you upload your most recent template (with any simplifications you have made) That is probably why my charts are differing to yours!!! Just to recap (for me if no one else.....) I have attached a screenshot of what I understand would be the calls to be made (the green line is the 20 sma Please let me know if I understand you correctly or have totally lost the plot!! cheers guy BZ for all your help so far BTW

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Nope, your entering on the first 20sma cross, the 60min market direction is still down, so although it worked in all those cases better, still technically a counter trend trade so higher risk. I think, I'll crunch some 20sma cross numbers shortly, but don't think it would work as well, much higher loss rate. Chart same time as yours details the S / B / X points!!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You need the 2 lines 55 and 65 sma, look up to the left of the boobies I drew on market stayed within so hold the trade gives abit of a chop buffer zone. Minimizing trades from chop is KEY!!

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Here you go, F marks the place you'd of gotten in on just a 20sma cross which failed, 5 fails there, sticking to the system would get you 0 fails. 20sma cross, might be better for trading Chop but no, markets rarely chopping these days. Prefer less profit and safer trades. But 20sma cross is still better than just guessing In super chop you can just trade the 8sma chop but there all going to be counter trend.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Attachment failed above I see!!

There is need for a good ea for this system to avoid staying glue to the PC 24 hrs.That will be too stressful.We need a good programmer to do this for us.My little opinion.Hope my expression is not completely stupid.Well if I sound stupid I am not bothered at all.After all the thread is for the stupid that hate loosing there money to the S.M

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Your in luck, I'm a top of the line programmer although not EA's, not written 1 in 4years for the old Ver 3 Meta. Thinking about EA, exit rules are a pain as there is some discression in that, and need it to only trade certain high probability time zones to avoid chop and no new trade 1hour before big news ( you'll have to tell it the time ) as it's generally chop due to fear. I'll try to get a EA done Monday / Tuesday when the markets moving, that will let you know audibly any time the market crosses to a Long or Short entry position, to save my eyes. Then I'll build on it from there, exit logic, then back test data to determine best times then easy life

--- 帖子 #177 ---
This is starting to look more and more like the Ichimoku Cloud indicator!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Just checked that, nahhhh it's crap. Would like something i could put 2 SMA's into and it would fill in the dead zone, I can program auto traders but never got my head around indicators so I'm not even going to try!! Anyone ??

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I've added a screenshot that has some of my ideas of conditions I'm looking for. 1) Bounce off the Bollinger Band 2) 3/20 cross then the exit conditions can be either: 1) 3/8 cross OR 2) Bollinger Band bounce Not sure if that would increase the effectiveness of the method (or indeed the simplicity of coding it as an EA). However, In terms of simplicity it will have very clear rules I've left in the 55,65 ema on the graphs, but in terms of entry / exit points it is pretty redundant in this configuration. I'm not sure how easy / difficult it is to determine a bounce off the bollinger (I suspect lower close on upper bolinger, higher close on lower bollinger) and obviously I don't expect ANY system to be 100%, but will be interesting to see exactly how much of the moves it WOULD catch!!!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
That don't work, don't trade the BB range it's ever changing, it makes you try to pick tops and bottoms all counter trend, which is a fools game, after the fact it looks easy peasy thats why everyone thinks it's good and everyone tries to catch tops and bottoms, in reality 80% of them are going to turn against you and the ones that don't aren't worth many pips ( yes I tried to trade this way for AGES and blew the account loads of times ) Stick to my plan dude, put your greed in check it's safer and making alot of nice easy peasy pips, just scale the lot size up quickly as your account grows for big profits

--- 帖子 #181 ---
My systems got clearly defined exits aswell, normally small ones, with counter trend you'll end up holding for ever, waiting for that turn which you think is always about to happen and it never does Counter trade = DEAD account, SERIOUSLY!!!!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
OK, These seems not just choppy but gale force!!! I've tried to manually pick out all the entries or exits manually from the above entry exit conditions. (So bear with me if I missed any!) To be honest I cannot see that many losses (if someone want to manually check the times displayed are BST +1 hr (for some reason I have yet to determine). In fact I would argue assuming you were disciplined and exited as soon as you could after the candle closed down, then I suspect all in all you would have made it through the chop in profit, however I'm biased and would say that! Certainly assuming a 15 pip SL and a 3 pip spread (typical for "normal" hours FXCM ) you would have picked up the first entry as a buy, and would have stayed in all the way through the chop! Yep it would have been a long trade for this system, but it would have ultimately succeeded and there were a number of profitable places you could have got out of the trade early when you realised it was choppy!!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
3/20 signal on it's own will suffer from wayyyyy to much chop, I've already tested that tonight and done the maths, everyones been trying to do that for AGES. You NEED the direction strength of the 60sma on your side and the area inbetween to filter out chop. Yes it looks really nice on that chart, but test a few days worth of charts you'll see what I mean!!

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Yes I'll give you it's better for directionless chop, mines better for trend but trend is where the money is at and trading live it's near impossible to tell if the next 10mins will be trend or chop sadly. And it's how visible it looks live to, I find my 20/55.65 cross easier to see personally. Yes I'm trying to knock the counter trends outta you, which this method will force you down, I trade with the trend I have 23wins in a row, I trade against the trend I have 8 losses and wipe my account, thats how bad counter trend is. Less risk is KEY to sustaining this baby and making it to that golden 10Mil ( lets face it 1Mil is worthless these days LOL )

--- 帖子 #185 ---
TBH I was going to go with your method monday AM anyway!! I cannot fault your logic as it looks what I would call a safer pair of hands (I fully appreciate mine is more simplistic - but hey look what thread I'm putting this on!!!) would be cool if you can (and once again apologies if this has ALREADY been done many times before) The last template I posted I think covers all the required info, however, would be fantastic if you could double check and perhaps upload the FINAL FINAL template for this method, then I can install it on MT4, then migrate across to FXCM (so envelope is useless to me !!) I really apreciate the affort ( and at times patience!!) you are showing matey Once again BZ P.S. As you are relatively close by - when I've made my first £10K with this system I'll buy you a round if you like (Would do it at £1K - but hey not made of money LOL!!!) Anyway = way past my bedtime so TOODLES!!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Already compared your chart to mine, it's spot on, we are all trading on the same page!! Just trade off the MT4 chart. remember your only 40miles away, mines a coke though!!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
EJ last week trending times for GMT!! Actually forget that, very little chop all day, huge swings and huge profits made from the look of it, very few losers ( only a quick scan through ) Ofcourse last Monday is irrelevant to this Monday so no guarantees, but certaintly doesn't rule Mondays out for trend

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Spent most of my Saturday night( what fun ), testing other SMA Values and :- For the 20sma, I've tried 15sma too fast, 25sma too slow, getting the best profits over all from a 20sma setting, 22 might be SLIGHTLY better sometimes, but splitting hairs so unless we get chopped too much 20sma stays. Same for the 55/65's perfect balance and not to big a dead zone SL wise maybe most of the time, although 40,50 looks promising too, just slightly quicker 15mins. Also I used to use 120sma and 240sma, and yes they work on a fair few locations enough not to be coincidence, but there not consistent enough break / not breaking wise to add the complexity, which was what was killing me ( and being stupid ), before dumping them. Interesting!! So close yet so far away for YEARS!!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Ran the numbers vaguely in my head for just 3ema / 20sma crosses. It's not bad in ways, it turns some losers into winners, but makes its own losers and fairly frequently I think more so, but at the same time, better prices on entry and more trades so more losers are expected anyway. But it's 2am and surely it can't be that easy just to trade 3ema / 20ema cross overs till the cows come home, can it ??? ARRRGGHHHHH I DUNNO will sleep on it, but that really is a KISS system hey Okay 2 demo accounts Monday ran side by side, 1 20 and 55/65 rules and 1 just 20 rule!! Lets have a trade off!!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi TD You can try use the attached indicator to get the 2 SMA's fill. I did use it on my chart. Good to spot on No Man Land area. ~profi~

--- 帖子 #191 ---
psgm When you say the trades should be obvious, do you mean when there is a big reversal candle after a discrenable direction in the direction of 1 minute chart it is a signal? Or when there are several consecutive bullish or bearish candles and then there is a reversal candle is it a signal?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Apologies just got your email, and now I shall try and answer your question. The answer - is Yes - to both!!! Please let me explain. There are times when yes just one large candle will be indicitave of a trade, and also 2-3 consecutive candles are a trade. What I was trying to get across is this. When you look at a chart, without any other information your eye is able to see when the price has changed direction correct? (you can tell it has HAPPENED at the very least!!) OK now what i was trying to convey, is that there are certain patterns that occur when this happens. Without going into specifics of candlestick formations, if you study any chart, and enough of them (weekends are good as they don't update - so good for study!) Then you can picture in your head certain repeating patterns. Ok, since this thread has began, with lots of great advice, that has been refined slightly, by noticing that by use of the bollinger band, and 2-3 moving averages it is possible to refine better when a turn may be occuring. If you look at my simplified entry exit strategy, you can hopefully see what I mean. (I have included screenshots to help!) I have stated using the 3/20 cross as entry point, however also 3/8 cross also seems to work reasonably well. As I have stated on this thread, my friend who had never traded before friday, followed this strategy on a demo account Friday, and on his very first day made over 100 pips with no losses. Of course 1 day may have been a fluke, but if nothing else it gets my attention!

TD If you think just using 3/20 and Bollinger bounce would be frustratingly simple as entry points - well 3/20 was used as further confirmation!!! 3/8 is the initial cross, and 3/20 was used as to confirm the trade!! Is there anyone out there prepared/ stupid enough to have a look at his over a chart? Bear in mind SL would be 15 pips (Inclusive of a 3pip spread for me) Again this "mechanical" version of trying to determine "OBVIOUS" signals has not been put to serioius live testing as far as I know, however backtesting shows extreme promise!! to clarify, ENTRY .... 1) Bollinger "bounce" occured 2) 3/8 cross EXIT Can be any of these (depending on your risk appetite / confidence of move 1) Bollinger band Bounce (opposite side to entry) 2) 3/8 cross 3) SL 15 hit Once again please refer to my charts to probably explain itr better than I just did!! For me, when I have been manually trading this, once a trade has gone over 10 pips (ideally 15 pips), I set the SL, so it will be 10 pips profit regardless, place a trailing stop of 10 pips (min for FXCM) then I can move on to another trade / currency. Yes this does not follow the mechanics of this sytem, and I may stop it when I have extensively tested this system. However up until now I was looking for 10-15 pips per trade, and old habits die hard!!! Hopefully now I have seen the error of my ways!!!

Use the BB to exit not to buy is the advice, I might put the BB back on then, The 38 was to fast, way to many reversals. I'm going to slow the 20sma off to 22sma it just back fits every so slightly better ( keep up ) I'll setup 2 MT4 chart platforms, open 2 demo fxcm accounts, 1 per screen and take every signal live, try to get a couple of hours to just do this ( BORED already ), then I can compare the trade data, see if either really even work and which 1 works best. EJ only trading 2 systems at once will be confusing enough. I think the 55/65 ( might use the 40/50 for the 3/20 cross ) will still be usefull info, if long and price stalling under exit on a 3/8 cross back down, IF crossed over then might consider holding till it breaks back under to ride out the longer bigger pip trades. INTERESTING for sure, good bit of team work going on here, I wouldn't of even checked it. Thanks for the EA's gives me something to get started and Modify to suite maybe

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Just noticed (why didn't I think of this before!!!) The bollinger band on MT4, also automatically incorporates the 20sma!!! 22 could indeed work better, but if the bollinger band is included ANYWAY, one less indicator for the template!!!

--- 帖子 #197 ---
The Bollinger band is included, as I said, if a "bounce" has already occured, then there is already some momentum for the move!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
PSGM Do your MA crossovers in this trading system work only as confirmation and filter not the signals themselves? As MA crossovers based systems have bad reputation hehind them. Thank you for your posts.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I would say that yes the MA is confirmation, but I would suggest that the whole of the information is used to determine the trade. Using the "bounce" of the bollinger band in itself isn't good enough, similarly the 3/8 cross isn't good enough But together could have a lot of potential. I wouldn't like to say what the success rate is (As I haven't tested for a long enough time). As with any system, the key is to get one that works for you. This particular method has effectively evolved through this thread, so hopefully you can see the logic behind the use of every detail and why it has been included or removed. I keep saying this, that the system may not be the most profitable available (only time will tell), however I am striving to stick to the KISS philosophy at all times. It is so so simple to add additional indicators to add further information - but in my opinion they are all lagging and so have disadvantages. For me this is a method that uses the minimum additions, and signals can be followed with the minimum of confusion. I hope people are finding this useful and help improve their trading.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
OK this is where the thread has evolved to so far !!!

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Already dumped the 55,65 I see in the hope it's not needed, thats definately KISS Mate Honestly trust me on this, dump the BB range, I've been trying to use them for years and they keep costing me And 2 less lines

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I'll do some back testing and thinking in a while, then I guess do some demo test trades, both systems unsure on the just 22sma cross, seems to simple, I prefer 2 sets of market direction to trade off. But the market isn't like it was 4years ago when I started, much more volatile so if we can milk it easily for the time being then milk it we shall

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Okay, when awake and thinking properly well ish :- You've got to keep to both SMA rules and the No trade zone sorry!! Waiting for the 55/65 range cross over isn't perfect, but it reduces the chop trades by @70% from the look of it and keeps you in other trades which work out better than having to flip sides twice. The average pips profit per trade seems to be @50% better to, but there are less trades. Without the 55/65 it's also too noisy you'll be in and out of trades all the time. Keep your greed in check and lets keep our heads.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi psgm and Turveyd I have been on the M1 for a while using this. 9,21 and 34 ema for immediate change as per your 3/8 xover. 200ema for overall longer view and 105 ema to represent the M5 21ema. Double cci with sma crossover. When that sets up it needs to clear +/- 100 to confirm the move as valid. I have tried all the shorter ma's and find this suits me. If any of it helps let me know or shout if you want it deleted. I know its not totally simple but about as naked as I have been. Check this out on m1 audusd on friday afternoon. I traded this all the way up on the 34ema while having fun with The fxtradewin with turveyd. Andypips

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Yo Andy, Scammers hey got to hate the suckers!! Not a million miles off what I'm working on here, so the question is, are you making the elusive $$$'s ?? Just tried EMA's rather than SMA's, never liked SMA, but 21ema is classic outta the big boy rules. delete ? nope keep it coming!!

--- 帖子 #206 ---
OKay your all going to HATE Me, just to add extra confusion :- 20SMA to 22SMA incase anyones missed it. I was thinking about the 55/65 band wrong yesterday, it's a anti chop band and still had some bad chop on the charts, so the bigger the number ( yes you lose a few pips on some entrys ), but the bigger the no trade zone and the less chop. So to recap :- 3EMA ( Price line trade off this, not the BID, I'd say hide the candles but can't trade like that myself ) 8SMA ( first sign your trades turning against you early on, so EXIT Trigger if you feel the need for caution better small profit than a loss ) 22SMA ( Main trade off line, also major take profit line ) 80 &amp; 90SMA ( treat as 1 big wide SMA, I do not want any trades against this, above = LONGS ONLY , Below = SHORTS ONLY easy as ) NO new trades between the 22sma and 80,90sma Only new trades on the right side of the 22SMA following the 80/90 rule, new trades you can hold into the no trade zone and exit at your discression. Easy enough ?? Lets make some much needed $$$$'s all round I bet!! I'll post up Templates later, after I double think my thinking

--- 帖子 #207 ---
OK I agree there will be a lot less trades, however, if the extra my trades could pick up are not worth the hassle then No probs. So Could you clarify on this chart, where exactly the entry exit points would be. I have 3 ema 8/55/65 sma I have kept bollinger, as I haven't amended my template yet = and the central line is 20 sma anyway. I'm guessing in this instance I would have picked up most of the trades anyway, but will be interesting if we are on the same page!!!

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Dude, read above the bold bits

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi Turveyd I wish my results were big bucks but not yet. Have been at this 3 years now full and part time and finally consistent with the % increase. Only a smallish ac but always an average of 20ish% per week. That will decrease in time as I currently risk up to 5% per trade, usually 2%. With compounding the risk can become less to see the same return. Have blown 3 accounts so far but not funded this one for 6 months now. Most trades on any of the majors or aud etc usually good for 20 pips with this set up. The cci is brilliant for entries- I first came across its use in F4's journal. The exits are either predetermined targets, pivot points,r1,r2,s1,s2 etc or a break of one of the ma's. If its going long and liking the 9 as support then my stop will be the 21 and so on.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yo Andy, very similar plan then. 4 1/2 years here part time very very much so, got to be 2years over the period where I've never even looked at it. Blown the account a few times, but only fund it barely, upto the last blow out 4weeks back I got to 13months without adding So nearly there, then a step back and time out re thinking it, simplifying 20% account growth per week is nice. I'll be risking 13% Wednesday at first, which hopefully will drop to 3% quick sharpish then 2 lots and back to 6% so should get a few account doubles short term, then back it off to @3% per trade area I guess. Keep it up!!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
PSGM, remember trading live is different back testing. That 20sma break on your chart mid way through, account for the lag on the 3ema ( Required to remove chop ) and the spread and a average entry and you'd make @5pips, where as the previous trade going up before it made 15pips. If you change the SMA to 80,90 you'll notice the dip under and the short called which I took a pic and said Short here to would of never of happened

--- 帖子 #212 ---
PSGM Could give us a tip about what sessions are better to trade with your Method please? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I would say the best times to trade are when the spread is at its lowest, so the usual suspects - When there are 2 or more exchanges - so between the london and US sessions. However, there is no real reason why this cannot be used at ANY time

--- 帖子 #214 ---
OK well I shall see what it does in anger tomorrow!!! I suspect looking for a total of 150 - 200 pips should be relatively simple to achieve throughout the day using this method ( I can't believe there wont be 15 10 pip trades tomorrow - I suspect that would be an exceptionally quiet day if it was!)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Markets have opened on FXCM

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Times, stick to trending times :- All GMT. 9:30am - 11:30am. 2:30pm - 4:30pm 00:30am - 02:00am Those are my times!!

--- 帖子 #217 ---
No MT4 charts till 11pm I think, then a while for the SMA's to settle we'll see how late i'm up. Monday's demoing, could suggest if trading full time and getting RICH is likely or not, should be interesting!!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
The systems in demo account profit baby YEAH!!! 4.2pips LOL the GU short trade call got @30pips though!!

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi, just to double clarify = are those gmt or london time? since ure in the midlands!! Thanks Pardy

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Will be interesting to see what TD got on his overnight session! 4.2 pips - there was a good 50 pip+ move he should have been able to catch on ej (certainly most of it would have been caught on the bollinger bounce 3/8 method) At least that is how it appears from backtesting - will just have to see his final totals

--- 帖子 #221 ---
TD, Thanks for sharing your system! Questions: Sorry...but I am confused... (1) Is the valid crossover 3EMA/22SMA? Or is it 3EMA/8SMA? Entry made at that point? Only long trades with price above the no-trade zone, and only sell trades with price below the no-trade zone? (2) Do you wait for the 1 minute candle to close before making a trade entry? Or do you place your trade immediately when the crossover occurs? (3) Would adding the ADX indicator with a threshold signal of 25 or more indicating a trending market help keep us out of the chop? (4) Best trading times London and New York sessions? Good Trading! Bob in Wisconsin

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Anyone catch this on EU ?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
OK, Here is a template that isolates the moving averages from the candles!! 3 ema 8 sma 22 sma 80 sma 90 sma I believe that is the setup!!!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Since francfort open 3 demo trades, total 41 pips with the trend 1H ! Not bad Sorry for the chart atm maybe later Luk

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Excellent work Pips. Just to confirm what are you using as your triggers for the trades?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
OK first LIVE trade under the new regime... "Shorts under 80/90. Long above. 3ema entry 20 sma exit" EJ Time in 0934 Time out 0938 Profit +15 pips Lot size 0.2 Total Profit £20.35 ( I went for a TP of 15 pips!) Not sure if to stick to fixed TP, OR run with the method. I am LIVE with this and 1st time of using Any thoughts guys???

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Trade using the bollinger bounce 3/8 3/20 method Buy EJ This is NOT waiting for the 80/90 cross - Not trading live - just see how it pans out

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Time is 0959 Mon 11 May 2009 The buy trade would have already exceeded my 15 pip TP!!!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
psgm Adding to what you said in your first post we would add the entry and exit conditions that you later said. Right?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hello PSGM the same set-up as the new regime and i look at 1H trend when i put the trigger on 1M with 3 and 8 ma and about 20 stop loss with some feeling and some others idicators learned from the MP thread but i don t want to confuse people here, because it s suppose to keep it simple here ! So I will continue to practice this interesting system just to get more confidence ! Luk

Entered EJ 10:08 exited 10:24 (Had reset my stop loss to +40.7 pips) and got stopped out! Profit trade 2 40.1 (0.6 FXCM pip slippage 8-( ) £54.36 Total TRADING PROFIT £74.71

--- 帖子 #232 ---
My lack of faith is disturbing!!!! 3rd trade moved into profit was unsure, so moved the stop loss to +2.8. stopped out at +2.7 pips 10:49 entry 10:51 Exit

PSGM you've got to let them ride, although no doubt I'll be wussing out early wedneday to Pips and PSGM profits, this is looking GOOD

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I have been enjoying this thread. I quite like TurveyD's 3EMA and 6MA crossover signals. For general Trend I have been using Raghee Horner's 34EMA "wave" (3 EMAs on High, Low close), and also Trend Magic (or Magic Trend?) -- both probably here at the factory. They are free on the net. And of course basic candlestick analysis in conjunction with the indicators. Hope you don't mind a picture of my KISS Thanks again for this thread Edit: Here are Raghee Horner's GRaB indicators (colored candles and wave) [link wasn't working right on her blog, so I attached them] Here is TrendMagic http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...hmentid=238570 (I fixed this link)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Just made a buy entry at 11:25 SL 15 ABOVE 80/90 3 crossed above the 20 Could I have avoided this loss? (other than simply not trading) I presume I either pulled the trigger too early or too late. Or am I simply too eager to see the signals!! Help appreciated

--- 帖子 #236 ---
EJ was choppy, no way to know in advance, its only 1 loss, just got to decide if taking the trade is worth the risk or not, sit it out wait for some better market action. 11:30am GMT the market really does seem to go into slow mode.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
been following this thread. i've been personally looking for my system too, with the basic criteria of simplicity. this is looking beautiful. a couple of questions: i normally see you trade EJ. can this work ok with EU or any other pair? also, how about other TFs? thanks and keep it up, guys.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Any timeframe any pair In my opinion if you have to rely on being 1hr candles or daily, then you are relying on the probability of the move in your direction. ANY system should be generic in terms of currency or timeframe (after all doesn't a daily chart look like a 1 min chart if you remove reference points to price and time!!! I've used this system in "anger" today. Any losses were made through either. 1) Operator error 2) Tight ranging periods (and arguably Operator Error) Overall I made a profit today of with a win ratio of 60-70%. On 5 trades I made over 100 pips, including 1 trade 40 pips! I made 2 trades under 5 pips profit, and this was because I am a relative newbie to trading and made the rookie mistake of closing the stop loss to just over profit ASAP. Yes I made mistakes today, and could have easily made another 100 - 200 pips (this is ALL on eur/jpy) But for a first day of trading this method, I think the results speak for themselves!! BTW I was using the Bollinger bounce 3/8 cross. I was using 3/20 cross, my friend was using the 3/8 cross after a bollinger bounce. My friend made 90% of his trades! most of my losses were during the choppy period (between 11:30 and 14:30) Guess I will not be trading that time again! The only reason I did was I wanted to give this method as hard a test as possible, to see if I was correct!

--- 帖子 #239 ---
OK this was by biggest win of the day (40 pips). It was 40 pips, because it reached 45 pips, and by that point I was more than happy with the result! Possibly could have reached 50 pips, and certainly did not follow the mechanical exit rules, but I don't think the mechanical exit rules would have yielded many more pips! Note there had been a "bounce" off the upper bollinger line, followed by 3 down candles (3 black crom formation?) as well as a 3/8 cross and indeed a 3/20 cross. To me that spelt SELL SELL SELL !!!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I used to use the high low close thingy to generate a range to filter out inaccuracy to, I must admit I do like that ( Warning change alert ) Thanks, will check your indicators in abit, never know 1 of them someday might mean something to me!! thanks

--- 帖子 #241 ---
PGSM 60-70% win rate without trying to not trade chop is about what I'm aiming for, after 80% with chop removed. Your mate got 90% just trading 3/8, NICE, but market is really swingy today normal more mixed day he likely wouldn't of faired so well, plus thats too quick, too many trades for my old brain. +100 pips if you can keep doing it will get you from £200 to the Mil in 18months do me Where you using the 85-90sma to filter chop or not ??

--- 帖子 #242 ---
[quote=psgm;2725932] I made 2 trades under 5 pips profit, and this was because I am a relative newbie to trading and made the rookie mistake of closing the stop loss to just over profit ASAP. (CUT) most of my losses were during the choppy period (between 11:30 and 14:30) Guess I will not be trading that time again!/quote] Hope you don't mind me saying, but that may not always be the choppy period though; some days there are big US news announcements at 1330 which can cause big moves, sometimes though less often also at 1400 or 1415. I think the official open of New York forex trading is 1300 - that sometimes sees a few sparks begin to fly. So looking at an economic calendar and knowing what is coming is a good idea. NB Some calendars do not list the Weds. 1530 announcement of USA oil stocks which can have a big effect on oil price, and spinoff effects sometimes on other instruments that are correlated at the time. I looked at some charts with your template on during the day, while I was losing money with ill-considered trades elsewhere - I wish I had taken the time to test your system for real money instead! Thanks for your effort.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
[quote=paulb;2726092] The ranges we are making the pips on die off, first 2-3 hours of the UK Open then USA open 2:30-5:30 are definately in general safer for this, not saying its the same every day ofcourse but 2 - 3 hours then a long break, then 2 - 3 hours more trading sounds perfect to me Then maybe 1hour for the Asian session later if up.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
TF wise, although it works okay ish on M5 this is working off intraday strength the longer the time frame the less it'll pick this up, so M1 or M5 only I think, M15 looked useless, strangely D1 looked good if you don't mind 2month holds. Might need better optomising for M5 and above also.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I Had mine configured for the 80/90 I tried going for sells under the 80/90, longs Over - to mixed results. (but I would say it was more down to user rather than system!) I got most joy from the bounce 3/8 cross method. 3/20 got me into the "choppy" trades a little late, so made loses, when could have made profits! (As I said I linked up with a friend, he traded bounce 3/8, I traded bounce 3/20) On one occassion he made a profit, when I got stopped out!! I can see the merit of the 80,90, but defo bollinger band brings a certain something to the party. I do not rely on the bounce alone (that way madness lies), but combine that with your strategy, there are serious pips to be made. I will say that the stronger the bounce, the stronger the signal.! If nothing else, it compares very favourably to simply backtesting the charts. Just got to iron out operator error now to earn some serious pips!!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
The 80/90 works better to stop fakes being triggered, when the market is trending, it'll save alot of pips there. Yes during chop the faster 1's can be better, but I'm trying to avoid chop, less trades, more winners, less busy and less stress is key to me. but many ways to skin a cat or something like that.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I have only tested this method on Forex, would be interesting how it holds up on others (i.e stocks futures, cfds, commodities etc). i can / do only trade spot forex, so if you guys can mangle the template to others would be interesting to see results! Today, my most effective rules were.... 1) bollinger bounce 2) 3/8 cross

--- 帖子 #248 ---
SYSTEM CHANGE !!! lol Drop the 80/90SMA, set it at 90SMA HIGH and 90SMA LOW that gives a neater area with fixed pips, I prefer!!!

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I'm sticking with my 90min and 20min SMA trend system, no trades against. I fear alot of very small profits against the longer trend which will reverse in a instant and cost you dear over time, okay it worked today but not for me. I can see times where a 3/8 or 3/22 could be used safely on it's own but then the KISS system stops becoming so simple. I'll have a play around with the 22 on the chart briefly and see if it can be made abit quicker to get you in cheaper, without suffering much worse from chop. BRB ish!!

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Okay RETHINK no. 4073 on the basis no ones using my 80/90 rules, I WANT MY DUMMY, MOMMY MOMMY!!!!!! the 80/90 rule really does waste more pips than well anything on 90mins trend time reversal zones, HUGE wasteful POS!! Okay same EXACT rules, but 80/90 goes out the window, replace it with a solitary 40sma with the biggest fattest and as bright as you can get. So 3EMA 8SMA 20SMA 40SMA KISS enough baby ??? Still gets you all a longer trend to work with and still eliminates chop to a degree with the no trade zone between 20 &amp; 40. Confused ?? you wait to change 4074.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Better get some Demo time in, back Live Wednesday Long EJ called, in 132.30, just took 132.47 + 17 NICE 40sma is going to produce alot more trades, it just filters out :- Market is going down say. 3ema jumps back over the 20sma, you flip long, 2mins later it's back up, you've flipped back short or worse still you've left the long on outta frustration and -15SL hit 2mins later. It gives a it's over 20, wait wait wait, it's back under short saving a wasteful long trade quite a few times. MUST STOP MAKING CHANGES LOL

--- 帖子 #252 ---
[quote=paulb;2726092] Paul, I try to avoid news, all happens too quickly a 15SL is hit as it chops for that or the spread goes to 15 for a few seconds to take everyone out. Definately check the news each date and take note of any news that falls out side of the normal time slot. Okay we are running 15-20SL's, so a new hit isn't the end of the world. Good luck with the ever evolving system Paul, let us know if your trading and profiting and if not find us a solution please

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Probably a good idea. Put your kiss temp next to THV and am watching it along with fartin' around with trade simulator - I'll keep ya updated if and when I get some hard results - good or bad. Playin' around on both e/u and e/j -

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Keep me posted Seereye, I still think this some common sense behind it, it's better the shooting blind though which fixes 1/2 of the battle and still being Simple enough for anyone to understand. EU and EJ!!

GU also updated. I also use something to highlight the 50's and 00's and makes the BID on the MT4 chart easier to see also attached.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi, just came across. Do you have any idea about a long-term performace of this strategy? I mean, do you have some backtest results for say 3-4 years history? If yes, post it here. Looking forward. -pt-

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Nope sorry, it's new and hot off the press for you lot to try for me I looked back maybe 2weeks on the EJ chart without any attempt to filter chop time or anything else wise, just all trades. Reckon it'll win 70% of the time over all, average lose 10-12 if your not lazy and just let your SL hit. Sometimes it gets @130pips ( okay thats optimal ) looking like a average profit 22-24 area so nearly 100% on the losers. Market drops back to the forgotten about low volatility of time time last year before the big drops and it'll likely chop to much and fail, but until then

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I see. If I find some time, I'll give it a try in ForexTester and post someresults here. tc -pt-

--- 帖子 #259 ---
If that'll let you do it, only trade GMT 9:30-11:30, 14:30-17:30 00:30-02:00 and compare please. As as I said, not 100% mechanical but it'll be good to see if the basis has merit or not. thanks

Hi Turvey D I am just looking at your times of trade, are those hours for when BST is in effect. Are you trading from 30 mins after UK opens and for 2 hours after that. For Jpy is that 30 mins after Jpy open and then for 1 hour after that thanks

--- 帖子 #262 ---
The Jpy start time would be 27mins away ish from this post, if that helps. We are in BST at the moment so I guess there all BST Times.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
how is the system doing, what is the PIP count thus far??

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi Turvey D That is 30 mins before the open of Japan. OK, it does get going then and for open and then about 60 mins Will have a look

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Well there is no losing trades so far Ofcourse I've only made 2, +4 +9, the systems changed abit, more of a scalper recently. Start trading Wednesday all being well.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Has anybody else tried just using the bollinger bounce, then 3/8 cross with 15 pip s/l? Admittedly only limited testing, but should pick up mop most of the price movements in a day. You are going to have to make a lot more trades than with using to 40 sma, but surely that is the essence of scalping! I will try and use a combination of Bounce 3/8 moves and using the 40 SMA today, (perhaps using the 40 sma as a bounce as well as the Bollinger, fill get me more of the big moves, whilst illiminating sitting on a retrace (see attached to try to explain this....) Basically I use the initial Bollinger bounce as my first order, then (depending on risk appetite) close out when a retracement at the bollinger, or at the 3/8 cross. In this instance the price has continued through the 40 sma, so going with the trend I will be looking for buys. The price then bounces off the 40 sma, so I am now looking for a 3/8 cross. Again I stay in until the bollinger bounce and wait for a retracement. This time it bounces off the 20 sma provided by the bollinger . Remember the initial concept of this thread if you see an obvious trade, then it probably is! Note a bounce off the bollinger. A bounce off the 40 SMA, a bounce off the 20 SMA Ever heard these before???????? At the moment this is very much a manual system, hence the need for the most important indicator of all - the mark one eyeball!!! Trust your spider senses people.

When a signal is developing in higher timeframe is it correct that I go to a lower timeframe and if I see the same signal there at that moment I entry in the lower. Is it a correct way?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I only trade single TF being M1 with a M5 chart to give me a better days over view, I fear over complicated using multiple TF's. 20SMA speeded up to 15sma ( PG don't use 15 for your X's on there own ), 15 on trend moves is too fast the market dips below giving a perfect 2nd entry signal when 2mins later is moves back above, only use at 15 if your using the 40sma no trade zone!!!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Just saw there was a move from 0800 this morning EJ Perfect storm of pretty much all indicators cerossing at once and just after a bounce I was waiting til 9:00 am, so didn't trade - but it was just over 100pips!!!! I'm sold on this!!! (but hey I'm biased!!!) Arguably my method would have picked it up at 0730 for an extra 10 pips, but there was 30 mins of chop - you pays your money you takes your choice!!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
OK I can see the 40 will not pick up as many trades as mine, but it will most definitely not be as bumpy a ride!!! Question is - is the bumpiness worth it??? So just to be clear with your 40 Sma, am I looking for the 3 to cross the 40?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
With the 20 changed to 15, it signalled 3 entrys on the trend move ie safe places to get in, if your late for the party, which I normally am. EU broke down, I shorted to test it,, risky after a trend move but holding up well and going my way EJ just broke down to, shorting will see how strong this is I guess

--- 帖子 #272 ---
3 ema has just broken through 22 and 40 sma Lets see how this one plays.... My entry time 0940 BST 12 May 2009 SL 15 pips

--- 帖子 #273 ---
These are the moves, I'm optomizing the system to gun for I don't mind making 20pips here and there, but nail the occasional 100+ pip move and it'll sure give your account a huge boost If all my other trades break even at the end of the day and it's only the 100+ plays that I hold onto, my account will still be doing well. Got to be in it to win it, if your in it for free effectively, then the 100+ers become the wins

--- 帖子 #274 ---
What's the exit strategy? I waited for the 3 to cross the 40 and just got stung 8-(

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Went okay, both trades got to +10 area, just watching on vnc so too lazy to press exit on a demo. EU then turned up for a 20pip profit so far to. Slow day though, normal expected after big move chop though. Put a dotted 120sma on the charts, just to remind me longer term trend is still up, not really trading off it, but might use it for S/R for Exit point, worked well on EU.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Exits depend on the strength of the move, weak move 3/8 get outta dodge, moderate move risk to 15sma these days, strong move like the 100pipper risk out to the 40 ( these will be rare but nice ) GU made 60pips or something, off a fresh buy signal earlier, 3/8 nearly held on all the way up, 3/15 held all the way up thats an example of moving to the next level. Trail with loose stops if you want, I'll try to keep my stop under the 40sma to keep my loss minimised if nothing else.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
The 40sma is working really well today isn't it, not to fast keeps you in the longer trades, while at the same time quick enough to not waste huge pips on trend changes. Give it a 9/10 I think, it's near perfect. The 15sma works abit better with the 40sma aswell. so final change I think, got to lock it down before going live tommorow. 3ema 8sma 15sma 40sma easy!!!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Guys! I have checked the system and it is quite interesting for small quick trades with little risk. As these trades come and go very quickly, its diffilcult to to see some of the best setups live...... so I would like to ask TD or PS if they are available on messenger or skype to exchange information live as they happens. Thanks for a simple yet efficient system

--- 帖子 #279 ---
FXCasper, A Free live chat room, with chat kept to a min just trade talk while the good times are on, would be perfect. Loads could join and just watch and pick out the plays they want then. MSN might do it, all in 1 chat window if there aren't to many. Anyone got any ideas for FREE Chat room, FREE is essential!!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi, I guess there are lots of options available. Now that we have established an interest, I am sure we can find a suitable and free option that will work pretty good. Gonna have a look around

--- 帖子 #281 ---
The new setup with the 40 seems to be working very well indeed. In fact, its good from frankfurt session. Regards Pardy

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Shame they dropped the chat rooms from the yahoo clubs. As I plan to longer term, trade EJ, EU and GU possibly all the same time, it's going to be alot of trades and require some nifty mouse clicking skills Thinking, make 300-400 pips per day

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Cool, not seeing any room for improvement here to be honest, have you moved to the 15sma rather than 20/22 yet ??? I'm prefering that too ( both on my charts to compare live ) EJ's about to signal a exit for +35 15 on eu and gu, gu's trying to signal long soon maybe.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Yes, moved to 15, like it better.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Cool Notice the 40sma stopped a long being called against the trend just on the EJ Perfectly, which then signalled a down move on the break back below the 15sma, which likely just got 15pips. Likewise on EU. The chop / anti trend filter is working well at this setting Role on live tommorow ( expect this to fail miserably tomorrow people LOL )

--- 帖子 #286 ---
hello turveyd, look at that screen attached,just happend in GU. how do u detect that sort of chop zone ? i got in twice and got stopped out -15p.i entered every time the 3sma broke 15/40. when the PA finally started rising, i wasnt in because i didnt know how long the chop zone lasts ... how do u trade that?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Guys the best way to have a live room for discussing your method further and to let each other know of potential trades forming with chat kept to a minimal seems like a good idea...Best place is to do this on Skype.... Skype chat rooms are easy, nice simple user interface, friendly to use. The best free way to go for sure, beats msn and yahoo. For those of you who dont have Skype installed the latest version of skype doesn't support the chat rooms anymore, you need Skype v3.8.0.188 which you can google and download either from filehippo or oldapps website. If you need any help, just let me know. Wish you all the best with getting your KISS method to work properly.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
sadly you've kinda got to take the trades, cause you don't know which 1 is suddenly going to make you 40pips, BUT.............. IF it looks weak BAIL to be sure, if it looks weak bail on the 3/8 failing don't let it get as far as your SL, you'd of likely 1/2'd your loss doing so ?? 20pips saved, all helps. I'd be trying to call chop and this is the CHOP time zone so after the first chop give abit more patience on the others maybe. Chop is always the enemy sadly.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Thanks, certainly a option, consider this delegated for the time being ?? Go on lads, sort it out !!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
thanks turveyd, will try to get out sooner in future trades. perhaps theres a good (time based?) chop-zone-detect-indicator out there, that will help improving your system. do you plan to program an EA for your system ?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I'm only planning to trade something like, GMT / BST 09:30 - 11:30 , 14:30 - 15:30 , 00:30 - 02:00 as they suffer less from chop. EA maybe, there is abit of discression on which trades to take and definately on the exits which is hard to teach a EA. I plan to make a alert system soon though, for moves either side outta the no trade zone to give us a wake up call.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
hi tex, the higher period MAs sometimes tell u to stay out. when u c them r in a flat or horizontal manner. or sticks together with other lines then maybe it's best 2 stay out. the market is clueless at this moment. 1m traders like us has 2 b very selective about trades. can't take all of them. best 2 sit back n observe the market. can't be greedy also. u gotta judge when u will let your position run a bit n sometimes get out. even if only 4 a few pips. sometimes when i'm confident about my entry n prices go against me. then i'll average 1 or 2 positions but if prices r not coming back. then l'll run.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
This is not totally mechanical, although it looks like it will make a profit it's better to be selective. the 50 and 00 sweetspots are key aswell, there working well, GU bounced off the 1.5350 and back to 1.5300 for instance just. Not suggesting any other lines though, these work as there so popular. EJ hit 133.00 aswell and reversed so exit near and hold off going long to near. Thats why a chat room with us all on EXACTLY the same system would be ideal, we can point out things to consider that others might of missed. Keep it :- EJ Res 1.3300 News Moderate 10mins EJ broke down EJ Short EJ weak EJ TP Quick and unobtrusive, then outta trade times, chat and chill out and stuff. Then TRADE and all back to topic.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Made a quick chatroom on Skype, read my post on this page if you dont have the right Skype version to join the chat... This is the room link to connect up: http://www.skype.com/go/joinpublicch...N35xbugSsF_mho Sorted?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I agree the sweetspots are excellent S&amp;R areas. Also, the Daily Open Price (set from midnight UK time) and Yesterdays High and Low. All of them show price bouncing off them or moving through them strongly. As for the rest of the fib levels and pivots, I just think they get in the way. Ive seen prices bounce off of S1 and R2 etc, but they don't nearly have the same effect as the ones above. Someone on here said they're as good as randomly generated numbers. Im inclined to agree. Just my opinion. Matt

--- 帖子 #296 ---
psgm Does your proposed system, the last one, work in all timeframes?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Yes, it can never be fully mechanical, and any chop zone detection indicator thingy can only tell you what has already happened, not what will happen next. On the GU chart that Tex posted, with hindsight the best scalping method is possibly to see if the price will turn up or down roughly where it did before, and make an entry there with a tight stop, being prepared to get out quick. If you don't trade the chop zone, then you are looking for a breakout to end it - these can be fake of course! Having some other charts open is useful, which is why I use a demo version of Metatrader - you can see if there is a breakout of GBP against other currencies too, or if everything is zooming up against the USD. Re 50 or 00 sweetspots, I have got slaughtered at these spots many times trying to scalp! GBP/USD for example was hovering around 1.5300 for what seemed like ages this lunchtime and early afternoon. Some small moves, some very wild ones. Theycan be good, but not always!

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Paulb - I think this is an extremely important and imo - crucial for success. That is to have a clean(or fairly clean) candlestick chart next to this template chart with t/l's; s/r's; fibs; 'sweetspots'; candlestick patterns; maybe your favorite indicator or 2 to be able to 'see' the PA on a bigger picture. It was suggested for me to do that so as to learn a scalping 'method' but also to understand PA in general, so as to become an 'intuitive' trader when scalping. Just staring at a 1 minute chart 'waiting for the set-up' without looking at what else is going on - will tend to have traders (like me at one time) to trade chop and get my account creamed. someone above asked how to stay out of chop - well that is one way - have another chart open on a different t/f - to see the bigger picture. It just takes practice, practice, practice. Happy trading all -

--- 帖子 #299 ---
SeerEye What should I see in a higher chart that would indicate there is chop going on in lower?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I agree with SeerEye: to avoid getting eaten by chop with this method I have been looking at the 5 to 15 min time frames to assess good set-ups and fine-tuning entry/exit with the M1. Works more better.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I look at t/f's of 5 min up to the daily. I take a look at Daily range (high's and lows), I take a look at at session high's and lows; I will mark the points (along with others) and keep an eye on them - What I look for; as an example with a 30 min chart, is the recent high low activity; see if it's bouncing between t/l to t/l or support line to resistance line within lets say a 30 pip range - as things consolidate; that range could even get smaller depending on the pair - that's chop; that's what I stay out of -

--- 帖子 #302 ---
You guys are worrying WAYYYYY to much about chop, the system has a element to avoid chop / incorrect trades against the trend and even with all the chop played, which has a exit component before even a 15SL hits, and prefered Time zones. Not to mention the market is so volatile at the moment, there is alot of useable movement, last thursday +394 back tested with taking a stack of chop trades. It's just unlucky when you jump in on a chop section. Sweet spots are only used for Exits, or near 1 that's shown resistance before so dont' take this trade, limited upside.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Come on then everyone post up your profits, looking at the EJ chart you guys should of made a mint off this today. Going Live with this system tommorow ( FXCM allowing ), come on good news only please

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Agreed - just stay oudda da way - lol

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Sorry Turveyd; no profits yet - results (this is just me) in demo are BS. Though, I must say; I will go live with it - aside the THV - next week. I do like THV's entry's a little better(maybe, I'm just a little more conservative); When I have more concrete evidence, I post - though, I honestly DO NOT want to complicate matters on this thread - that is not my intent - you've got something good going on here - don't want to pollute it!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Yep, stick to when your odds are better, focus on the better trading times and have long breaks to relax and chill inbetween. Hey I'm lazy!!!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Come one someone, even if your lying to me, tell me how many 1000's of pips you took today, PLEASE!!! Thanks, thanks thanks!!! i have 100pips, 20SL ish, who's betting on 5 Chop's all hitting SL in a row

Confidence is through the roof high. EJ +15 taken here +29 tonight, Demo!!! The 3ema price noise filter is working well, I'd of bailed a few times before on that short already if not for that, and yes sometimes it'll cost you. EU turned down and GU trying. This works too well, is my ownly issue here, to well for me to believe

--- 帖子 #317 ---
time frame was from this morning my time to current. 11am eastern to now - with a few breaks. Also, I am using (I like the filter better [not so aggressive] - sorry) the earlier version with the 60/55/50sma's - though, I have your current version side by side along with the THV also; comparing notes. Still like the THV entry (maybe that is because, I'm used to it and trust it better; however; to let trade run; I like the bounce off the 20 - that's nice. edit - I hate demo accounts. Going to my small live account to fart around with this -

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I may sound like a complete nutter here, but I was still behaving badly to the candles which are just noise, so this is how I'm trading Just turn the Line colour to black then go to Line mode, can click back to candles in seconds if required!! Lets get back to purely maths and no emotion!!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Not a huge difference and each to there own, then 80,90 attempt was well to slow and nasty in ways. I've changed the 20 to 15, it dips in the moves out more making the trade easier to see, increases the no trade zone abit to, reducing chop. I killed EJ ( I was going to bed to be fair ), 30 pips too early, system didn't signal so +45 here. EU and GU calls are still going the right way. Got any info on your THV ??

I have been scalping tonight, and scalped this morning too. I am up about 120 pips on aboot 8 trades, 2 of them being losers, split evenly across THV and KISS system. There are very important observations I have with these 2 methods on scalping-to be posted l8r. ps- most pips coming from EJ, got to love this pair as a scalper.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Interesting, consider that Plan B, mines abit less noisy on the screen which I like. I better get some sleep, I want to see some profits tomorrow, even if relatively small. I too hate demo account, I don't care so it kinda ruins the entire purpose. Drop a 120sma dotted and small watch for S/R from it to TP, not for entrys.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
NICE I'll look forward to reading your observations in morning mate, so don't forget.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
5 trades, 0 losers + 44pips and I'm just playing around, I've left 50 pips on the table IF I'd stuck to the system 100%. It's not even good market action, it's moderate at best. No Candles scared me the first time I traded like that, but I'm prefering it already, try it, 3ema filter works better!!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I agree as a beginner forex trader you need to stick with mt4 platform, I've demoed FXCM and I'm not impressed try Alpari UK.

Has anyone tried Bollinger Bounce 3/8 cross?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
hey guys, very interesting thread, there seem to have been alot of changes. so again to confirm it is 3ema , 8sma , 15sma , 40sma do we enter on the candle close when the 3ema has crossed through all of them???? thanks in advance andrew

--- 帖子 #328 ---
No trading system wroks against the trend. Is it ture?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Is it a wise decision that we take only the sell trades? being less exposed to the market hazards this way?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
can we have a visual of what u mean?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
hi andrew7, it's the 3 n 8 cross that gives u the entry. if the 3ema cross through the higher MAs. then maybe u can hold your trade 4 a bit longer. as it signifies that the move is strong, price has went through the higher MAs n r continuing going up/down. but u must b alert, as these MAs r floating s/r. also, not all 3/8 crosses r valid. especially when after a up/down trend. price may retrace n 3/8 will cross. but then prices will continue it's previous trend again. seems like turveyd has settled on the above ma settings. but check back 2 c if there's any changes. i'd like 2 mention that trading is discretionary!! what works 4 others may not work 4 u!! as the trader plays a big part in making a system work. thanks

--- 帖子 #332 ---
thanks winningfx, good trading

--- 帖子 #333 ---
hi efiler, in reply 2 your first question. all trading, not only forex depends on prices 2 move 2 turn in a profit. if traders r bullish n buy, then a up trend will form. vice versa for down. all systems created r trying 2 make educated guesses about where the trend will go. trying 2 capture the movement of the trend when they're right n make profits. if u r interested, go 2 the interactive forum n read billyrayvalentine's no brainer trades. it's based on "fade out" of prices when it hits a s/r zone. when prices hits the s/r n bounces off it. that is what i gather from reading abit about it. it's a bit of countertrend n retracements trading. in reply 2 your second question. there r all sorts of traders n some r superstitious. some don't trade on mondays or fridays. some as you mentioned, only sell or buy. while some only trade BOs, trendlines. bottomline, trade what works 4 u!! a system or method that u r comfortable with n can consistently make u profits. a trader cannot trade in conflict within his mind!!! a lot of traders say long term trading off the daily is where the big bucks r. also, bank traders r also trading the daily charts. but if u tried it n you don't like it, what do u do?? keep trading in a way that u don't like. much like working at a job that u don't like. cursing everyday n feel lousy?? how long will u last? that the crux. trading in the lower timeframe maybe seen as scalping by those higher timeframe guys. but if i tried trading higher timeframes n i suck at it. what do u want me 2 do??? where does scalping originate anyway?? from professional floor traders!! thanks

--- 帖子 #334 ---

Hi Guys, Thanks to WilteredFire for opening the KISS chatroom. Where is everybody? Well it has just been a superb time for KISS to collect pips. EU : 50 PIPS EJ : 75 PIPS and the winner is GU : 100 PIPS I guess there were more pips to be collected, but after hours with range and 5 - 7.5 pip collections, I am pretty satisfied with the result so far. Morning European time, we are well above 200 PIPS , and actually no losses so far I would hope that more people could join the chatroom so we can discuss new setups and market conditions. There is always room for improvements. Happy trading everyone

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Drattts over slept missed a good morning. And no it's not a 3/8 cross entry, it's a 3ema is higher than 15sma and 40sma entry, 3/8 on it's own will have you trading against the trend and too much chop. Unless thats what the big winners are using ofcourse, if so over to that ASAP

--- 帖子 #338 ---
As a brit, I was wondering why you're regularly up in the middle of the night.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Stick to Scalping, we are getting 75% win rates from this EASY, profits double the losers to, the higher the TF you trade and time your in the trades the more you are exposed to the random effect and the nearer your trades become 50/50, so although just about possible to eeck a small slow profit thats about all they manage. If you want Long term trading, Forex isn't the tool, move over to Stocks.

I used the 15SMA under it as a no trade zone and held, just filtering out chop, no one can pick entrys too perfectly so allow for room for error, 15-40sma is it That and I don't like to lose

--- 帖子 #359 ---
15sma and 40sma, Long above both, shorts below both easy Exit where ever you like. Patence on the entry and common sense required. I'm 2 wins, 1 loser so far, haven't blown the account BONUS

--- 帖子 #360 ---
With a cherry on top too? Classic. Although I do agree a highlight of the 2 methods on the opening post is a good idea. I think they're still quite different interpretations of looking for an entry. i.e. Candlestick patterns v mechanical MA crossover.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
herein lies a conundrum. if u read this thread from the start, u will read psgm's method. then from 10 over pages onwards psgm n turveyd started 2 discuss. then turveyd shared his method n now people r asking n discussing based on turveyd's method. so i think a little clarification by psgm on his first post is appropriate. thanks

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Thank you for the quick response. Just so I'm sure I understand...above 15 and 40 sma only long...below 15 and 40 sma only short...therefore area between the 15 and 40 is the no trade (chop) zone ? Jim

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Remember my chart is set to line, and my line colour is set to black so nothing on there at all Candle patterns are more trouble than there worth. Although I do flip back to check real lows from time to time

[quote=Turveyd;2731183]15sma and 40sma, Long above both, shorts below both easy Exit where ever you like. Hi TD, Entry taken when the 3/8 cross. Whether long or short depends on the relative position of the 15/40 sma. What happens when one missed the point of crossing of the 3/8 MA? Suggest u emphasis this point as losses will occur when newbies just enter base on the position of the 15/40 sma as point of entry could be when price is turning. Please share with us if you have a means to determine to enter mid way. Cheers

hello turveyd, r u using fxcm US or uk? y r u not using their mt4 platform? hope u will update us with your experience with fxcm. as u know they do not have the best of reputations. good luck with your live trading.

Like all threads on this website - they evolve. Inevitable people were going to put the 4 pennies worth in. If it helps use it - if it doesn't don't!! There comes a point when you have so many visits, the thread takes on a life of its own!! This thread has had nearly 25,000 hits in just over 2 weeks!!! I think it has become self perpetuating!!!!

Broadly, price is moving sideways rather than trending up or down. If the price is ranging fairly regularly and not too jerkily between two roughly similar extremes, but there is a good distance between the extremes, then it may wel be tradeable - but if it is in a naroow range and basically not going anywhere at all, then trading it it is the easiest way to lose lots of money. I am speaking from experience here! - and I keep making the same mistake, often when the price settles down after bigger moves.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
We are in the UK Markets closed and likely USA lunch break time, SLOW Period Move abit more 7pm on, last 2hours of the US markets I guess. Wait for some tradeable action.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Never tried trading through MT4, MT3 was confusing and horrible to place / manage your trades so NOOOOOO!!!!! Experience is generally good, other than losing 2 cheques although they did find the last 1 a week later, I bet the 2nd cheque will go out of my account soon no doubt!! LOL

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Took a chance on EJ being in the short zone with 40sma turning down having a trip down and it DID +15. 4 trades, 1 loser not bad considering I missed the best trading parts of the day. Should as per always held till a exit signal LOL

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Back to break even, missed the good times to trade, then got caught in that EJ dump. Concept is proved just got to master it, just need a normal big range day, rather than this afternoons 1 way trend only pretty much.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Sorry all again :- But until I'm 100% happy changes will happen, change the 40sma to a 50sma, on days like today it's abit less costly being a tad slower!!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi Turveyd Like you I was coming up with a new template day after day. A different ma here or cci instead of rsi there. The next day it would be different values. All this was done in attempt to make the curves fit the market THAT day. The next day the system didn't work because it needed something different again. Since settling for the settings I have now,my consistency has greatly improved. If I get a loss then it is in a ratio of about 4 winners to 1 loser. I have come to realise after 3 years that any template needs at least a week to prove itself based on M5 and M1 trading. Having followed your progress with this set up I have noticed that you are always changing something. This must create a mistrust of the new value for the ma until it has proven itself. Then when it doesn't work once or twice you change it again. The same cycle occurs and without realising it the doubt creeps in. I was so impatient when I started this sometimes making 100 trades a day and losing overall. It has been very hard to steady down to about 5 per day and i still need the M1 charts to keep me happy. Anything else is just too slow. I have no wish to offend at all, simply an observation from someone who can see alot of themself in your writings before i found the calm button. I look forward to reading more of your progress. Andy

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Totally, agree but was thinking, 50 is abit better for a day or so, but didn't want to change it until sure. Tonight, I've been taking the Long positions on EJ which isn't wise, cause someone is dumping, so eeckss to break even then dumps 20pips in 10seconds, obvious after the effect, should of called Shorts only. 98% happy here, just got to settle down and well get a slight slight bit of luck so doomed LOL And let the few profitable trades I've had today, run there cause otherwise factor in some chop and SL hits and your just spinning your heals ofcourse. Small trades cancel out chop, hopefully with some left and the &gt;30 pip trades bring in the bacon. Live use is different to just watching, 50 calls for 2 less failing Long positions on the EJ in short. Get my pips back at the JPY's open fingers crossed so not too worried

PSGM you round ?? Log onto the chat room if you can. What's the score on the day dude ???

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Just realised the error of my ways. Got carried away with trying other peoples ideas of MAs, I forgot the entire reason why I started this thread.... Getting chopped out trying to use just MAs, and forgot the OBVIOUS!!! I stopped looking for OBVIOUS entry points!!! So went back to basics, looked for steep slopes into a move, then a steep out, using a 3/8 cross as my entry point. Keeping my TP as 15 pips per trade, unless of course I see an OBVIOUS large moves! (so some were 30, some were 40, some were 5) After I got back to basics, I started winning once again. I know which way I'm going tomorrow!!

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I am responsible and will only take for responsibility for my entries on this thread. Anything else is others opinions!! The entire thread is about KISS. If others have their take on that they are welcome to share it here, but the systems I post here are what I have been involved in the development of (in some form or another) As to the exact method TD is using then NO - I am not using that exact system!!!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Cool, as long as your making Pips, thats all that counts. Definately tailor anything you see here or not to your own likings. Sticking to my SMA based system personal, for the time being, in good swinging market times the pips are a flying, in chop not so much today was weak for the bits I saw sadly, typically!!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
PSGM: do you think maybe you could post a couple of winning charts with a little explanation of how you were taking these bounces? I do think if you can take the type of trades with the Bollinger Band that your taking for small profits, it would be profitable. Hope you had a good day. Hope we can chat live soon sometime. Take care

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I know the type of trade he's playing, I'd bet I've played a very similar setup infact every setup thats going, the issue is it's very subjective and for awhile it's working for you, then the way the market moves changes and your back to square 1. Don't under estimate how hard it is to beat this game. Still really think my system could be the 1, we are talking marriage children the entire works ( never thought I'd say that LOL ), it's simple, it's high %%% of trade profit, SL's are 1/2 the Profit levels. No doubt I'll likely sleep with it's mom or sister and screw it up though, as per always I've got to get keener on it, whoopps it's going against me EXIT to save losses though, lowered SL from 16+Spread to 12+Spread so @15 pips all in. 21% less risk

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Turveyd, I have been following along this thread, trading EUR/USD live. I have found I am more profitable working off the M5 and M15 tf''s. I have the BB (20, 2.5) with 3EMA, 8SMA, and 40SMA setup, and I watch those, but I am watching horizontal and diagonal TL's and overall chart patterns on longer tf's (up to daily) as well. I am paying attention to the news, to correlations (EU-SPX, for instance), volumes on correlated futures trades, etc. I am looking for a wholistic approach, rather than a strictly mechanical one. I find I am better off not even looking at M1 tf unless it is to fine-tune an entry or exit. Working on M1 was more laborious, and led me into the trap of accepting smaller gains, and caving in to short-term losses. M! was a little nerve-wracking; slower agrees with my laid-back nature. As I have gained confidence in this my 2nd week of live trading, I am finding that it's ok to be in a trade for more than a few minutes. For me, anyway, and for now, slower is better. Thanks for your thread and good luck in your trading.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
To me M1 all the way, it's all in the detail ( he says with no candles, actually I put them back but very subtle colour ). 2nd week and gained confidence, impressive, 4 1/2 years in and my confidence level bounces around all over the place. It's still very high. since I stopped trading, I've spotted loads of very nice moves, and every single 1 of them has worked, strange world.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hello Guys... Thanks to PSGM &amp; Turveyd for introducing a really good 1Min System. I have tried this morning from 0000hrs to 0300hrs (GMT Time). The result was sooo good, &amp; 4 trades profits (+75 pips) &amp; 1 trade lost (-18pips). Will keep update... Thanks. -ATUQUE-

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Seems I'm becoming redundant on my own thread!!! Everyone seems to be sticking to TDs method.... Included one more screenshot with what I call perfect storm and Blammo perfect storm is 2 or more moving averages crossing at virtually the exact same point, then Blammo!!! the price makes an obvious move - this is a very strong indication of the price move in the direction of the obvious candle!!!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Here's some of my trades &amp; all with profits (BIG &amp; small)... Use both PSGM &amp; Turveyd trading system... (BIG THANKS!!!) (* all when the market were trending).. Good Luck Guys...

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi atuque 1, Are you trading live? I guess you are not cos your point of entry was a bit early. High probablity of price turning against you.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi Turveyd, thanks to you for your time here, btw there was a couple of good trades since Frankfort open ! I wonder if you can specify your entry, exit and everything about your system ? Just to be sure if i do the same technique as you do, because of all of change about this system since you had introduce it in this thread ! Thanks Luk (sorry for my english)

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I've never been a follower of the KISS theory in any area. My own experience has always shown me that the most beautiful things are usually the most complex too. Markets reflect much of human behaviour are not simple, so I'd like to create a new acronym - MICC - make it complex c*nt D'you think it will catch on ?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
But for peoples that already made hundreads pips daily with KISS Wouldn't agree with you...

--- 帖子 #392 ---
No time today, should be around tommorow, PM me so I don't forget. And PSGM, without your KISS Idea, making me simplify my overly complicated system and make a simple rule, I'd of never of cracked this, so don't be too dis heartened.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I tried the MICC method, I just end up confused and blowing my account in no time. Sticking to KISS personally, suites my lazy personality and I've statistically proved indicators are a waste of space.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Turveyd, Thanks to you and PSGM because created a really good system... Ever since I trade, today is the best trading day for me because so many consistent profits!!! Even the lost happened was also due to SL got hit &amp; then the price following my trade (but already lost that)... Anyway, overall... I started Demo with 1000 (1:200 leverage) and already profit about 230!!! And that's the best I've got since I started trading!!! If consistent profit on my Demo account, I will trade Live again.. Thanks again PSGM &amp; Turveyd... KEEP IT GOING!!!

I'm really glad this is working out for you. Although on one of your earlier posts, you had a very different setup to what is on this thread. What is the exact setup you are using to trade (templates also please if possible!) and what is the criteria you are using for your trades. Do you have % win losses yet? BZ atuque

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi all, My trades went so well yesterday (even though just start learning this system). Total trades: 16 (every trade 0.2 lot) Profit trades: 12 (+186 pips) Lost trades: 4 (-70pips). I could say 75% winning yesterday... Another chart forgot to post yesterday...

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Not understanding your chart, or sure what system your using but it's working, so just to confirm can you try to spell your system out please. You might not be trading my exact rules, which might lead to a way to improve mine, or PSGM's maybe ??

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi psgm, About the setup I'm using is the same as you and Turveyd are using. Only that I add the Stochastic (5,3,3) below the chart, just to see the OB or OS momentum. My Setup for LONG: EMA3 cross SMA6 from below, then both 3/6 crossed the 20SMA, and then 50/55/65 SMA's from below. Exit when 3/6 crossed back down, towards the SMA13 &amp; 20SMA. Setup for SHORT: EMA3 cross SMA6 from above, then both 3/6 crossed the 20SMA, and then 50/55/65 SMA's from above. Exit when 3/6 crossed back up, towards the SMA13 &amp; 20SMA. Seems like it's really works on trending day.....

--- 帖子 #401 ---
And I got stuck up tweaking and optomising yet again LOL I'm getting happier, can't beat live trade experience for perfecting the system. Issues where :- Kept getting in at really crappy prices relative to the SL point. Main 50 still wasn't perfect, back to my 60sma it's tried and tested and much better IMHO ( Yep full circle here ) By the time the 3ema / 8sma crossed back down, in chop there was too much wasted. So news SMA'S LAST TIME I PROMISE!!! 2 Linear weighted ( Much quicker ) 5 SMA ( Sharper exit called ) 20 SMA ( back to the old Fav ) 60SMA ( 1hour, 1hour has been doing me good service for 2years ) Yes I'm back nearly to the original a week back LOL The short 1's are quicker and sharper and more scalper biased which is where I want to be, but a better trend SMA to keep you on the right side.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Today, started from 2300hrs (GMT), trade was not good at all... Market so choppy &amp; seems like transition zone (not sure whether go up or go down).. I should just get into when the obvious trend was there.... I am so sad today... should just learn the price / trend movement on Friday (profit taking day - for other people...)

--- 帖子 #403 ---
PGSM, Nice to know you have found your touch back. Just relying on crossing of MA is not good enough. General observation is that it may work when trending. Even then, the PA is affected by presence of pivots, S/R etc.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
As friday is no trades day, looked up my old zulu trade account (pedigreepips if anyone wants to check them out!), as I wanted to try out a theory of mine, which is even easier than the method I have put on this thread!!! Hadn't been on it for a while, so ignore anything before today on that a/c!!! 1st day : Total pips 672+ total lost trades 2 - 1 caused by finger trouble (first day errors!!) total lost pips - 3! total trades 18 there were a few trades that had significant higher highs than when I closed them out, however, I just wanted to see if my theories held! So far so good!! shame I don't have the trading budget I need to do this for myself yet!!!

Okay HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!!!!!!! SORRRYYYYYY BUT CONSTANTLY ADAPTING THIS THEME UNTIL I COME UP WITH SOMETHING REALLY SWEET. Current Issues with existing system :- Tooooooo much Chop on Friday. Was not trading a long enough Trend, which is KEY!!!! Solution thus far :- Slower SMA's in short for the No Trade Zone, which is now composed of 60SMA and 180SMA yes it's BIG yes it's sometimes wasteful, but back testing the EJ over the last week. Running a 240sma don't trade off it, but watch for trouble near it, sometimes don't take a trade if it's too near wait for it to confirm to. Currently not running a 3EMA Filter will assess when the market is moving, so it's higher speed price generated. Exits, I dunno, lets get the Entrys right then scalp or hold longer term depending on how it's looking, object is go for the 40+ pip moves on the EJ. SERIOUS On the practically does not lose, well as long as you take your profit and don't be too greedy

Hi psgm, Can u pls post your set up. I want to know what u trade. Thanks. Real pips.

Hi Turveyd, Well done for all u been doing and i have been following. Can u pls at this point in time state your set up for this week. Thanks. Real pips.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I have given up constantly amending the ema's being used, as to me either the system works or it doesn't! No point planning a setup on yesterdays movements!!! My strategy is basically what I set up from the first entry on this thread!! If I want to put in multiple emas, I may as well include the rainbow indicator and have done!!! I think the real problem has been that I have been given suggestions from people who have been trading for many years, but don't really know precisely why an indicator / moving average has been added. Therefore if I don't know why it was added, then I cannot verify if it is useful or not. The reason why I would possibly give an indication of a move (if nothing else it gives me a heads up of a potential move 3/8 cross after a strong bounce off the bollinger is yet another indicator that a move is going to occur. if the 3 then crosses the 20 ma, then assuming you have used default settings then there is even more evidence that the move is a relatively strong one. Finally, if there is a strong move in just one candle, added to the other previous indications, then there is a higher likelihood that the move is a valid one! To be honest, I think the only serious way to trade this, is to look over a chart and look for very strong movements that have occured in the past. Try to pick no more than 5 patterns that you can easily recognise, and emblaze these in your memory. Note what occured prior to these moves, and the typical movement afterwards. Therefore you will now simply be looking for 1 of 5 patterns that you can trade with regularly. If it helps, sure add emas, stochastic etc etc to confirm, but the mark 1 eyeball, was is and forever shall be the best indicator of change in the world!! Took mother nature millions of years to create it - don't think man has improved on it - certainly not yet as least!!! there are a number of examples I have posted on this thread for you to study - but don't take my word for it. Use your eyes, look for STRONG moves that have occured before and look at the pattern of candles when YOU consider the move to have been confirmed. These patterns WILL occur (if not exactly the same) Getting bogged down with configurations, defeats the point of this thread!!! If you are not sure why an indicator is used - don't use it!!!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Realpips, thats the plan so far, 60sma and 180sma, longs above both only, shorts above both only, and enters the zone in between just exit and give up, seems to be my findings. PSGM, I'm just trying to get the trend locked down in a manner thats repeatable and tradeable, my original concept 20/60sma No trade zone worked but only in really fast moving markets, using it friday cost me dear ( on a demo account I'm happy to say ) 90% sure I've got that nailed, it's taken long enough, perfect no but good enough, failing to come up with a current plan for entrys and exits with the trend, so 3ema/8sma is likely going to be used, trading near the 60/180 works for repeat buys nicely at times with good pippage, but without a exit strategy well CONFUSED. Demo trade above and hope something else pops into my head for a solution, to the next problem, then start solving the next problem

--- 帖子 #412 ---
SMA's give me a simple market direction, past sadly ofcourse, but a 1hour and 3hour confirming the direction is a strong probability of success in short, inbetween it could really go either way so no trades and give up, odds are slightly in favour it'll move to the other SMA then I got nothing. I've been using SMA's in this manner for YEARS ( Still not rich sadly ), so hence the simplistic rules, crack the current direction and your odds on winning a trade are greatly improved. If this isn't working in a weeks time, I'll think of or find something else and keep going until cracked. I like that THV but for some reason it's not loading on my Meta ( I'll try it with the market moving ) It's a Puzzle, it needs to be beaten, when beaten given enough repetitisions and patience even with a small initial outlay you can become a millionaire, and with a good broke that doesn't cut you off LOL

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Sorry 60sma and 150sma. And I've gone back 3 weeks and tested random times scrolling the chart forward ( trust me my memory isn't that good ) and it keeps winning.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
I have not rules out the possibility of just trading the 3ema / 8sma and 20sma crosses, that almost works on it's own, a method that may be masterable maybe ??

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Moved to a 3EMA / 10EMA Cross ( yes both EMA ), only cause I can run a MACD which used 2 EMA's and displays the difference between them, making it easier and more mechanical to see when they cross 20SMA is still on the table, good performer. I expect, 3E/10E cross, with the trend filter ( 60S/150S ) rules, is going to be the back bone of the system. There really is no better short term direction view of the market I can see sadly!!

--- 帖子 #416 ---
alhamdulillah...Thanks for sharing....i'm just closed profit for two post...

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Just played around with using the Fibonacci tool in a "simple" way" I know that you are supposed to look for reversal candles around the 50, 68% levels, however, there are a number of times when they can retrace to 31.8 or lower. So the Kiss solution - wait until the fib level is at - or exceeded 100%!!! That way, you have illiminated most (if not all) the doubt. True you may well be losing out on lots of move, but hey if you are going to use the fib tool, you are looking for a move to the 161.8% point. I have just used this twice - for 25 pips and 15 pips The second I also added another "kiss" principle - key levels. I waited for the price to reach 10 pips around the ".00" level - to ensure there is strength in the move. The next levels from there are .25 then .50 .75 and so on. This was an additional caution to my trade, as I would have entered 15 pips earlier using the 100% method! The added beauty of this, is that typically the move is relatively quick once it has hit the 100% mark, whereas for the 68%, you could have significant "chop" before reaching the 100%. REMEMBER... If you HAVE correctly picked a fib then, then it MUST cross the 100%!!!!

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Only the 100% and 0% are worth bothering wist. EJ works great with the sweet spots, buy near 00, look for 50 to exit very repeatable recently. I like the MACD for just simply showing the difference between 3ema and 10ema PSGM, try that, there is really no point holding against that good odds it'll get a move pretty much all the time, which if against you is not nice.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
New system is demo testing well, it's keeping me more or less on the 3hour market direction, as said before if your with the trend your odds improve hugely. The no trend zones filtered out a lot of chop. The MACD 3,10 is a better easier to read when the scale of the market is huge for the cross, working as a very good immediate current direction. Current setting. 3EMA 10EMA 20sma 60sma 180sma ( dumped the 2 just went with the 1 normally pretty close ) MACD 3,10,1 Confidence is high, I thought I had no winning system last week, PANIC as Fridays conditions was well useless with the old 1.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Taught a uber intelligent girlie how to trade my system, never traded before at all, she had 30mins spare last night to look at it and made 66pips must of picked a good time. WOWSA thats before my improvements from the weekend ( Which basically reduces the losses, wouldn't effect performance during good times ) Woman's luck hey

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi Turveyd, I am confused... Is it 150SMA or 180SMA?? How about 40SMA, not used anymore?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
It started off as 150, with 180 as a dotted caution line, I decided to just go for the straight 180 in the end. On the grounds I'm REALLY Liking this and finally ( I think ) happy, I'm pretty much 17% sure there won't be any changes That and 92pips of Demo trading profit The 3E/10E is KEY, don't just buy on a break unless it's strong, use the 3E/10E cross to get in and out but only with the trend. Being really aggressive on moving that stop up to, gets to +5 pips, move to -5 ( including spread ), +15 for 0!!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
60ie 1hour is a much better trend SMA!! The 20sma is still there though It did start with a 50/60sma spread. New Templates Attached!!

--- 帖子 #424 ---
By the way, you can just go short under, go long over and WAIT if you choose the 60sma and 180sma trends are strong enough and generally last long enough. So yes it's cheating Take EJ for instance, the 180 all the way up was only broke 3times, which puts you against the trend for -45 simplisically, with a 300pip upside potential

--- 帖子 #425 ---
So, Do you see the trend is going down now, for long or just temporary only? I see it will go short for long term here...

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Well, I went short on the first break under -11, then long shortly after +12 then short again on the break back under +27 so good enough for me. You will never know how long it's going to go for, EVER EVER EVER just jump on it and hope it continues enough to make you happy!! If you think it's going to be a long ish term short, then hold until the 60sma is taken out and hope at that stage you've got some profit, could be 100pips could be 10pips. Trail your stop just over the 60sma. Looking to reset up a short near the 60sma, when the 3E/10E turns back to negative, or on a move over then back under!!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
And that would be a rather disapointing OUT just then. EU threating to break back to Longs. EJ should run back to the 180sma generally ( in back test highly probable ) The 180holding and turning it back down or powering through is a gamble, although you could use the 3E/10E to trade a down move off it, it's risky cause once through it'll ( historically ) get a quick move hitting your SL and the trend is kinda mixed, 60min up, 180min just about clinging to down. I lost alot of trades trading short under a 180min to watch it go up, these SMA's are taken from my system of old, so I know the probability of them working. EU blipped over and blipped back under, 3E/10E still heading north though and going up again. EJ about to hit the 180

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Ok.. So, meaning that when EJ hit 180 &amp; go north, it will save to go LONG and just keep long? Another one, what does the MACD (3,10,1) show? Does it show the momentum or the trend?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
EJ touching 180sma as expected and hovering just underneath, MACD I don't think went Negative ( 3E/10E cross ). Yes you could traded the 3E/10E cross and nailed +25 pips ( easy after the fact ), but trading against the trend over all is going to get you a smaller profit than with, for a higher risk, so stick to the safer option you'll get richer quicker trust me I've blown ALOT of accounts ( small 100pips at a time ) getting to +4 pips to then hold for -20 in 30seconds!!! Yes I'm also very unlucky, I don't believe in luck and she knows it and hates me for it. 180sma stopped and reversed short term!!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Seems like the 180SMA showing the LONG will turn back down to south. READY TO SHORT BIG TIME?? OR IT's JUST FOR SHORT TIME ONLY?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Moved back over, Long here hoping we'll get some kinda a trend move worth a damn, but we'll see, SLOW CHOPPY DAY!!! Getting Nickel and Dimmed looking for that trend move here, okay breaking even on the day shoulda been up slightly but miss read a few things. EJ could run to 131.50 over the next hour or so as we know, then that'll be worth putting up with the chop.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
The trick of this game, is minimizing your losses to chop with small losses and small profits to hopefully offset them, and due to thee you've got to be in it to win it rule, that puts you in the game hopefully when the big move comes. can we take out 131 Yes would be my theory, EU went uptrend to.

Live trading experience dictates dumping the 10ema totally. 20sma is changed to 21ema for there close similarity and MACD compliance, MACD is changed to 3,21,1. I feel this is a more reliable scalping tool!!

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Turveyd, I would like to know, in which TF do you see the trends &amp; which MA do you see to get the idea on trending? Is it the 60SMA or 180SMA, and is it in 5M or 1M TF? I got chopped easily so many times yesterday..

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I got chopped around to, when to trade and not to is SOOOO important and damn today was weak yet again, Wednesday should rock I'm working not trading Despite bad execution on my behalf I'm up a bit today, not much but with the chop state I'm happy at that. New settings today really liking them 3EMA ( same ) 15EMA ( and MACD 3,15,1 to show these 2's difference ) Notice I've dumped the 8 and the 20, just a 15, much easier working well tonight 60SMA and 180SMA. All M1 you'll just get confused flicking to different TF's. Nice chunk of change available from this on the EJ tonight, Short @130.99 all the way to near 130.00 nice!! Can I master this in a live trade scenario without having to add more pips is the question, it'll be beat have no doubt Taught a very clever ( and cute ) newbie girlie the system, ZERO trade experience, up 130pips with no losers, womans luck hey!!

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Starting to get more and more variations to systems - now macd is added, increasing to 4 moving averages +++ It may well work, but this is NOT KISS!!! I'm outta here!!!

--- 帖子 #437 ---
fine, leave. but you know what? you'll miss out completely on the next 30 systems turveyd will create within the next month.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Well, 4 SMA's / EMA's only really, the MACD just shows graphically the difference between 3ema and 15ema, this is simpler and 1 SMA less. But hey have a moody hissy fit And looking at it fresh this morning, I see no need for changes, just needs a new operator

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Easier system which looks to be working great on the JPY. Sweet spots .00 and .50, go short under the .00 for instance on resistance being spotted, tight SL .10 area, target .50. Long on a move over for the next SS!!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi Turveyd, Just to confirm your system, you are using: 3EMA (close) 15EMA (close) 60SMA (close) - "S" for Simple (not Smoothed, right) 180SMA (close) - "S" for Simple (not Smoothed, right) MACD (3,15,1) and between 60 and 180 still no trade? Is that right? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Yep sounds like it. Becoming Flexible on the no trade, if it's near too each other or if the 180sma is going up steep then definately still no trade. 3 chops SL's earlier then got it all back so bleeding break even again, must stop trading in stupid chop times hey!!

--- 帖子 #442 ---
How did it work for you today ??? Nearly disasterous here for me, every trade seems to get to +2 then reverse on me, Arrrggghhhhhhh too much chop, I'm never around for the good times, shame cause it works very well when it works and if you hold long enough. Thankfully I got 60pips on EJ's Dump, my last trade before sending another cheque doh!!! So in profit just about on the day. So, as I don't believe in no win scenario's what is the solution ??? The 60sma, 180sma and 15sma are SPOT on, so need to keep these. And I like the 3ema for drawing a nice smooth chart direction. 3ema/15ema cross although good while in to hold longer is too slow, 3e/10e worse as more fake trades. I dropped a 15sma 0.1% envelope range on, and used it to stop me taking longs near the high of the range. So I'm thinking about using a BB or envelope to create a buy at the low BB sell at the high BB tyre plan, but only using the previous rules so with the trend, against the trend is suicidal. BUT I can't find a setting I'm happy with as yet so..... HELPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or other cunning plans which could work along this line.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
After flicking through 100's of scalper threads and trying 100's of chart setups I've came to the conclusion the only solution is Patience There sadly is no System solution, got to manually read the action and make smart trades with the trend as dictated and stay out when there is no trend. I'm screwed!!

--- 帖子 #444 ---
..this works..as you just said this is only patience...I sit for 2-3 hours waiting for that set up and when it comes I take it, see this trade I only took this morning for about 30 pips. It is so now that I only lose if I get bored of waiting and foolishly decide to break my own rules otherwise I win every time I put the wager in, this is my easy button. do try it...and try and take only quality trades even if that means you sit and wait for hours.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Pretty much what I'm doing, but with the missing ingredient of patience. Thats the difference between Demo account and Real for me, Demo I'm chilled and patience, Live I don't want to miss anything, greed kicks in. Guess a system can only take you so far

--- 帖子 #446 ---
don't be greedy, i know easier said than done. there is no system that can teach not to be greedy or fearful for that matter

--- 帖子 #447 ---
240Volts through my balls, make a stupid trade ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!! That might drum it into me Or kill me!! Thanks dude, good night!!

--- 帖子 #448 ---
You stated there 15SMA.. Is it 15SMA or 15EMA? You explaint about both 15EMA &amp; 15SMA? Which one to be used actually??

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Pretty much abandoned the idea, although works great during trend moves, buggered if I know when a trend move is coming. So still got the 180sma, 60sma, 20 SMA ( works better with the envelope ) . Then I'm running a 5EMA to give me the direction, no crosses involved too damn slow which = much pain in chop. Also got a Envelope 20sma, 0.08% which I use as a vague chop range, buy near the bottom, tight SL, bla bla bla on seeing Support and Vice Versa. Also running a Stochastic, %K 15, %d 3, Slowing 5 which is a nice chop get in, it turns up faster than a SMA cross, so look for near 0 and starts heading up bla bla. Empahsis has become very much, get on the trend at a good price, rather than it's crossed up IN, ohhh thats a crap price, retrace Stopped It's working well on Demo, +240pips with no losers on EJ. All trades are considered scalps, until you get lucky enough to be holding at the start of a big trend move, then let it run, until then, keep banking small profits, finding EJ's got a useable noise / chop range 20-30pips generally. Trade off the SMA's as S/R and only above the the 60sma and 180sma, basically with the trend. KISS Not really, but it's working in Demo, try it Live tonight / tommorow I guess, want some more demo practice first, I think this is nearer but smarter to how I was trading when I got 23wins in a row and 4x's the account. EJ's Sweetspots are KEY to, it responds well to 00 and 50 being S/R very well indeed!! Bottom fishing is risky, so 10+spread SL in use, not 1 Demo hit yet demo hey Easy he says!!! Time and Money Limited, NEED TO GET THIS PROFITABLE ASAP, so hence the changes and trying new things, your getting it live as I work it out, stick around I SHALL Crack it, or die trying!!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hey Turveyd You really are going round in circles faster and faster. Looking at your posts you look like a bank holiday weekend away from the screens will do you good. A fresh start on Tuesday and stick to one set up. Otherwise your growing self doubt will do you in come the end.My post 204 had a nice template I have used this week to good effect. Pm me if you wish and I'll talk you through my setup in detail. Andy

--- 帖子 #451 ---
No time to slow down, need to be making Pips good pips and SOON!!! Yes I've traded this S/R channel / Chop before to, or very near to, learning as I go on what works and doesn't and when to do it. But I'm either ill which is possible, headache/sickness bug going around, or just shattered from working + thinking about Trading and strategising full time, role on the weekend this week. Will pm you when home thanks, might of missed something. IF I can Live trade like I've been demoing the last 24hours or so, I'll be a millionaire in no time, sadly it never works that way hey

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi Andypips, I downloaded your template and looks interesting,can you post the setup details. Thank you, zsozso69

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi Z I will email you the details as i have noticed you also sent me an email. Will try to do it later tonight if I get time. Andy

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi andypips, Why not talk to me through your setup in detail. Will appreciate it. Thanks. Real pips.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Oh boy..another thread hijacked. So now, what's going to be the next big amazingly- accurate indicator on the mix??

--- 帖子 #456 ---
It's not that it don't work, cause well it does hugely, it's the best thing since sliced bread, BUT it's either :- 1. I'm the unluckiest Son of a Bitch that ever lived. 2. I can't trade with real money ( I mean $1 per pip here hardly real ), to save my own life. As I don't believe in Luck it's obviously no.2 Demo, WIN WIN WIN WIN, Real LOSe LOSE LOSE tis getting ANNOYING!!

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hey buddy!! Not to be rude or anything but, if you look at the title on this thread, the stuff should be kept as simple as it is. Why don't you get back to the original view on the thread and start all over? or better yet, why don't you just simply take all this crap out of you charts and begin to see the market on what it really is? Price If you keep mixing MA's and the like, you'll never find a good setup. Even if you do, the market will turn it's back on your sooner or later. That's just the way it is. Anyway, it's your money.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
You will lose your account as you did before, work on yourself, not only on the system you use. BTW: where you got your vouchers from? You are acting like a rookie!!!

--- 帖子 #459 ---
But it works so so so so so so very well with Demo, just some statical blips and lack of funds enduced losses I think, mixed with a lack of sleep!! Couple of days off, some Demo practice and more money in the account ( Already sent ), hopefully will get me back on track. Find out soon ish!!

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Myself is the issue fully aware of this. No Rookie, 2months ish back I was profitable and account was sky rocketing then back to square 1. This trading is a weird weird problem to be solved.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
What the hell are you talking about?? What is working? Demo? You're daydreaming my friend, wake up, take a pill. Like Cobra said, you're talking like a rookie! Besides you just hijacked this guy's thread with just that utterly stupidity about trying to corner the market on hindsight. You can't wait and hope that you're moving average(s) will give you an statistical edge. In real time, it doesn't work my friend. Just to be nice, Here's some reading you should do. In this very forum by the way. 1) Read "System I and System II by feb2865 - That's trading 101 in my opinion.I believe every trader no matter how experienced, should read what this gentleman says. 2)Silent Service Method - by clockwork71 - another gem. Very comprehensive and well-defined way of trading. There you go. Please do us a favor and get some perspective. Stop acting foolish!! Unless you just want to keep getting you ass handed back to you in a silver plate , then is your money anyway. Thank You.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Seriously, +240pips trading EJ on the demo account and not 1 loss using the same SL, so the question is what am I doing different or just abit of bad statistical probability ?? No hindsight required it works really well, IF you avoid the chop and only trade at the good times, my back testing is objective. I will check out those threads though, thanks!!

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hmm... wondering where's everybody? I hope PSGM will be back to this thread, because I'm using his setup (Bolinger Band 20,2, &amp; MA's 3/8) which already made more pips than ever!!! PSGM, please come back....

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I'm busy live demo trading various setups and working out the Stat's on what setup works best / works at all in the long term. Best setup so far for EJ is Envelope 200sma Dev 0.22% short near the top on resistance or short on a move over then back into the Envelope, not creating many trades but there safe thus far. Keep those profits going dude and keep it simple!!

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Thanks Turveyd for your reply... I have tried your various setups, but seems like a lot of it made my entry too early &amp; made me lost due to counter trends.. So, I use PSGM setups (Bollinger Band-20,2; EMA3, SMA8 &amp; SMA20, with SMA90-Low &amp; SMA90-High) ----&gt; made me profit again!! The only thing, need to be a bit patient &amp; that will give you best entry point...

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Been away for quite a while - seems my thread has been used for entries OTHER than what it was intended for - KEEP IT SIMPLE!!!!!!!! Not sure if possible to clean up the thread, hence started a new thread - trying to keep with the spirit of what it was intended for! good luck guys in all your trading!

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi, What are your entry and exit factors?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
My entry point for SELL: 1) in TF M5, see the down trend on 80/90SMA 2) look at TF M1, based on the bollinger band (BB20/2.0),the price should touch the top BB and bounce back down. 3) EMA3 should cross SMA8 downward, also crossdown SMA20 (in BB). That's when I enter SELL. 4) The EXIT will be when the price touch or pass the bottom BB. Can psgm clear that, maybe I'm wrong? The Key is Patience...

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Been away for a while, as this thread was moving away from KISS principles! Have been trying to refine my original concept, so it has more clarity - and I think I may have got somewhere. I noticed more often than was merely chance that when you get 3 consecutive candles (either bullish or bearish) that is a high probability reversal. I also noticed a couple of other features: 1) the price action prior to these 3 candles tends to be a fairly steep angle 2) the bollinger bands tend to flatten out / change direction by the 3rd candle of the pattern. Using these observations, I came up with a strategy for trading. On the close of the 3rd candle, ENTER. Exit signals are more tricky under the KISS method, and I am still working on an effective sell. What I have found, (and I deliberately haven't entered here as I do NOT think the exit fits KISS) is to use the THV3 system as my exit strategy. I am not going into too much detail on the exit strategy (yet) as I say it does not adhere to KISS (yet), but I am working hard on it! However, as a rough guide, basically I use the fast trix having a second change of colour as my exit - (this means nothing unless you look at the THV system) The reason why I use this, as there are so many people on forex factory using that method, I would see if it was useful to me. And through LIVE TRADING, determined I could improve it for MY style of trading (my method generally gives me more of the move) to give you an idea of how I am doing with this system, prior to this I was really content with 15 pip TP wins, in the first day of using this I was 60 pips up in 2 trades. Admittedly it helps that there are strong movements (starting 0600 BST seems to be a good time at the moment), however, it is clear that 100+ pips in the current market is relatively easily achieved. I have used it on the 1 minute chart, (as I am still not comfortable with the larger stop losses required for longer timeframes), but it works on ALL currencies and ALL timeframes. 5 minutes is very good. As soon as I have worked out a stronger KISS exit strategy I shall let you guys know! As for any questions regarding moving averages, to be brutally honest, I only started using them as I got suckered into it by posts on this thread - as you can see from my charts I no longer use them! However if you are using them and getting good pips - then don't change REMEMBER - If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!! I am only posting this to share where I am with KISS! Keep it up guys, and good pippage to you all!

--- 帖子 #470 ---
hi thxs PSGM while reading this thread from the start in the first three pages made three trades (live small lots ) and set a tp at 10 pips and thanks to KISS i am now 30 pips better off

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Finally got the final piece of the jigsaw in place!!! As I said on my last entry, what I needed was a KISS method of finding an exit strategy for my trades, and I believe I have an answer (at least it works for me!!!) OK on the 1 min chart (any currency - although only tried this on GBP/USD - so values may well be different for other currencies - besides enough can be made from the GBP/USD alone!) What you are looking for are psych levels for the exit (i.e. 00,25,50,75). The trick is, you exit just over the 25. Entry is after the 3rd consecutive bullish candle (long) 3rd consecutive bearish candle (short) Recommended that the price is either touching or has just bounced off the bollinger band (default (2,20), and that the bollinger has flattened / changed angle. (i.e. if the bollinger band is rising steeply, and does not change angle, then it is highly likely that it is merely a retracement rather than a full reversal. examples: Entry 1.6423 - exit 1.6450 (bullish) exit 1.6375 (bearish) (round to the nearest 25 pip then add 25!) Entry 1.6372 - exit 1.6400 (bullish) exit 1.6325 (bearish) (round to the nearest 25 pip then add 25!) Entry 1.6408 - exit 1.6450 (bullish) exit 1.6375 (bearish) (round to the nearest 25 pip then add 25!) Do you see the pattern???? Obviously this will not happen 100% of the time (if it did I would be a billionaire by now!!!), however I would say it gives very high probability trades. Also if the price does not quite reach, then dependant upon your risk tolerance I would suggest moving your stop losses into a positive territory (I suggest if you get to within 10 pips of the target, then at the very least set your profit to break even then when within 5 change to +15 / +20 pips - Assuming the price target is hit your minimum will be 25 pips! Typical is 30-35 pips. Also if you are feeling adventurous, and you believe this is a very strong move then the next target would be an additional 25 pips and so on (but my method would give you around 100 pips in 3/4 trades a day!) If you want to check out exactly what I mean, check the previous charts I have entered, then go back on your own platformsk and look for the 3 candle formations. notice what the bollinger band is doing. Notice what happens when you get 3 candles but no reversal! It was truly a revalation when I noticed it !!! Good trading peeps!

--- 帖子 #472 ---
PSGM, My chart and BB are very different from yours. Just to check that I am using the same configuration as you. TF 1m Gbp/Usd pair BB - Period -20 Shift -1 Deviations -2 Apply to - close

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi Horn, Yours are different, due to different time for broker.... You have to see (on your trade platform) on 19 June 09, at 05:07hrs.... then you will see the similar trend.... On my broker time, it was on 08:07 hrs...

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi , Would different brokers result id different candles. If I look at the time you quoted, the candle indicated by arrow is a down candle whilst that of PSGM is an up candle.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
could u please explain it to me step by step ...about the setting here ?? i don't understand how to set up the correct setting thx

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Thanks PSGM for the comeback!!! Agreed with your setup, but seems like very hard to achieve a lot of that setup in one day. BTW, I still use ur setup using the Bollinger Bands, and I add 1 more useful Accelerator Oscilator (because it gives warning a few minutes before change of trends give tips for exits). Love it so much &amp; trying few days with this BB &amp; AC (accelerator osci). Take a look at it...

Looking for a profitable interday or intraday EA Hey, Do you have a good profitable EA that you can give me please- Im new to Forex and I would love to have an profitable EA.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
FYI, hard for us to make EA for this system &amp; we are doing scalping , using M1 TF, not inter or intraday trading.. U might find it in other threads.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hope you are all being successful on the forex! Noticed something relatively interesting on the £/$ yesterday as I was doing my usual hunt for elusive KISS methodologies. What I noticed is that if the price has reversed, and it has reversed for at least 10 - 15 pips, then theere is a HIGH probability that there is at minimum another 10 pips in the trade! So just a thought - if you use a 15 -20 pip SL then there are MANY MANY MANY 10 pip+ trades throughout the day. Must say I have NOT tested this live (yet), and yes it is not textbook money management / risk reward ratio. However I have just put it out there to see if anyone else has noticed this! You still use the bounce of the bollinger, and (I am not suggesting just go in the direction of ANY 10+ pip move). If someone wants to demo this sometime and comeback with their findings that would be great! For Info the 3 moving averages are 50EMA (LIME), 100EMA(BLUE), and 200EMA (RED). These can be used rather effectively too, however this is wandering away from KISS!!!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
psgm Do you mean those 10 pips bounces that are in direction of trend are good for this trading method you mentioned in your last post? Can suggest a MA the shows one minute trend direction?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
What I am saying, is that when you have noticed a bounce, and that bounce has moved at least 10 pips, then there is a high likelihood of there beig AT LEAST 10 pips in the move. As a VERY VERY ROUGH RULE OF THUMB. the move is more often than not 2 times the first 3 candles. For example, if the first 3 candles move 15 pips, then I would expect the move to be around 30 pips (making the entire move from the start 45 pips) Also I do not necessarily count doji candles in the count (long wicks small bodies). Again rule of thumb - doji candles are neutral, and should not be counted -either for or against. What this measn in effect, is that if you got 2 good bullish candles, and a doji, if the 4th candle is another bullish, then this could be regarded as the 3rd - however it also means that the overal move could be relatively weak. The best way to observe what I mean is to simply watch the charts unfold, and see what happens! the best trades for this method are 3 roughly equally sized bullish or bearish candles. Check either this site or the internet to study more about these candlestick formations.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi all, Hope trading is going well for everyone. Came across a potential aid for improving entry into trades. It has 3 moving averages (so is it still KISS ?) these are all exponential movial averages : 50 ema 100 ema 200 ema Basically how it aids is this - I think there is very little argument that going with the trend is a GOOD idea, so the ideal is to find BUY trades when the trend is UP, and SELL trends when the trend is DOWN. To that end, the 200 ema is the longer term trend ( I believe the big boys use 200 simple moving average - but don't quote me on that!) Anyway, the 50ema and 100 ema act as a guide. In the screenshot included notice how the 40 and 100 are relatively widely spaced and in a general uptrend. When I see this pattern, I generally rub my hands as I know I am going to make money!!! Right in this screenshot I have attempted to highlight all the upward moves that would have been available. I may have missed some, but it does give a good view. As for exits, there is no definite (if x is.... do y), but as a guide on the 1 min charts you are going to be looking for little and often - anything in the range of 10 - 30 pips on no news periods / mid session. What I will say though, is that I was following other peoples advice with regard to stop losses and using 15 pips - THIS IS NOT BIG ENOUGH!!!!! I was getting into horrendous chop using 15 pips - I lost count the number of times I had 18 pip retraces!!! I have moved my SL out to 20 - 25 pips now. This has had the effect of keeping me in for longer on trades. I am not going into a debate on how I should be looking for risk - reward of 2:1 etc etc. All I know is that this works! It may not be perfect - it may not be pretty - but it is effective!!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Just for interest I have attached an updated screenshot to show you the direction of the trade....... Notice there was yet another small trade available. This was taken Thurs 23 July 2009 at 09:56 BST. I do not believe there is any major news event occuring as I speak, but I could be wrong!!! If you are looking for anything around 50-100 pips a day this is a good mechanism to achieve this. It does involve active particiapation (i.e. you have to look for the moves - but if you are trading the smaller timeframes you should be doing this anyway!!!)

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi I'm New to FOREX let me know the period of your Bolinger Band please regards Javid

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Might be a bit tricky as not using one!!! However whenever I used bollinger - I used default settings

--- 帖子 #174 ---
psgm Is the descreption for the trade that the three EMA should be in the same direction trending and the space between them should be wide enough?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Indeed, if the emas are relatively evenly spaced, and trending, then this is a strong indicator of trades in that direction. Belt and braces, if you check the larger timeframes and they are in the same direction - should give extra confirmation
