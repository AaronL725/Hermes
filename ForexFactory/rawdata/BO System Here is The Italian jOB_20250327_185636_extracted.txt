Last Update 19 May 2015

Hi everyone, I'm Michael, I'm writing from Italy, so sorry for my bad english. I would like to share my personal strategy. I've did a lot of studies and with a simple methodology(because simple is better), I've created a very reliable strategy. Certainly I can't garantee "ever green" days, but with my strategy I can get an ITM range between 65% and 75%. Rarely, but it happens, it touch 50% of ITM.

I want to know what do you think about it and how you could filter out the wrong signals.

I named the strategy "The Italian jOB".

Important: This is the original one, the first strategy where we started. Then you'll find last update at the end of the post.

----->NOW CHECK THE LAST UPDATE<-----

Thanks to Swingman we have all in a simple indicator, a really nice Matrix where we just need to wait all the signals. The best results are obtained on a 5 minutes TF with a 10 minutes expiry. Max successive loss registered from the system with this setup is 4 (5minTF-10minEXP), so you can think to apply a Martigale MM.

Again, sorry for my English...I would like to annouce that I'm working on something better e really powerfull.

I'll happy to give my contribute to those thinking to create an automated software.

Please do not hesitate to say what you think, hope to help someone...but please, try in demo!!!

Special thanks to SwingMan

is this strategie for binary options?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
hi, thx for sharing! just some questions: where do you set your stop loss and take profit? And how do you manage the trade once you're in it? THX!

Shuo

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Yes, BO means binary options. So no SL or TP.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Nice, will try in it on the demo!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Mike

Are you still trading this, I`m already trading a system like this and have now tweaked a little with yours. Trade BO 5mins sprint with IG rating around 75%.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
You will never shut down the real Napster.

[quote=ilMike;7679088]{quote} Yes, BO means binary options. So no SL or TP.[/quote

Nice and impressive results!

What are your results for trading regular currency pairs in Forex?

Is your Stoch at 5,3,3?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
maxwell

my shoc setting is 14,3,3

Oh almost forgot, delete the BB in both windows they are not needed.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Here is my small contribution to the system:

- Signal matrix with ADX filter

- (Bid + Ask) / 2 line

- Template

.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Wouldnt it be better if the conditions for entry are made into one indicator with alert so as to make it easier to follow ? Just my idea because to watch all the conditions to be met will be tiresome. Anyway subscribed.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Swingman just put all the entry condition into one indi -- se his matrix indi two post above.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
i check EUR USD  TF 15M entry when BRSI and two others indicator start from the same direction, look interesting .

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hello everyone, I'm sorry but I have been quite busy. I am pleased that all you are interested in my system but I noticed that the template that I have attached in the first post, have a minor error: the BollingerBand must be set to 20-2, not 14-2 as template. Better if you set to 20-2.2 to filter some bad signal.

SwingMan, simply thank you! You really did an amazing job and simplified everything for us all! With this tool, now I could make a more detailed test! I was able to improve the power of the basic strategy! Thank you very much! Maybe you can help us by adding a little thing that you'll find here now...it will be great!

Here's how I could improve the strategy, filtering several wrong signals:

_Edit the standard boItalianJob Matrix parameters like the follow image, in the specific set BB from 14-2 to 20-2.2 (so if you want, change them on your chart window too)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Add this to filter negative signals

_Create a new Stoch window with this setup: 12.3.3.
_optional: create another one stoch indicator with this parameters: 14,3,1 (this second is for a 2 minute trade strategy...then you will understand why)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Strategy ONE
1 Minutes TF, 5 Minute trade:

Put entry:

_boItalianJob Matrix must generate all red signal, arrow included!

_New Stoch 12,3,3 must be above the 90 level.

_At the candle closing, only if all conditions are met, make your put entry immediately.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Call entry:

_boItalianJob Matrix must generate all green signal, arrow included!

_New Stoch 12,3,3 must be belove the 10 level.

_At the candle closing, only if all conditions are met, make your call entry immediately.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You'll find template and indicators attached

If the generated signals are too few for you, you can also try with this 2 minutes strategy:

Strategy TWO
1 Minute TF, 2 Minutes trade:

Put entry:

_New Stoch 12,3,3 must be above the 90 level.

_New Stoch 14,3,1 must to touch and close at the maximum level, so >=99 (major or egual)

_If at the closing the candle on our chart is beyond the Bollinger band(20-2.2), and all other conditions are met, make your put entry immediately.

Call entry:

_New Stoch 12,3,3 must be above the 10 level.

_New Stoch 14,3,1 must to touch and close at the maximum level, so <=1 (minor or egual)

_If at the closing the candle on our chart is beyond the Bollinger band(20-2.2), and all other conditions are met, make your call entry immediately.

Obviously guys, don't trade in those days full of news. When there are strong news(3 bulls/red news), wait at least an hour before making a new entry trade.

Hope to help someone, but please, try it in demo before you risk your money. If you have some idea, please share!

looking good for scalping .... subscribed but need to check on trading day nice work ilmike

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Mike,

if I'm not mistaken, they no longer want to have in the Matrix the signals of BBRSI?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi SwingMan, thanks for your reply. BBRSI is a must, so please do not delete from the Matrix. At the original matrix we need to add another new stoch 12,3,3 so we can have less but better signal.  Bollinger band on bbrsi still with the original setup, bollinger bands on chart must be 20-2.2. Hope that my explanation is clear now  thanks for your support, I really appreciate!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi all, already checked yesterday on the American market, 90% of the wining trades.

Thank you for your system, trading on the news on the M1, in between boring, This is what works for me.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
IMPORTANT: Read the post 14 because i edited what i wrote before to make the strategy better to be understood.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
thats hearing good thought lets work it out

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Respectfully, I have tried to add different oscillators to the same subgraph with no luck. I know how to do it on MT4, the problem is since each oscillator operates on a fixed scale, so as you try to back test the lines move.

For instance, if during live trading, say a stoch & rsi cross, mark that cross and see what happens to it in the future. Once in a while the cross holds up, however most of the time the cross will be at a different candle on historical charts.

If this is unclear, try this:

• Put 3 oscillators on the same subgraph

• Add 0, or center line to each

• Now begin scrolling back through history and watch these centerlines move around in relation to one another

If you have found a way around this please let me know.

Thanks,

Darryl

Hi daimonddbw, thanks for your post. I pleased about your post so we can remove any doubt to anyone. (Hoping that my English is understandable.)

I perfectly understand what you mean but I can assure you that this is not the case as you described for the simple reasons that soon you'll understand.

I have experienced exactly what you're saying on oscillators pairs/combo such as OBV with HPoscillator, or even one of these two with any stochastic or yet others. The result that is obtained is exactly what you described. In fact what you say happens because on these types of oscillators (stochastic and rsi excluded), if now the maximum level is 200 (for example), tomorrow may reach 250, then the graph line is suitable because it is not a line fixed(like every stoch) but a moving line.

In my strategy, we have oscillators that work together in the same way. When they reach the maximum or minimum levels (zero, 100), they remain at these maximum and minimum levels continually banging on them. For example, if today at 9pm my 5,5,1 stochastic is at its maximum, if I return in a month to look at the same situations, I still find the stochastic at the same level.

Look at these examples:

Stoch 12,3,3 / Stoch 14,3,1
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Stoch 12,3,3 / Stoch 14,3,1
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Stoch 5,1,1 / Stoch 12,3,3
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

These will act in the same way even if you apply on them a RSI which also acts exactly like the stochastic.

Please, try by yourself creating this combo(for explanatory purposes): Stoch 5,5,1 + stoch 12,3,1 + RSI 14

I hope I've given you an explanation more than enough, do not hesitate to reply.

Hi Mike,

try this version...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
thanks for sharing guys. i'll try it tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #25 ---
SwingMan  it's almost perfect. Just two things for the correct setup:

Stoch #1 must to be 14,3,1

Stoch#2 must to be 12,3,3 ENABLED

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

try it and then see the winning ratio % difference lol

I just want to thank you.... I am very grateful! As soon I've time I'll rewrite the strategy for you all doing a nice video.

It's not over here!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I'm amazed!     I could have never figured out the math on this myself. This may qualify for a Noble Prize in Economics!!!

Well, I'm not sure about that but I am certain that there is a use for this well thought out and assembled indicator.

btw, does this go in indicators folder or somewhere else? I'm guessing indicators but wanted to be absolutely clear.

Thanks,

Darryl

--- 帖子 #27 ---
- There are a few errors in the indicator (The trading lines are valid only on M1 ... I try to correct).

- It was thought the Stochastic-1 to have as standard, and the Stochastic-2 for test.

Therefore, the default parameters remain, and change in Stochastic-2: enabled = true and limits = 90/10

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Not certain who the developer is. Great explanation by iiMike, however downloads are from SwingMan. Apparently thanks are in order for both of you.

Now the question of using this on time frames other than M1.  I'll have a look myself. Anyone have data related to that yet?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Here the corrected version.

Example: trading on M5 with Expiration = M30

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Perfect, just little thing, like the image I've already post, when you enable the #2 stoch 12,3,3, change upper level to 90 and lower level to 10

Next step, if it's possible, I'd like if this matrix can filter out signal during tokyo and sidney session... and maybe during strong news too...do you think is possible to improve all in this way?

Anyway....thanks for the time that you're dedicating!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
No, no, this is a simple indicator, with a rough statistics...

For binary options you need average gains between 60-70%, better than 70%, otherwise it's not worth it to trade or to further research.

At 60% wins and 80% payout, you not win a lot.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

iiMike & Swingman, are there some limitations that prohibit use of matrix indy on Time Frames above M5? If so can some settings be left blank to enable accurate readings on M15 and above?

The fact that there is now a way to get multiple oscillators working in same subgraph is all I really want to do because Binary is of no interest to me at this time.

If this is not possible please just let me know. I'm not asking anyone to go out of their way to complete any major changes.

Thanks,

Darryl

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Version 3 with Alerts and some improvements.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Done.

Please replace the previous version with this, I made a small adjustment for the time left.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wow! Thanks SwingMan. I appreciate your work.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
• When Red or Green signal lines occur (for short or long), do they paint immediately on signal bar close?

And

• Do they ever repaint during following bar or at anytime?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Please can someone suggest a Good Binary option Broker which offers Demo Account without deposit with 1m-4H timeframe options, wanna try this strategy. Thanks Swingman and the rest, appreciate ur works

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Please test live. I had no time to check ...

Try this: http://www.clmforex.com/

The posted charts are on a demo account.

Big advantage: you can trade Binary Options directly with one EA from Chart! The prices are the Bids, and not (Bid+Ask)/2 as with other brokers. Of course you can also trade forex normal pairs.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Could  you please supply the indicator in MQL. I run MT4 plus 600 and the EX files will not open.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks Swingman, Now I can happily Test your Awesome Strategy with Ease

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Wish there was an easy way to filter out "bad" signals. When a trend is ongoing or just starting, the signals are false. I am not experienced enough to see if I should jump into a trade or if I should stay out.

How do you experienced traders know if it is a go or a no go?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi maxel5700

Thats the 1 mil. quistion you ask . And nobody can give you the answer. Its about to have the right setup and about use the right indicators and the right settings. Atleast if you want to use indicators. It have taken me very long time to put a strategy togehter that give more winning than looser. (see picture below)

So you have a very hard work ahead off you to find your way. But according to what I found I can give you one hint. The standard Bolling Band used here, I am not big fan off. Its give to many false setup. But I am not here to talk BS about this strategy. Just my opinion.

In the picture below you see 5 winning setups. I trade 2 mins exspiry. I only use 3 indicators

I also put up a cable chart first with standard BB settings. See how many false signals. then after that I put up picture with my BB settings see no signals. save me money.

So I hope I give you some ideas about how to make better trades.

And then sorry for typing here in a thread that is not mine. I hope Italian guy will forgive me

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Thanks fratelli :-)

Can I ask you - what are your BB settings, and what time frame are you using?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Maxel

For BB I use 20-3

its 1 mins chart taking 2-5 mins BO exspiry trades

fratelli

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi Fratelli,

Any chance you would start your own tread - explaning your strategy?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I use a really similar strategy and this is one of my favorite! 1 minuteTF, 2 mins trade, BB 25-3 entering at the bands breakout. Still really good on all TF.

Hi Maxel

Long time ago I had a forex thread running here at FF.

It took so much time for me to run it and after some time a lot off BS started in the thread

So at that time I desided never again will I have a thread here in FF.

So my answer is no  Sorry mate

PS Maxel if you smart you know what to do next

Hi there, thanks for the nice thread. I have one question maybe stupid but still learning...pls explain somebody on attache picture I have SwingMans matrix indie and not clear to me one thing, if I  have expiration 5 min and entering after the signal see arrow on the pic, why he is counting 6 candles and not 5. It is a bit confusing to me.

Thanks.

Tea.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Mike pls your uploaded template is not complete could you pls update it. Thanks.

Whats up Team BO

Been testing this out past few nights,

iLMike, how do you avoid or handle scenario such as the ones below. (1MIN TF - 5MIN trades)

Do you continue to keep taking trades consecutively as long as there is a valid signal, or stop after first loss and wait for a new signal 5-10-15 minutes afterwards.

See pics below.

Hi Mojoferrari

Looks like its going well for you.

I`m just using a standard RSI and shoc setting on a 5min chart, so far from 1st Sept I`m up around 45%, lets see how it goes to the end of this month.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hey Sugarman, quit the opposite, on the charts shared above are consecutive losers if you continued to execute the trades.

Can you explain a bit more how you utilize the 5MIN chart and how it helps you when you get the signal on the 1MIN?

Thanks man. (great results on your end)

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I get a signal from a 5 min chart, and trade on a 5 min NOT a 1 min and enter on a BO expiry 5 min.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks man, i'll be trying it out tonight and will post my results for the next two days.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Done for this week, finished +39%.

Trading 6 pairs is too much to keep your eye on, so will cut down to the 3 most profitable pairs next week.

Very nice!

What think you, can a dashboard like this
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...12#post3966112

be useful?

You can make suggestions for the layout...

--- 帖子 #75 ---
such approaches?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
swingman, some trades by session in the indicator is possible to code ?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I do not understand exactly what you want to have ...

The indicator draws signals and displays alarms, and whether you trade or not is a trading problem.

For EAs you can enter the trading times, with indicators I think you do not need this.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
This happens when there is not volatility. Still better during the European session. However, if there are more consecutive signals, enter only at the first. If it goes bad, wait for the next and depending on your MM decide what to do. Try on demo

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Swingman

It`s not something that I would use, maybe for others, thanks anyway.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Great work Sugarman,

What broker are you using (mt4 or mt5)

I have different signals, so was curious to know, thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I`m using MT4 with IG.

Today`s results, 2 wins and 2 losses on eur/usd, 2 losses on usd/jpy and 2 wins and 1 loss on gbp/jpy. If there is a loss on a trade then the next trade I double up,this seems to work well to eliminate the losses and at the same time gets me back into profit.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi guys, this system is the best I have seen in a long time, I have been trading the signals with a demo account and so far not too bad for a Monday, 13 wins 5 losses.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I took a loss on usd/jpy, next trade I`ll double up, by doing this I get back my lost trade and some profit.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Which pairs do you trade? will you double up on the same pair or the next trade?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
trading eur/usd, usd/jpy and gbp/jpy.

only double up on the same pair.

next trade on usd/jpy will be 200 and gbp/jpy 100.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Also what time frame are you on? m1 with 5 min expiry or m5?

I did look at m1 but there were a lot of bad trades.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I agree 1 min too many bad trades, for me trading off 5 min with expiry 5 min works well.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
15min and 30 min expiries seem to work well, I struggle to get in the trades at the right time as I sometimes am not looking at the charts, when it signals its too late as the signal candle is closed and the market has started moving.

It would be great for it to signal when the dotted line appears to give some warning.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Steve, if that works for you then great, we all have our own expiry times to fit around what we do.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Very true

great work.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I decided to do some back testing using only one indicator, there were more signals and with more success. I will still stick to my original and run this along side and keep you updated with my findings.

Not sure what iMike is up too, I don`t want to take his method away, I`m just fine tuning things to my trading style.

Sugarman, can I ask how you work your system? Do you run the charts on 5 min and then place the trades for 5 min expiry? Or do you watch the 1 min. charts?

I used this on 5 min charts, placing trades for 20-30 minute expiry upon receiving the signal. I had about 65% success rate which I think could be improved.

I's appreciate your insight

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hello Sugarman! I'am really appreciate your job here! Could You Tell us about your "only one indicator" used in the last trades?

HI guys, so far 14 wins and 2 losses today. Looks like its the right conditions for this system today.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Great results Steve.

Maybe I have it setup incorrectly, but from what I noticed it does not always reverse straight away. Sometimes it takes 2-3 extra candles before the movement changes direction.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi Mike, I use the second stochastic indicator so it filters out a lot of bad trades.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Great work Steve.

I too have had great results this morning, 2 losses & 10 wins all on 5 min charts.

The only indicator I`m using is a single shoc, not even looking at a chart.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Thanks, I double checked my parameters for my second stochastic indicator and I had it setup incorrectly.  When I enabled it the signals started to look more promising

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Stochastics can be good but you can get many bad signals from them especially when there is divergence.

But then again it depends on how you use it, it sounds like you have it down to a fine art.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I hope so.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
make that 12 wins.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
blimey!  I'm definitely doing something wrong   Even after double checking the matrix settings, it looks like it takes two bars after the signal for the price to move in the right direction.

You know that success rate that shows up at the top right corner on MT4? What does it show for you? For me it ranges between 50 - 60% for different pairs on 5m charts.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Mike, as I mentioned in my previous posts, I`m not using any matrix, dashboards etc. I have one indicator, a set of shocs on a 5 min chart and that`s it, keep it clear and simple.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
And here I was thinking you're talking about the "Italian Job" system

Thank you sugarman.  I wonder if I can replicate these signals on my MT4. I'll have to look at that tonight.  In theory if I use same settings for the stochastic it should fire up the signal on the same time right?  I see ilMike used two sets of stochastics for the matrix,  12,3,3 and 14,3,1.  Do you have yours set the same? Thanks.

Markets World provides demo accounts but they are not the same expiry system as a spot or tech fin broker.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I would recommend everyone to visit the site 'BinaryOptionsThatSuck.Com'.

There you will find reviews about a lot of brokers, and believe me, there are A LOT OF 'scam' ones  between them.

I'm not sure, but I believe 'Banc de Binary' has no good reputation.

GOption has a rating there of 6,8/10, not very good either.

Just read the reviews before you subscribe with a broker and do read the reactions of ordinary people like you and me ...

Okay i read the thread : use clmforex

For demo trading use marketsworld.com - they dont call you all day long.

For live i use stockpair and ig. - I've used them both for a longer time.

Thanks sugarman,  I took it as a signal and placed the trade as well. And yes, it was a winner.

I'm still confused though - what generated the signal?  That red line on your charts - where does it come from?   Stochastic indicator on its own doesn't do it, does it?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Mike

The red line is something I put on to show you that I`m trading the next bar, this line has nothing to do with the stochastic.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Aaaha!  So you just watch the stochastics to get over 90 or below 10 and then place the trade on the 5min candle close?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
something like that, keeps it clean, simple and effective.

Before Mike started this thread I was playing around the RSI and stochs, now I find just the stochs is enough, well it works for me.

Thanks. I missed the EU trade, went out for lunch  Good to see it win.  How do you filter out the fake signals. And how do you decide what candle to enter the trade? If I look at the trade you took, why this candle and not the one before for example? I might wait until the stoch lines close up or cross over, but by that time it might be too late to enter the trade? :-o

Morning All

Trading from 08.00 based on IG`s opening time to 15.30 (15.30 close this works around my day job) based on an open trade of £50 if the first trade is a loss I double next etc.

This weeks total comes in at +£2088.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Have you had 4 or more consecutive losses since you started utilising this system?

The results look awesome.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
The danger of this "system" without a filter is that in a strong trend markets can stay overbought and oversold for long periods of time. Of course with a reasonable stop loss and money management you should be able to circumvent this problem.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I start out at £50, then double each trade until I get a winner, so answering your question yes I have got 4 losses which means that the next trade is £800 but the return is £650.

So to calculate, minus £50 + £100 + £200 + £400 = minus £750 + £650 on my £800 trade, loss £100. The 4 consecutive losses has happened once in the last 5 months.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
You are right. Any suggestions?

(SL and MM are not applicable for BO!)

Here the matrix version 4, with signals according to sugarman settings.

Also an indicator to analyse the stochastic tresholds.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
handy

as swingman has mentioned there is no SL with BO, MM would be considered as to the size of your trade.

If the market stays in over sold / bought why does that matter, you are only taking one trade per stochastic trigger. When it comes out of these areas and goes back in that`s when I would re-enter.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Nice work people, including you Sugarman, really impressed. More Grease to ya Elbows.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Just an idea: One might have a better chance when one would be trading pullbacks rather than countertrend trades.

So, the overbought/oversold condition at 1 minute time frame would result in the alignment to the, say, 5 minute timeframe (TF) trend.

For example, one would enter a sell/put if and only if the trend at the 5 minute TF is down (say, price below a certain EMA(X) at 5 minute TF or, equivalently, below an EMA(5*X) on the 1 minute TF) and the 1 minute signal is overbought.

I am sure that this would decrease the number of trades, but I think it might increase the probability of being ITM...

Cheers,

kprsa

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Are you using 20/80 or 10/90 now as levels??

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hmm, nice Swingman.

Here is my little contribution. On the M1 chart you will see also a nonlag stoch, which I find much better than an ordinary stoch.

There is also a nonlag M5 stoch in the same window.

So, it's also MTF and has alerts ...and of course, NRP !

Enjoy and cheers.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Thanks for sharing , so we can say its a consistently profitable strategy.

Are you using stoch 5 and 95 levels for the signal and nothing else?

Sugar; could you please tell more about your strategy. Hos do you trigger a signal,  and how do you get through overbougt/sold with one main line stoch. Thanks.

@sugarman :Can i just clarify that once the stoch crosses the 90 line ,we place PUT on the open of the next candle.When the stoch crosses the 20 down we place a CALL on the open of the next candle.It that it?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Dear SwingMan,

Your alarm for the signal is set 5 second left on the 5 min bar, can you move that to 30 secs or 1 min prior to the expiry time so I will have more time to set up the broker?

I don't mind if the signal disappears afterward, but it would give us time to prepare.

Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
An interesting request!

The signals appear when a new bar appears, and that is never exactly at mm:00 clock, but often a few seconds later.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
My Humble contribution to the thread. please swing man, dont know if this indicator helps, but i think incorporating it to the system will improve our winning Rate

--- 帖子 #252 ---
i plan on improving the system to have atleast a 90% win rate, not good with programing to incorporate indicators together which is really a stumbling block for me

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Mr SwingMan,

My broker is slightly behind in timing with the MT4 platform, that's why it seems like its 3 secs behind.

My question is that there should be a way to set up an alarm when the top arrow appears. (##SIGNAL##)

I know you will find the way.

Thank you

Francisakz, you talked about a combination of indicators that is good for binaries. Do you mind sharing your idea? Meanwhile you have a PM

--- 帖子 #290 ---
The problem with the stochastic in oversold or overbought areas is that if you are trading countertrades, several candles continue the trend before an opposite trend takes place.

Here is a simple histogram indicator with consideration of the trigger line.

The colors of the histograms changes only if the difference Stochastic/Trigger exceeds a threshold value (2% as example).

The thin vertical lines show the signal bars.

In overbought area the signal histogram should/can be below the upper level (90), and in oversold area above the lower level (10).

Unfortunately, also in this case not all next bars are in profit (5 min expiration), but there are also very few more as 4, so that you can earn something with martingale ...

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I like your results Sugarman, but I went through all your posts and posted charts and I see that yours entries are often discretional.

Manytimes you do not entry on the first stochastic touch of the 0-100 level, but 1-2 bar later.

So what is your clue for filtering stoch's signals?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Nice one, SwingMan, I will try your indicators right away.

One of my hobbies is testing indicators ...

So, a lot are thrown away after testing, if it repaints, I know it very fast.

If it's a good one, I might 'use' it for some time and discard it after a while.

But the next I'll always use ...

SoI have a little present which could be of use. This is a very good MACD, but without histogram.

It's two colored, NRP and of course it has a MA which indicates the 'trend'.

You can't really call a trend on M1 a 'trend', but a trend is a trend ...

You will see what I mean when you look at the picture of my chart.

A stoch will, in a very long upward trend, do strange things (moving up or down the 80 level, so giving false signals) it's the nature of a stoch, but this MACD compensates for that.

I admire Sugarman for trading only with one indicator, a stoch, but I would never do that.

On the other hand, maybe I use too many indicators ...

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks for posting a potential bo setup. But why are you going against the trend? When ma is blue only look for uptrend setups.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi colombino

I can assure you that my entries are NOT discretional, there`s no filtering just working purely off the stochastic signal.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
With safety, it is so!

With the histograms you can well identify retracements and then trade in trend direction...

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Ahh, now i see ;-)

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi Swingman

No problems for me if its over sold /bought and it continues several candles in the same area, I only take one trade per over sold / bought.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi Wulong

Working with one indicator is simple, clean and effective. At the end of the day if you use one or many indicators you are not going to win 100%, all systems will fail at some point, fact. My only edge if I get a looser I double the next trade, so I cant loose in the long term.

--- 帖子 #299 ---

--- 帖子 #301 ---
That really depend on how much you are risking per trade, og how strong the trend is.

I was testing your setup last night, and i added a rsi 4 - It filtered out alot of bad trades. And then i used the stoch 14.3.3 but WITH the signal line, that way i can use the stoch cross as trigger.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Actually, I would suggest completely the opposite conclusion for this money management strategy. After several losing trades in a row, this is certain to blow your account. It is easy to calculate what the probability of such catastrophic event is, given the winning probability and the percentage of your account you spend on one trade.

Imagine you have a 70% winning ratio (i.e. the probability of a losing trade is 30%) and that you always use 10% of your account to place the initial trade. It takes about four losing trades to wipe your account (you risk 10%, then after the first loss 20%, then 40% and then the rest, since you don't have 80% anymore, but just 30%). The probability for this to happen is (0.3*0.3*0.3*0.3)=0.0081=0.81 %, so this is about 1 in a 100 event, not particularly infrequent.

I agree so far today 7 wins 0 losses on EU today.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I`m done for another day, so far this week +£788 but have 2 trades at stage 2, so figure could read +£988 if these were not at stage 2.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Thats really good mate, I'm only up £86 so far today but still testing the italianjob system so playing it safe.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
nice one Steve, you trading on 1 min or 5 min or neither?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
That`s great trading especially with only one pair, I`m back to 6 pairs.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Yeah I have found that it works best on EU so sticking to that for now, lots of potential though.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi, thx for nice, easy and very profitable system, this is my result for this afternoon, as stevek11 said, best results on EU.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I use 5 min expiry, how does the 60s expiry work for you? Have you been using this system for long?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I'm using this system almost from beginning, but I made some imrovements with some more indicators, but today a tried new one from SwingMan and it works just great. I tried 2min exp. and 90sec., but best results for me is on 60sec. exp. I made trades to trend, but with stochastic also against the trend, main rule is just wait for the right momment :-D sry I just joking...the point is to be patient

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I think you did very well applied Mike's strategy!

Concerning the Indicators:

- The additional stochastic you do not need because you have the Stochastic Histogram.

- BBRSI and BBand might bring little informations.

- Very good that you use the Suport-Resistance lines (always check HH and LL)!

Just try to test the posted DoubleSmoothed Average. In the default setting is almost identical to the smoothed HeikinAshi Average. It helps visually very well when deciding whether to trade with or against the trend ...

If you have patience :nerd: and focused only on three indicators, one can be successful. Anyway, on M1 you have to make decisions quickly, and you do that very well today

--- 帖子 #329 ---
thx SwingMan :-) I set up 2 rules for opening possition which I'm using to make  decisions quickly, so I just looking to price to search this rules and when its there I'm in :-) I hope this will works as nice as yeasterday

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Interesting. As sugarman can you describe us please the rules and post from time to time some charts. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Swingman

Basic rules, when the stochastic is over bought both signal and stoch, I would sell, opposite for buy.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Just an idea for "quick trading" execution.

With the broker CoreLiquidity (clmforex), StarfishFX and few other you can trade BO directly from the chart. At CL as example, the BO price is identical with the Bid price, so that you can trade the signals 1:1. Additionally, you can also trade BOs with EAs...

Hi sugarman,

Since the beginning of the thread i read all your post. Very interesting and your account management still to be strong.

I trade BO with IG and i just have 1 question: what are your level alert of your stoch ? I can't read it on your charts.

I think it's 90/10 or 99/1 ?

Thank for your help!

Wish you the best,

JB.

what`s your stoch setting, make sure it`s 14.3.3

--- 帖子 #349 ---
yep 14.3.3 levels 5 and 95

--- 帖子 #350 ---
that is weird, I`m trading on MT4 and mine was below 5.

I have two different mt4 platforms on the go and both were at around 13, very weird, oh well..

Mine as well @ around 13

Yes, but your secret setting is the price field...

It seems that this is much better for BO as Low/High, congratulation .

no secret swingman, I presume everybody was on the same setting.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
How long have you been using this system? is it profitable? It would be nice to make some consistent profit?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
last week was about £2k, from Monday to now up £1388.

Ahh it makes sense now, however it does create lots of false signals on GU today.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
4 wins out of 4 for me on GU today.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
The red lines are where you could have entered

--- 帖子 #362 ---
steve, they are not my entry points that would have been 4 losses.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
That's what I mean, why wouldn't you enter there, the stoch is bellow 5 and above 95?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
steve, I have a sell signal on usd / cad, I will not take as news is out in 5 mins and I wouldn`t recommend anybody else to take.

I`m done for today,tomorrow day off.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Ok sugarman, thanks for the help buddy.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
would have been a winner.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hi Sugarman, what pairs are you using?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Is there someone out with a good broker.

I tried CoreLiquidity and StarfishFX but they offer only 75% Return on 5min expiry time. I can only find 4 or five pairs with IG for 5mins. My current broker binary.com offers up to 110% but today, once a valid signal came up, has always been below 80%.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Well I tried to replicate Sugarman's approach and backtest it and I found that without his martingale it is not tradeable in the long term.

For example 5min e/u 19.-23.9. was 17W vs 20 L with killing 6 loses in a row - as you can see in the screenshot (winner are singleline, losers double line)

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I think Sugarman takes his trades once both the main and signal line crosses the 95-5 levels. So that would be 2 bars after yours and would be all winners.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hope everyone wasprofitable today, Had 11 Trades all wins no Loss today, wish it continues like this forever. begining to love this system

what are you talking about, it`s not tradeable in the long term. All I can say is yesterday I had 15 wins out of 15. I have been trading this way for the last 5 months and the worst week I`ve had is +£35 and the best £2956.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Sir, what is the secret behind this  ( successful) awesome result....

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Morning All, I`m not trading today.

just keep your eye on UC there may be a potential buy,on the 08.10 bar.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Its a mix in here, some are Trading the matrix system located at start of the thread, others are Trading the stoch oversold/bought.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi SwingMan,

Have you created any EA for MT4 to trade binary options? If, so ... then, how did you resolve the issue of OrderSend - function

... to deal with CALL / PUT input (instead of OP_BUY / OP_SELL) ... as well as selecting the specific Option Expiry (60s or 5m)

I've been looking for some coding examples for a while ... and ... unfortunately couldn't find anything helpful.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Sure, I'm not saying that you are not in profit and succesful. Sure you use some discretion to choose your trades. I was only trying to replicate your trading strategy, so I took every single trade according the informations you gave us and your charts examples (Stoch 14,3,3, close, close, must be over 5/95 line, signal line too).

With this approach I would be in these days on euro in red numbers, with the martingale even worse.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Well martingale is always bad. No matter what. It´s just a mathematical fact. Even with a 70% SR a 6-8 or even worse run of consecutive losses will come sooner or later and kill the bank. I don´t know why sugarman does use martingale if he has such high number of winners. I have a sportsbetting background and one thing´s for sure. I martingale does not make a losing system win but makes a winning system lose.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I know ...

Here the only example that many months ago was on a site of CL ...

The order send trick is to set "EaName:seconds", for example "EaName:60" or "EaName:300" etc.

At CL the price is always the Bid .

But I have not yet made ​​an EA to run properly at CL...

--- 帖子 #383 ---
It seems that you MUST write "BO exp:60" or "BO exp:300" etc., but I do not know why.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Swing man please I need ur help please, can u please help me add an Alert to the Mbfx timing indicator whenever it changes color, please man will be grateful

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Thank you SwingMan, I'll have a look inside that script and try to implement into some simple EA (just for execution testing)

and let you know about the outcome.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
there we go again, martingale, where in my posts have I said I`m using martingale, please please show me.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Ok, then I did not remember correctly. I thought you increased your stake after a loss. My bad (Maybe I just listened to the guy who posted the chart few comments back).

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi Sugarman, forgive a newbie jumping in but I only found this thread yesterday and read the entire 19 pages so everything is fresh in my mind and you DID say that after a losing trade you placed another higher trade on the same asset to recoup your losses and get into profit. Which is why people are thinking you are trading martingale.

You said "If the market stays in over sold / bought why does that matter, you are only taking one trade per stochastic trigger. When it comes out of these areas and goes back in that`s when I would re-enter".

So if I've understood correctly, you're not doubling up immediately, i.e. the next 5 minute period after a losing trade, you're waiting for the next time that asset is triggered which may be hours later and THEN you're doubling up.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Further to my last post, in Sugarman's images the stoch looks to be a single line but mine is double. Is that just the image quality or do I need to alter something to merge it into a single line? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I don't know much about he indicators but one is called main line and the other is the signal line.

Sugarman did mention that he waits till both lines are above/below 95/5 stoch levels.

Thats my understanding. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
lol

martingale = increasing stake after a loss, no matter if double, triple or half.

So I was right???

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Yes!  You were right! , lets say.... So what. The guy says he's making money. Good on him.

If you don't like the way he trades you are free to trade the way you want.

Of course by all means raise these issues for newbies to learn and practice on a demo account.

I think there's no point for a who can piss further kinda discussion here.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Thanks. I'm looking at the indicators now and Sugarman's images look to only have the main line and not the dotted signal line. So I'm confused as to how he waits until both lines are above/below if he's only using the main line. Unless the dotted signal line doesn't show up in a screen shot. But yes, that's my understanding also, that you wait for BOTH lines to cross.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Not that I'm setting myself up as Sugarman's spokeswoman here but I think the confusion is down to the differing interpretations of what constitutes martingaling. In binary options it's generally considered to be doubling up immediately on a losing trade. Sugarman IS doubling up and I would still personally call it martingaling but obviously he doesn't because he's waiting for the next trade set-up on that currency pair. So if the next set-up on that pair doesn't come until hours later or even the next day, that's when he doubles up. And if that trade loses, he doubles up again when the next set-up comes around (on the same currency pair). So his form of martingaling could take days to complete.

My opinion is that any form of doubling up is martingaling but as has been said, if he's happy and it works for him, good luck to him. I don't have the stomach for it myself.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Yeah, if it works for him, it´s fine. Actually, I wish everybody wealth, health and happiness.  But giving out a warning is not to make his "strategy" down but to warn/explain to others what it can do. Tha was actually my only purpose.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Alright, back to topic.

I now did a little manual backtest on the Stoch 14,3,3. No matrix, just Stoch closing over 95/under 5. Both lines. So far, the first 200 setups have produced 148 wins, meaning 74% SR.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Bad day, Lost $18 today, cos of my carelessness. Hope for better days

--- 帖子 #398 ---
sorry sugarmna, i dont want to get in fight with you, you take it too much personaly, i love your trading staly and just want to find the way how to implement it properly. About the martingale you were talking in posts 218 and 221

"I start out at £50, then double each trade until I get a winner, so answering your question yes I have got 4 losses which means that the next trade is £800 but the return is £650.

So to calculate, minus £50 + £100 + £200 + £400 = minus £750 + £650 on my £800 trade, loss £100. The 4 consecutive losses has happened once in the last 5 months. "

which pairs and dates you were backtesting? On euro today I found 15w/10l =60%

19.-23.9.(roughly) 17w/20L

So, I should be missing some sugarmans settings (stoch 14,3,3,close,close,both lines over 5-95%) or some sugarmans discretion.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
That's excellent! What I've noticed from posts in this thread and my own experience is that different platforms seem to give vastly different Stoch values, even using the same 14,3,3 settings, which is bound to create totally different results.

I'm currently comparing my MT4 charts with Freestockcharts and using the same settings the Stoch curves are identical on both charts but the values are very different. On MT4 I'd have lots more trades than with Freestockcharts, where it's very rare for both the main and the signal line to be above/below 95/5. I've played around with the "close/close" and "low/high" price field settings on MT4 (which Freestockcharts doesn't have) and it makes no difference. There are still way more trades with MT4 whatever the setting.

I also find it really difficult to see where the Stoch crosses the line on the MT4 charts and the font showing the values is so tiny I can barely read it. I find Freestockharts much easier when viewing a few charts at once but I'm a bit concerned about the discrepancy in the values. Doing some backtesting the results look really good but if I'm going to use Freestockcharts, which I prefer, I'm going to need a lot of patience as there seems to be so few qualifying set-ups.

Apart from my visual preference for Freestockcharts, the price feed is usually really close to that of my broker whereas the MT4 platform is way off. Not sure whether that makes any difference to trade results.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Just wanted to share a shot of why I prefer Freestockcharts. I can scan all my broker's currency pairs at once and the Stoch value is clearly visible on each chart. Once it gets close to a set-up I can maximise the chart.

Francisakz..losses are part of it bro...better luck next time...Plz can you tell us how u use your MB indicator and wat tf u use and how long you hold?

Guys, Steve mentioned a thing about having different signals on mt4 with that of sugarman...think he gets better signals coz at some point his signal was below 5 and all ours were above 13..

Guys due to a random walk of prices especially at a low tfs as 5min, am sure it will not take that long for sugarman to recover and make a profit coz if he takes only one ob/os signal. i just wish my mt4 was reading the same with his...psycologically tht wud be a thumbs up....i hope to do exactly wt sugar is doing on a live test of $100 with a starting bet of $1 and see how it goes..

Gudluck guys and lets keep brainstorming....this stuff is better than my addiction, sports gaming..lol

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I've realised that the main line always hits the 95/5 before and more often than the signal line and that the signal line is never at 95/5 without the main line. So I've blacked out the main line on my charts so I only have the signal line to focus on which makes spotting set-ups much easier. If anyone wants to use Freestockcharts here's a link to my set-up. You can change the currency pairs to those offered by your own broker (I'm using Stockpair). http://www.freestockcharts.com?email...f-b68a59151606

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I have now backtestet it even further. 8 hrs in a row, so not sure if everything is in.

Obv problems, different brokers have different history, thats why even with the same settings the stoch might cross or not. Also you may get unlucky when there is almost no movement (and your broker says lost even though the candle may have gone in your direction on the chart).

Overall (EUR; USD; JPY; GPB; AUD; CAD) all pairs combines (e.g. EUR/USD; EUR/JPY; GPB/USD ...) M5, expiry time 5min

4755 total entries 2553 wins/2202 losses -- SR: 53,70%

--- 帖子 #406 ---
The results can fit ...

You can save a little time with this indicator:

--- 帖子 #407 ---
8 hours? Is that a typo? I backtested Friday on 11 currency pairs and only got about 10 trade set-ups. In total. Not per pair.  Did you mean 8 weeks?

I'm guessing if you went back weeks you just checked every trade whereas in real trading conditions you'd avoid news releases, market openings and suchlike. And you'd probably avoid trading a pair for which the market was closed. So all that would drag down the results.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
To find all the setups took me 8hrs, data is from 2014 only. I´ll finish putting them all in my staking machine tomorrow. By then I can say if there were differences in London, NY or Tokio sessions for the pairs.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Alright, so yeah, the results seem pretty identical. Losing runs of 14, 12, 9 (twice), 8 (thrice) and 7 (thrice) can really crush your bankroll if you increase stakes.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Are the results based on the green/red arrows below the stoch lines? If so, it's throwing up tons of false signals where the magenta signal line isn't above/below 95/5. If the backtesting is purely based on the blue stoch line then that's not the system, which requires BOTH lines to be above/below.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Here's a screenshot of the stochastic signal line for the entire trading day of 26 Sept for the EUR/USD to compare with Swingman's shot of the same day. The green line is 95 and the red is 5. As you can see, there wasn't a single valid trade entry all day as the signal line didn't once touch 95 or 5.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Any "martingale" type system is fraught with danger. A Las Vegas casino reported that once red came up 41 consecutive times. You'd need a hell of a big wedge of money to martingale that and come out break-even or ahead.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
yep, you are right, there are more then dozen far more superior progressions then martingale for even money bets, wich will not destroy your account after 6 or 10 loses in a row, i think everyone who who was ever interested in this field knows them, but from matematical point of view non of them will you give any advantage in the long therm, so using them is nonsens, on forex or on the roulette.

On the first sight it can looks like that the progression is giving you more money than trading with ordinary trading style, because its helps you quickly recover your loses with newcoming wins, but when you will take in consideration the big loses it can bring you with statistical certainty and first of all - the need to lower your bets to help you overcome the increase of bets with the losing streak, then you will realise than its a zero-zero game in comparison with betting constant higher bets without the progression.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Please download the latest version_2 of the signal indicator.

You can also test a single day to better compare different brokers.

Here is an example with Stoch = 13,8,8 and expiration = M15

The results are calculated on a EURUSD-BO pair and are a bit better than on EURUSD at the same broker.

Hi swingman, thank you for the update, is there any way you can program in a trading time for the signals, for example I only want to trade from 8am gmt til 9pm gmt, this way I can see the real percentage of winning trades within those hours.

If you have a sell signal and volume is red it is safe and if it is a buy signal volume must be green, this gets rid of a lot of false signals.

Well done sugarman! Hope your trade on USD/CAD was a good one !

I don't know really who you filter your trade just with your stoch only (level 95/5)...but your results are brilliant.

I think you had already answer to this question but what if you loose a trade ? For example if your first trade was a 20$ bet but unfortunately you loose this one, your second trade is a 40$ bet ?

Hi jb

That`s absolutley correct. One indicator is enough for me, like any other system /method it will loose and win.

Can i ask you what is your broker ? (just to compare my data with the data from your broker). Sometimes my stoch value is different: i touch the 95 or 5 level line but apparently you didn't touch the line on the same time.

according to the results from swingman indicator " bosugerman" signal , on us/cad there were 15 consecutive losses with this method, is this possible? if you double up this would wipe out account?

Nice and wonderful Entry Strategy

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Please everybody, forget about martingale. It will sooner or later wipe out your account because you cannot beat this mathematically unless you have infinite money and stakes. Just search it, progression is not a BRM. Beware of that.

If you cannot beat it with level stakes, then you should give up on it anyway.

If you beat it with level stakes, you will ruin your efforts with martingale.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
he is only using your stoch , nothing else, this is more alarm then indic. maybe because you only trade UK hours , you have less losses?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I ask because what I've noticed is that often by the time the trigger candle closes, the stoch value has crossed back above/below 5 or 95, leaving me unsure whether to still take the trade.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Oh and by the way Sugarman, you probably know this already as an ig.com user. I've set alerts for all my currency pairs to notify me when the stochastic 14.3.3. signal line is above/below 94/6. Helps enormously with the eye strain of staring at the charts.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
You don't have to strain your eyes - the data window in mt4 will tell you all you need to know.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
that`s great can you please let me know how you set your alarm.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Your right, martingale will kill your account.

nervesof and sugarman: i'm a french trader (so i trade the london session). Because of the strategy is very simple (just stochastic indi), why can we not set an EA to open the trade automatically ?

I think it would be great. What do you think about that ?

I don't know if IG.com allow to trade with EA for binary option ?

It work... but is not an EA.

Perhaps one should avoid overlapping signals!

The number of entrys is about the same, and therefore different expirations not affect the number of signals.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hello swingman, i think the signals would have been better if the alert comes when the stochastics for example cross 95 line down or 5 line up. Please could you make sstoch indicator with what i described? Thanks in advance.

Hi Sugarman, are you using IG to place your trades and using 4 pairs

--- 帖子 #483 ---
trading 6 pairs with IG.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi sugarman, what is the max consecutive losses that you had on 1 pair?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
it was I think 4 that was 5 months ago, even if it goes to 8 that would only be 5% of my account.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
8 losses would be 13000 , so your account should be 250000 ? if this method makes a 8000 profit /month , this is a 3% profit?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
The size of my account is no where near that.

Your maths is wrong, 8 losses is 6400.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
50+100+200+400+800+1600+3200+6400 = 12750  if you loose 8, this is the total loss ?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
you havent added back the winning trade after 8 losses.

you are right , but you wrote that 8 losses would be less then 5% of your account, from there my calculation.

I appreciate very much all your help and system, just need to know  how much capital is needed not to bust it

in case I am ready to take max 5 losses (as you never had more than 4) a capital of 4000 would seem apropriate ,

with possibilty to loose 1600 on loosing streak from 5 and begin again. Am I correct?

thanks again.

why not start off with a small account, start with £5 take a loss and start again with £5. I double up as this works for me.

Good. That's what I thought, although in this case the 2nd trade would've been a winner also. But glad to hear you only take 1 trade as I've noticed in a pronounced down/up trend the stochastic can remain "in the zone" for quite some time.

that`s correct, could really do without the doubling up but its the only way to recoup my losses.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I have an account with them and IG, but FXDD charts are more accurate than some other brokers.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Great, thanks. I get that it works for you but as a newbie to this strategy (which I really like, btw) I need to build up my confidence. In your experience can I still make money with the following strategy. Each day, stop after 3 losing trades or 1 losing trade after 3 or more winners. So however many winners in a row, I'd keep going but once I exceeded 3 winners, stop for the day on the next losing trade. Today I'm 3-3 so am stopping. So, can I still be profitable, do you think?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Everybody has their own limit and MM, that is very important. I really cannot advise you, it`s what ever you are comfortable with, I think what you have mentioned here go with that until you build your confidence, only you will know.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
congrats on ur trading sugarman....looking at ur stochs and the trigger candle it shows that there were a couple of candles already touching the 95 level before the candle u used as trigger...as per ur method u take trades as soon as the candle that touching the 95 o 5 level closes...am I missing something...I have backtested and on quite a number of occasions the stoch stays at the 5 and 95 level for a while...please could u elaborate on that. I have marked with the black horizontal line where the candles were touching the 95 stochs level.

Regards

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Dennis: I think you should download BO Signal V3 (made by Swingman here) for backtesting. It will be more accurate

Nervesof: I am trying to plan a MM strategy about sugarman's system which could be profitable if there is no more 4 losses in a raw. Because i think we don't need to risk our capital with a bad martinguale if it happen in the future 10 or more consecutive losses on a pair...

Sugarman said that he had no more than 4 consecutives losses in a raw in the past 5 month. So i think it could be profitable with good MM to stop the martinguale at 4 consecutives losses max.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Maybe sugarman can post his stoch indicator. I don´t get the same entreis as him even with the same broker. Standard MT4 Stoch is almost always around 90 or 10, when sugarman posts entries. Actually those that do reach my 5/95 line produce 54% only since Aug 14 on major 10 Pairs.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
SeeTheStars: Do you set your stoch indi with the good settings ? (Level 95/5, 14,3,3 and Close/Close - Simple) ?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Please stop. Would you never use martingale. Even if sugarman has had success with his martingale and had no more than 4 losses. That is pretty lucky. Mathematically, using a martingale is never +ev unless you have unlimited capital and stakes. Sooner or later, it will hit you.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
SeaTheStars, i'm just interesting by the strategy. Only demo. I never use - never will - use a martinguale on my live account .

--- 帖子 #536 ---
The stoch indicator is the standard one in MT4, nothing fancy just set to 14.3.3 and levels 95 / 5, that`s it simple. I cant understand why some people cannot use it, maybe they should stick to Mike`s original method on his first post.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
You may as well say that trading is a game of luck, all methods / systems will fail at some point, fact.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
no your not missing something, maybe as SeaTheStars puts it "I`m just pretty lucky".

--- 帖子 #539 ---
my lucky trades have performed well today,+£683 over 6 pairs.

so that`s £2071 for the week, what do you reckon SeaTheStars, another lucky week.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hi Dennis, I'm obviously not Sugarman but looking at my own MT4 chart I can tell you that in the two instances you mention, the signal line hadn't broken 95 in either case. At 13.00 (the candle before Sugarman's entry) the signal value was 94.6919 (although the main value was 96.6377) and at 14.25 the signal value was 92.5417, even though the main value was 100. The candles he entered on were the first ones where the signal value (which always breaches 95/5 later than the main value) had exceeded 95. Of course, on your MT4 platform it could be that the signal line had broken 95 on the candles you're referring to, since there does seem to be quite a bit of divergence from platform to platform.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I may have an explanation for the 54%, but please correct me if I'm wrong. It sometimes happens that the Stoch remains outside 95/5 for several consecutive candles. So if it stayed outside for 3 candles with no price reversal, wouldn't your backtesting give 3 losing trades? With Sugarman's system you'd only have 1 losing trade because he doesn't take the same overbought/oversold set-up more than once.

If I'm right and you were to deduct all the additional losing trades created by the same set-up, that could seriously improve the statistics.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
this gbp/jpy at 13.45 should have been a loss and taken at 13.40 , was there a reson you delayed , or you just missed it?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Forgive me for jumping in again and replying to a question to sugar man but as I'm trading this system myself I'm keen to check on any winners of his that may have turned out to be losers for me so if I'm checking my charts anyway it makes sense to share my findings. At 13.40 the signal line was at 4.6155 but the main line was at 5.7461 (unusual, it's normally the main line exceeds the value first) so it was still no trade (on my platform which is FXPro and luckily seems to correspond to sugarman's in most cases).

At 13.45 the main line was at 3.8168 and the signal line at 4.4597 so this was the first candle close where the parameters were met and it was a winning trade.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I appreciate your input , as I also want to go live with this system , clarity is very important.

I am using FXDD (same as sugerman), and as you can see the main line was under 5 allready at 13.30!! so this is not the reason. Obviously , Sugarman  must use signal line (he never gave this detail , a screanshot from his stoch input would be very helpfull), and still this signal was delayed.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Obviously I don't want to go back over 28 pages of this thread but as I only learned about this strategy here  from Sugarman and I knew that both the main line and the signal line have to be outside 95/5 then he must have mentioned it at some point or how would I know?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Actually, it's easy to search through the posts so here you go vanupips, I've copied and pasted where Sugarman talked about the signal line. I can kind of see why he gets impatient with questions that he's already answered. (No offence intended to you vanu).

--- 帖子 #550 ---
One point is causing this confusion I believe.

We are looking at the history, ie the candle has formed and closed, stoch value for that candle determined and already painted however we are missing the fact that during the formation of a candle stoch repaints like every other indi, so during this period of time before the candle closes the values of the main line and the signal line may as well be over/below the specified parameters.

We don't know if for Sugarman this is a valid signal or he only considers the stoch values after the candle close.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Not always, but that's another approach. In a strong trending market even if you use 30 min expiry you'll lose.

No strategy is fool proof.

If somebody has got time in their hands and compares both 5 and 30 min expiry results that might give an idea.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
your option should always be bearish movement in Strong bearish trends, if you attempt bullish movements, you will always be cut off. atleast this will reduce the loss

--- 帖子 #553 ---
He probably didn't reply to you because he'd already replied 5 days earlier to Swingman (see below). He must have the patience of a saint answering the same questions over and over again. I'm really interested in this strategy so I have read this entire thread 3 or 4 times to make sure I haven't missed anything. Maybe you could do the same.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
sugarman never directly answered this in detail.

If you look at the images of the charts that sugarman posted - zoom in really big - there is only 1 one stochastic line.

sugarman correct me if I'm wrong but, when you mention "over bought both signal and stoch" you mean "signal " the candle and/or the 95/5 stoch levels.

When you mention "over bought both signal and stoch" you mean the stochastic line.

Reading the whole thread, over and over, that is my understanding of it.

sugarman please reply - are you using the stochastic main or signal line? from your attached images you are not using both!

Hi Steve

No chance I run my own business, trading is a side line.

However saying that aside, I`m getting to the point that if this continues for a further 12 months then I may go full time.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Was just clarifying that if you lose a put trade you then wait for a call trade to double up on.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I also run my own business but dont always have a full day to trade with so its quite difficult to make consistent profits.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Myself on and off roughly 5 years of trading, this for me by far is the best system.

Nervesof (steel) please do butt in, as long as we all get all then that`s great.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Steve this is what I do, please don`t follow me if you feel uncomfortable.

Lets take this as an example, we are in the over sold area,I take a buy trade and it looses, now if the market moves out of the over sold and then moves back in, I will buy again, make sense?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Sorry let me just clarify the last paragragh.

When I say the market moves out of the over sold area I mean the end of the next candle.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Steve and Nervesof, I`m off for a glass of wine you guys have a great weekend, speak on Monday.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Ok thanks sugarman, have a good one bud.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
That's very good advice, Francis. In my short time of studying and trading this system I've noted that the times when the Stoch remains overbought/sold for several candles at a time are during a strong trend. However, I wouldn't be averse to taking a 5-minute reversal trade if the trend appeared to be pausing for breath.

Another thing I won't do (although I know Sugarman does this) is to take 2 trades simultaneously. Firstly because it's not possible to enter 2 trades EXACTLY on the opening of the next candle (however fast you are on the trigger) and secondly because if 2 pairs qualify for a trade at just the same time then they're either correlating or non-correlating, meaning you're pretty much taking the same trade with double the risk. 99% of the time both trades will either win or both will lose.

--- 帖子 #582 ---

--- 帖子 #584 ---
facepalm sugarman.

I dont say your trades are lucky, but only having 4 losses in a row at maximum is lucky. You got it wrong. Even with 70% winrate, or whatever yours is, a 5 games losing run happens once every 400 trades.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Ok, apparently, when you hit the 20K profit border, you get blocked @ binary. Any other broker out there with up to 100% return?

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Have backtested different things. Expiry 5m up to 1h seems to be pretty even throughout. So, if it has 55% on 5m is also seems to be in that % range after 30m or 1h.

Well, I am also still unsure of what he uses. Granted, I bet on sports for 14hrs a day so my brain cannot pick up all the things hereTrading signal line only is @54% in the last 5 months but sugarman has successfully traded it. I used the same MT4 broker for backtesting (and yes, only 1 max. entry for one overbought/oversold area). I don´t know why there is such a gap as backtesting this should be pretty easy.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
What do you mean with 20 k profit border?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Seems to be a few haters on this thread, if you can`t succeed at trading do something else.

Oh by the way, my win rate is a lot higher than 70%, in fact I always come out on top, so it`s always a win win.

If I remember rightly from your previous posts, you're talking about binary.com, with which I also have an account due to the tiny minimum stake size. The danger of this broker with this system is that their quoted prices are in pips, rather than the usual pipettes like all other BO brokers.

Take EUR/USD for example, if you had a call at 1.26201 which expired at 1.26209, that would be a winner. But at binary.com the entry price would be 1.2620 and the expiry price 1.2620. I'm sure you know that a tie is a loser with binary.com, the expiry has to be strictly higher or strictly lower than the strike price. So in a system like this where every pipette counts, I wouldn't use them. And no, I don't think there's any broker offers up to 100% return.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi nervesof,

I also have an account with Binary.Com.

The advantages are there that they never call you, I hate that, because I want to trade on my own.

You can choose any amount you want to risk AND any expiry time you wish. The return if it's a winner is also higher than with others.

There is always of course some problem with any broker and here it is, like you say, that the expiry has to be strictly higher or strictly lower than the strike price ...and the pip system. For this last one, it's better to trade the pairs with JPY ...

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Please download the version_4 of the indicator

I hope that the big martingale experts check the figures, because there may still be errors in the program.

- overlapping signals are avoided

- you can enter a test period between day1 and day2

- you can get signals at the second or the third bar in the overbought / oversold zone

- Note: the idea with signals when cross the levels from the outside brings worse results

Thanks a lot for this wonderful tool. It becomes very easier to improve the strategy without checking manually !

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Is there anyone that can help explain the difference in results between Swingmans indic results (not very encouraging) and Sugarman live results ? would be a big hep to me , thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Me too. I totally believe Sugarman's getting the results he posts here but the backtesting results are terrible. Seeing as how the standard Stochastic settings are 80/20 and this strategy uses 95/5 which is waaaaaaay overbought/oversold, I simply can't conceive that the price only reverses 54% of the time as per the backtesting, it's just not logical. But I also believe that the people doing the backtesting are genuine.

There has to be some explanation. I understand that the backtesting doesn't concern Sugarman because he's already getting the results but when you're new to the strategy it's a bit scary.

Yep, Sugarmas method in untratable in the long therm. If rigorously following his rules I got two weeks ago a week on e/u with 45% w/l ratio and 6 loses in a row, different TF or dates didnt give me satisfactory results. Although Sugarman is saying he is not using any discretion to pick up the trades, he must to do so.

I don't quite understand why he is calling this unbeatable hard math hatred and shitty behavior, thats what trading systems forums are about.

If I take in account that he was negatin his own words about martingale, I got really strange feelings about all this

After many hours in front of screen I think better approach would be to wait for some non-lagy confirmation that the swing top/bottom is already over, testing right know some promising indicators for this approach, will let you know I will find out reliable solution. If we will take in count the trend direction or sideways market conditions, where the Sugarmans method could be applied, than we can get some long therm strategy with clear and repeatable rules.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
did you get those 6 consec losses trading normal  UK -US trading hours only ?

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Try a 200 ema as a filter.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
it was asian session: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...45#post7762745
I always backtest all sessions because years of trading teached me, that silimar conditions as in asian session can happen in eu-us trading hours too, from time to time, so its good to take in consideration the worst case scenarios too.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Sorry, novice trader here. Do you mean use the 200 ema to identify whether it's trending or ranging? And preferably avoid taking a trade in a strong trend? Could you confirm if this is what you mean or explain further, please.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Trend - long above, short below.

Sugarman , can you please explain how it comes that your worst week you only made 360, if you allways double , and at the end you win , should allways be around 2000?

maybe it was a quiet week resulting in very few signals. Why should it always be around 2000 where did that figure come from?

Please Bargain stay cool...

If you had read the entire Thread (and i suggest you to do that before asking something), you should know that sugarman simply used Stochastic indicator (14,3,3, Close/close).

But we have not the same resultant than his. I don't know how he master the trades but he is brilliant.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I`m not using any of those, I only have a standard stochastic set at 14.3.3.

buy EUR/USD

--- 帖子 #635 ---
He's not using any of the indicators from this thread. I asked the same question before.  As far as I understand it, Sugarman only looks at stochastics and make the trades when it hits below 5 or above 95.

as you can see from the pic above

1, the light indy shows 79% up trend and 21% downtrend, which shows the bullish behavior

2,if u look at the Mbfx timing it signals that the pair is also bullish

3, then ur stoch shows bullish also

if you take a Bearish trade, it wont end all in Bearish because u have a strong uptrend even when the stoch shows bearish, so u don't take bearish trade in a strong bullish trend. hope i made a point

If you want to trade the ABCD patterns you should check this out : http://www.harmonictrader.com/price_patternsabcd.htm

You can also trade a 123-pattern : check out the 4th picture I shared yesterday.

161.8 % seem to be a golden level. And if the the signal indicator on the bottom confirms it's a high probability to reverse. Not a 100% succesfull idea though.

Here is a example from this morning. A exact turn at 161.8 % with a ABCD pattern.

sugarman - if you're using IG then I guess for the 1 minute you are using "sprint". On the 5 minute do they offer you a chance to cash out early if trade is going in your favour - this is very popular now with sports betting particularly.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hi Handy

thanks for the info, I never knew you could cash out early on a 5 min, are you sure?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
I also use IG markets. For sprint markets it is not possible to exit earlier.

To exit earlier you have to choose another binary option type of trading. Which looks more like regular forex.

Kind regards,

Dennis

Sugarman this is what i think should be right way to trade that your system and i suggested to swingman to change the entry to be when the stoch is leaving the OB/OS region.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Nice Sugarman, that you use only one indicator, but I think it's too risky.

I trade from the M1 chart, I even use two of them.

The first has 26 indicators, the second 20. Most are 'Elite indicators' so I can't share them.

I also use a M5 chart, for confirmation AND a 1 hour chart for the long term trend.

Maybe I use too many indicators, but I mostly look at some of them, on the M1 chart it goes very fast. I have more time when I trade the M5, but there I trade for 15 minutes. I also only trade one or two pairs, there are huge possibilities in one pair, I don't have to look at a screen with 15 different pairs, you don't have time for that when you trade the M1.

But it's all in my mind, the more you train, the better you become ...

It's amazing what one's mind can do, I'm very good at an online game 'Tekken Dark Ressurection Online', there I 'fight' with Lei Wulong. He has more than 130 different moves, which you can control with a controller with 12 buttons. After some training it goes automatically, like riding a car ...

So, if your mind is used to many indicators, it's no problem at all.

I think if anyone other than me would use my system, he would get crazy. Maybe I am ...

Therefore, everyone should develop his own system and stick to it. When you try to copy someone elses, mostly it doesn't work ...

So if only one indicator works for you, why change ? On the other hand, I also would use a MACD and some other indies.

I have lost a lot of money when I started BO, like many people do, but I have been training for months (I still do) and I have only recently restarted trading.

Of course I made some 'mistakes' (those are not mistakes, if price doesn't 'follow' you), but nevertheless if 'feels' like a mistake.

But I'm getting rather good, my last 10 trades for 2 Euro each : 9 winners and 1 loss.

I'm still very prudent ...the last thing you want is getting too confident.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
It`s working really well, at the moment I`m +£309.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
So here is a chart with free indicators, all NRP (non-repainting).

It's not overcrowded ...

I don't think you have to wait for the stoch to get oversold. This one you can trade with the colors together with the Nonlag Ma NRP.

There is also a MACD for the 'trend'. On the chart a 'squeeze' indicator, you do not trade when that appears ...but right away when it's away.

On the chart there is a very good, non-lagging nonlag Ma NRP with a PCT filter. Also better not trade when this baby is flat (the filter does that).

There is also a 'MA Rounding' indicator, on the chart it is set to lenght 5 and rounding 10, but there are a lot of possibilities to play with.

So look for your self for the best settings.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Ok guys, 1 min trade ended at £389.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
nice results sugarman, is that on one currency pair or multiple?

--- 帖子 #810 ---
One currency pair, to trade any more would be a nightmare.

Good Morning

First 1 min trade buy EUR/USD was a winner.

I have found working off a 1 min chart with an expiry of 2 min is better.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
you are trading only e/u ?

you wait till candle closes to open trade?

--- 帖子 #823 ---
1 min trades are proving to be better than the 5 min, this is likely due to more signals.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
what is your winning rate on 1 min ?

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Yesterday was £389, so far today £209

--- 帖子 #826 ---
this is with doubling up, but how manny win vers/looser, how many cons losses?

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Up to now, wins 19 losses 14 with +£598.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Is that with 1 or 2 min expiry?

--- 帖子 #829 ---
1 min chart, 2 min expiry.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
how many max consec losses ?

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Only started yesterday, however only 2.

Maybe you should try out yourself, just remember 1 min chart stochastic over sold / bought then leaving that area with a 2 min expiry BO, simple`s.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
last 2 were losses , before 1 win, Did y get the same?

--- 帖子 #833 ---
last 2 were wins for me.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
this is a mistery to me ; maybe you don't wait till candle really passes the overbought/oversold? just going right direction and touching is enough?  candle at 14:19 was when area was left , took 14:20, you took 14;19 ?

--- 帖子 #835 ---
buy EUR/USD now.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
buy e/u

--- 帖子 #837 ---
winner, did you get this one?

--- 帖子 #838 ---
yes, you indeed get in early , this is a quick game , only 1 currency is possible!

--- 帖子 #839 ---
I get in on the close of the bar, so the next bar is my trigger bar.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
i guess you can get a 40-50 trades a day with it, need to see longer time stat, looks interesting

--- 帖子 #841 ---
the problem is that the indicator only shows it when the bar finishes , till tha last second you can't really see if it passed or not ,

--- 帖子 #842 ---
buy e/u

--- 帖子 #843 ---

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Last one was a winner for me

--- 帖子 #846 ---

--- 帖子 #847 ---

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Yep got in that one, winner..

--- 帖子 #849 ---
I assume the same rules apply for doubling up, only one trade per overbought or oversold unless it moves out of that area a decent amount first.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
sell , lost

--- 帖子 #851 ---
that sell lost

--- 帖子 #852 ---
why "decent amount" ?

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Just from my experience if you are trying to sell in a strong buying market odds are you will keep losing, if you look back to yesterday with this system there is a downward trend that kept giving false signals.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hi Steve

Yes but we are only taking a 2 min trade, I cant see a strong trend in a direction will effect this.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
sell

--- 帖子 #856 ---
True sugarman, only time will tell, I doubled up on this buy so lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
yes me too, winner

--- 帖子 #858 ---
winner.

sugarman , how many trades did y take today till now?

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Yes another winner and a good one at that.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Sorry Steve missed this post.

Correct doubling up, well for me anyway, however some guys probably could`nt stomach that.

Correct again only one trade per bought / sold.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
so far:

wins 13 losses 7

Total £486

--- 帖子 #862 ---
I`m getting more on this single pair than all 6 pairs at 5 min BO.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Am not sure I got this right : if you sold, and lost  and the bar had left the overbought and came back and you sell again, you do not double on a sell ? till the next buy?  don't think that's what you meant here?

--- 帖子 #864 ---
there is a lot of vooatility  today. maybe the most volatile pair has to be chosen every day.

any special reason you choose e/u ? backtest? or random?

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Ok,we are in over sold area, market moves out we buy for 2 min expiry, it looses. Now if the market moves back in that area I would wait until it moves out again and buy again with a double up trade.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Looked at the JPY and GBP pairs they are too lively for this method, EUR/USD and USD/CHF are pretty good.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
If you really want to go for it,you could (if it were over bought) sell EUR/USD and buy USD/CHF at the same time as they move in opposite directions. However you could be doubling your risk, just a thought.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
sell EUR/USD

You may (or may not) find this stochastic indi interesting.

Thanks, handy148, I'm always happy to try out interesting indicators.

By the way, I might be the only one who thanks you, most people don't do that anymore....everything is taken for granted.

Hi Sugarman,

may I know your broker spread for main pairs,

How do you deal with 1 min TF candle , can it cover your spread ?

TNX

--- 帖子 #891 ---
IN Binary options .............there is no spreadssssss

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Hi Folks,

I am very new here in the Forum and still a noob on trading, too.

I was very Interested in trading bo´s since 1,5years and traded on a Demoaccount.

Strangely enough this Account is at Bdb and is still active since then. I started with a decent amount 25000€ to play around, played it down to 400€ and now that i have a system i´m up to 9000 again

My trading is very similar to yours, and when i have a look at your trades, i took many of them too.

I understand, that trading without real money is a very different game, but i started trading real money last week and i am 266€ up

Here is what i do:

I am trading only Eur / usd

1 m charts

Bollinger Bands (MA 20, Deviation 2,3)

Rsi 14

If a candle is out of the bands and in the overbought/oversold area (rsi: 30/70) i take a trade with 120 secs expiry

The candle does not have to close, i will take trades on open candles.

To fight overtrading, i open only one option per candle.

Maybe someone is interested in this style of trading, i thought i can share

PS:

Sugarman: I tried doubling up, bit i sh*t my pants when there were over 800€ pending orders...luckily i won. But never again

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Ok guys, from Monday I will be trading ONLY USD/CHF on a 1 min chart with a 2 min expiry BO. After back testing this over the last 12 months this by far (for me) is the better pair and time scale.

I have been trading for the last 6 months on a 5 min expiry, however the 1 min gives more signals with better results.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
it depends of broker, i know dukascopy do with spread but the payout is always at 90%

--- 帖子 #895 ---
could you share what he results of your backtest are approx ? what is the win / loss rate , and how many max consecutive losses did you have? thanks

--- 帖子 #896 ---
I jumped to that conclusion already a long time ago.

Trend is given by higher timeframes, but the real action always starts and ends FIRST on the M1 !

So, for BO the M1 is the best ...

But trading only with the M1, without looking at the higher timeframes, will kill your account.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
latest indicator install is 1: boItilianJob matrix_v6

2: boSugarman_Signal_V4

this is rights?

use 1M with 2M expiry, rights?

can someone confirm this?

--- 帖子 #898 ---
No chance mate.

Ok so you are saying look at the overall trend and only take trades on a 1 min in that direction, trading on higher TF yes I agree but not on a 1 min, you will still loose and miss a lot of trades that you would have one.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
This week I did 12 trades on only one pair, it took me 3 hours time. It was on GBP-JPY. Yes, I missed some in that pair....

AND I have enough indies on my M1 chart  to know what the M1 does. The major problem on the M1 is a lot of noise, it helps if you look at the M5 once in a while.

So I won 10, lost 2. Always 3 minutes, once 4 minutes on the M1.

One I lost because I was not fast enough, jumped in too late and it was the only time I took a trade for 4 minutes.

The other one was a countertrade in a downmove, but I lost, very stupid. I thought there would be a reversal

If I had been looking at the M5, which is also on my screen, I wouldn't have taken the trade up, but down. ALL the indies there said down...

Always better to trade with the trend when you use the M1, the mini trend is given by the M5, the major one I get from H1.

Of course, I'm still in 'training mode', but the experience will come...

Everyone has his own trading style, I use a lot of indies, you only one.

You only take a trade when the stoch is OS or OB with 95-5 levels.

I take trades with the 50 level also and I do not rely only on the stoch. Actually I have four stochs in one chart, one fast nonlag one, one slow nonlag one, one nonlag M5 one on M1 together in one subchart and one super smoother to assist the CCI ...

I use MACD, moving averages, SSA, RSI, CCI, RSX, RMI, Bollinger Bands, Coppock ....all NRP, with the exeption of the SSA, that does not repaint, but recalculates. So when all these indies say the same thing, it's mostly bingo !

--- 帖子 #900 ---
It all depends on the strategy that you are using, 1 min is that quick that you can counter trade the trend.

At the end of the day time will tell.

1 min £78

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Nice one, are you playing it safe today?

--- 帖子 #944 ---
No same as before, there`s just not as many signals today.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
which broker allows such small accounts?

--- 帖子 #946 ---
What are your recomendations about TF and expiration?

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Hmm, that depends.

In fact, you can use these indicators in every timeframe. You only have to tweak them a little in accordance to the timeframe.

For example, on the M1 you want more smoothing, on H1 less for BO.

Just play with the settings, put the same indicators four times in the same chart in different subwindows and compare what is the best setting for the timeframe you are in.

I personally trade the M1, with the help of the M5 and the H1.

When I will have more experience, I will trade the M5 and later on also the M15.

Mostly it's the way around, but I always try the difficult things first...

Some trade the M5, others M15, other H1, it all depends what you like most.

I also have 4 time frame indicators on the M1 :   M1, M5, M15 and M30, so one can see what the higher timeframe does.

When a 4 time frame indicator is all green or red, it's a very strong signal.

Expiration ? I would trade the M1 for 3 minutes, the M5 for 15 minutes, the M15 for 45 minutes.

I all depends, when you trade against the trend (I sometimes do) of course less expiry, with the trend is safer, so longer expiry.

You still trading this.

Not such a good day yesterday, +£160, currently I`m down £169 for today.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
i opened with a broker that does not have 2 min, trading old system 5min, not very good yesterday either , also today.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
when it passes the oberbought/sold  only at the  close of candle, when next begins,  you trade right away or waiting next candle to close ?

--- 帖子 #1031 ---

nice! , did you have lately again 4 consecutive losses on 1min, or not anymore?

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Yes had 4 today.

Now +£152.

seems that 1 min trades have a lower win/loss rate but have more available signals, correct?

what is the min bet there ? (have to consider the need do double up...)

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
£20

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
20 means a loss of 300 by 4 and a loss of 460 with 5 losses..to much for me to begin with.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
I use iq options, 1min 2 min and three min on turbo options.

Minimum trade size is $1 and min deposit is $10 so good to practice live.

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
I did some backtests for the mentioned pairs (eurusd, usdchf, usdjpy, gbpjpy) in the 5min timeframe and got about 55% win ration.

Considering a payout of 80% is very hard to get profitable.

I dont consider using martingale, because in the test I got 6 losses in a row ...

How do you guys are managing to get profit? I'm trying with lots of "gambling strategies" like 1324, fibonacci, paroli ... to see if I get better results.

Hi Steve

Where is the turbo options at IG?

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Thanks for info , will try it also.

Steve and Sugarman , do you get some times 4 cons losses at 1 min or only very rarely?

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
3 losses on usd/chf 1 min today

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
I`m up to 5 losses continuing from yesterday.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
6th trade winner.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
you must had have a sixth loss and the recovered with number 7 !

this is a total of 1350 loss before recovery, is it worth it ?

was thinking of going only till 4 times and then beginning again , would like your opinion on this .

all depends probably how many times y get 4 losses , once a month would be ok , more becomes problematic..

missed your last post , anyway , possibility exists, would like your opinion

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
I had 5 losses so the 6th was a winner, not 7.

Yes it`s worth it otherwise I wouldnt be here, if you cant take the losses then I suggest you move on.

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
my question was about the best money management for this system : continuing to double limitless , or stopping at 4 and begin again , it all depends on the frequency from the 4 cons losses , in the 5 min you had it 1 in 8 month , in this system is this very frequent?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
It`s a personally thing, if you want to stop at 4 and start again, then maybe the 5th would have been a winner, we all have our own MM.

Frequency, nobody has a crystal ball to predict how may losses you will encounter.

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
you are right about the crystal ball , but for the past  few weeks that y are trading the 1 min , do you remember how many

4 (or more) cons. losses you had already?

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
usd/chf loss

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
I think only 3/ 4 cons. losses.

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
The turbo option is on IQ options, the broker that I use.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
Ok, sorry I missed red your post, I thought you said ig.

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
thanks. do you have a way to see in your trade history the ratio win/loss in your 1 min trades ?

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
it doesnt work like that, if I loose I double up so in the end I will come out as a winner.

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
yes , i know , but if you do not have a winning edge , you can double randomely, pure martingale and long term you loose: if you have , even 65/35, then this is a long term good strategy.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
as I`ve mentioned before, been doing this for 6 months and I`m still here, this system has no where near blown my account.

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
I'm writing an EA to test this for the entire 2014 year. I'll test with many gambling strategies (lets see if martingale will blow or not the account).

Sugarman, do you use 1% per trade? Or less?

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
don't forget to put the right trading hours .

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Wowwww, it's been Long I posted in this Thread, Working on a New strategy, for Now it has been 10 wins 3 Losses, will post wen I am done testing this strategy at the expense of my Live account. Hope you Guys are great. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Actually in my tests the results were basically the same either trading only London/NY or trading the whole day. Both nearly 55% win ratio.

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
did you test both methods , 5min and 1 min on only usd/chf ? they are completely different.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
5min on eurusd, usdchf, usdjpy and gbpjpy.

Which methods/combinations do you think are worth to test?

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
1 minute chart.   ONLY with USD/CHF stochastic leaving over bought / sold

expiry is 2 min.

same settings  for stoch

this is what is traded now here.

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Morning Guys

Really don`t have much time to post due to job.

However, this morning 3 winning trades.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Good Evening folks,

i have been following this thread...never traded BO before, but now thinking about it.

I am using iLMike's 1min chart with just the stochastics on it and plotting as per his instrtuctions.

This is surprisingly accurate for the 5 minute trade.

Is this what you are using, Sugarman?

Regards

Ross

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Hi Ross

The one minute is good, however there are more signals which can result in a loosen streak compared to the 5 minute. It all depends on your MM, I will probably revert back to the 5 minute, purely due to my job and screen time.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
Thanks Sugarman

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Hi, are you using the Imike indicator posted on the first post of this thread?

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
Nope, never have done, please read through my posts.

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Hi.

So, I didnt like the results of my EA (probably because lack of data for M1 tf in the strategy tester). Then I just created an indicator to points the entries (similar to swingman's matrix). I backtested using this indicator and the results were poor

For usdchf 1min/2min trade when leaving oversold/bought I got something like 52% win ratio and 9 losses in a row (September, trading London/NY session; avoiding Red news 1 hour before and 1 hour after; and avoiding holidays/NFP all day)

I tested tweaking the settings 1min TF with 1min expiry ... 1min TF 5min expiry ... trading when entering the oversold zone. Tested with other pairs too (eurusd, gbpjpy ...). Everything was the same. Somedays getting 60%, 65% ... even 70% win ratio ... in other days getting 40%, 35% ... even 20% win ratio. The final average is 52%.

This is for a few more than 100 trades. I guess in the long run the result will get close to 50%. That means its just random.

This is what I got. If you're having better results then you should be trading in a different way.

Hi Feanor

Not sure if you got your back testing right. Nothings changed, trading the same way as I have mentioned for the last 6 months.

I don`t have time to post anymore, however results on the 5 min BO are going great, seem to be making around the £400 / £500 mark weekly. I have ditched the 1 min purely based on screen time and work load.

Hope everyone else is doing well, mind you due to the lack of posts I imagine most guys have given this up.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
tried the 1M1 /2 min, too many losses in a row, going back to 5 min also . you still have same results? only 1 time 4 cons loss in lat 6 month?

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
How is it going guys?

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
EA to trade on CoreLiquidity

- Some member asked for an EA.

I have previously developed one, unfortunately now I can not say whether it works properly or not...
Please do not ask about, tests and changes the code itself if something is wrong.

- The indicator is very useful because it draws the equity, or you do not know how you've traded on CL.

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
Other indicators required by usern.

I think that with the EA you can trade the original method and Sugarman's martingale.

See the parameter settings.

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
Going great, still trading off 5 min.

How about yourself.

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
Good for you

I had to move back to regular forex trading. BO didnt work for me

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Hi all,

A newbie here, have only been trading BO for a couple of months.

What I have found working well for me, is taking 5min trades based on the closing of 1min candles, in relation to where they close outside the Bollinger Bands. The requirement to learn more, and excel with this strategy, led me to do a bit of research, and voila, I ended up here, with like minded folks.

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
Swingman,

Is it possible to ADD your Moving Average found here, as a filter as well to the Italian Job Matrix V6 or V4. This way I am filtering signals by the Trend.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
Hello fvtrader, could you show what you mean with an image for me to better understand it? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
Anyone know the fix Martingale sugarman boItalianJob EA? he is not working

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
Trade manually, EA`s don`t always work properly.

Anybody else still trading this?

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
EA ta running cool Sugarman, only the martingale is not doubling the value, if anyone knows solve it is 100%

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
thanks sharing ..

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
If you lose, do you double up or look for another trade.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Hey! I will start to try this strategy from next monday. What currency do you recommend? I guess that USD/CHF is giving good results now, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
hi, i tested this strategy and i have to say that its higly profitable and very easy..

but i spending too much time for just siting and watching all graphs, so my question is:

do you have any idea how to setup an alarm on matrix indicator?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Sugarman, which kind of price do you use on your Stoch 14.3.3?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
close/close

MA, simple

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
So guys, finally I'm here!!! In the near past I have had serious problems which did not allow me to do anything until now. I ask sorry to you all. Anyway, I've see a lot of people with a lot of intrested in the ItalianJob and Sugarman System! I'm really happy. I've updated the First post just now to do some cleaning.

I want to tell all of you that I'm already working on something crazy! A real 2.0 ItalianJob system, so, I hope to receive support from you all.

I'll give you update soon here.

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Sounds good ilMike, looking forward to seeing what crazy thing you have come up with.

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
By the way, the nonlag stoch nrp mtf was my little contribution ...

Glad to see you back, ilMike !

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Guys, the best results are obtained on a 5 minutes TF with a 10 minutes expiry. Max successive loss registered from the system with this setup is 4 in all assets (5minTF-10minEXP), so you can think to apply a Martigale MM. Here is the last version Attachment .

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
Hi Mike

Your attachment is not opening.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
opens fine here, will be testing this mike. cheers man

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
it works for me although the results don't look that good on the one chart I looked at, although they did look better with a 200 ema on the chart and only take the signals long above and short below the ema. However, this was just a quick visual check and by no means a proper back test.

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
The attachment is the last v6 Italianjob matrix.

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Got it, thanks Mike.

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Set the chart with a 5min TF and be sure that the matrix is set as default with a 10 minutes exp. Let me know.

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
mike the overall win % doesnt seem that different from v6 does adding martingale help push that up?

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Definitely. My goal is to create a system that gives me less consecutive losses possible. In this way you can think to applying a mm based on Martingale. But read here, I personally use a martingale that bring me to balance the investment lost and so not to double it. For example, if my broker offers a payout of 81% and the first investment of 25 is lost, I don't do a new investment of 50(so double), but I apply this mathematical formula "investment lost divided by the % payout" then 25:0.81=30.86. If it is lost again I do 1st investment plus 2nd investment divided by the % payout so (25+30.86):0.81=68.96... and go on.

But I do not always doubled at the first opportunity. Sometimes I give up, it depends on the market.

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
excellent thanks for that info. Im also looking forward to 2.0 you are a star for sharing with us all thank you for that!

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
Ok guys, I need a good mt4 programmer, please pm me.

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Why don't you ask Mladen or Mrtools from TSD ?

Those are always very helpful when you want to modify an indicator, at least when it's not an 'Elite' thing.

There is also a thread on this site, called : 'I will code your EAs and indicators for no charge'.

There you can ask some things too.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Hello!

I can program it.. give me more details about your idea.

i've saw the initial pages of this thread, the entrys only depends of the indicators levels, so it should be easy to code.

Also, we can block the trading during news, using a webrequest for a news provider.

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
Thank you, I'll do asap

PM for you

-DI close over level 50 (True false and level editable)

Candle close bear (True false)

Candle close over the BB (True false)

Rainbow stoch(or multiple stoch) close all over level 10 (True false)
PUT RULES
-DI close between 0.9999 level and 0 (True false and level editable)
+DI close over level 50 (True false and level editable)

Candle close bull (True false)

Ok, I think I've already improved the original strategy I had in mind. So i just need to wait mathinas so i can say for sure that we have something incredible in our hands! Super happy! Thank you guyyysss!

Hi ilmike, will it be an indicator or an ea? Its looking pretty good so far either way buddy. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
Both

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Great, thank you for sharing buddy, cant wait to give it a go.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
It's an EA, you need to install on Experts directory.

It also works as indicator, just fill StartDate and FinishDate on stats settings with the period that you want to analyze.

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
So, we are near to the end, and I'm really excited because we are creating something incredible! but there's something to correct. Please Matinhas, check better the adx rules.(look the img to understand what I mean)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Than, is possible to set a true false for each level and give the possibility to change the range level? It's really important this. I give you an example:

CALL RULES
+DI close between 0.9999 level and 0 (For this rule I just need to enable or disable it, like true false, level is ok, but i really need to enable or disable this single rule because maybe I would work only with -DI)
-DI close over level 50 ( I would like to change this rule and it would be super if I can set a range, like -DI close between level 50 and 45 and those single levels must be editable, maybe from 50 to 45 in 50 to 100)

Please, understand that CALL RULES are OPPOSITE to the PUT RULES so -DI and +DI will act in the opposite way for the PUT RULES

PUT RULES
-DI close between 0.9999 level and 0 (true false for this single rule)
+DI close between level 45 and 50 (each level editable for this single rule)

Thanks again to matinhas for him work, I really appreciate! I just inform you all that we are reaching impressive win %. I will tell you soon the right setup

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
hi!

ADX levels are now in ranges:

range 1: from 0 to 0.9999

range 2: from 45 to 50
Attached Image

many times you tell "over 50", for this setup, should select range 2 min:50 max:100

See below the conditions for the ADX, i guess it is in accordance with post 1124.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
ok, perfect, just last things and we are done!

-I've seen that during the asian session we have lot of bad signal, but during the european session most of the signal are good. Can we avoid the sidney and tokyo session? Best signals are generated during the only european session.

-check stock in the setup window, I can set only the lower level(10) but I didn's see the upper level(90)

-during my test i've see that many bad signal are generated because the level of the single adx is to much high. Can you please add the level for the adx too?

example

CALL RULES

+DI close between XX level and XX (as it is)

-DI close between level XX and XX (as it is)
ADX close under level XX

PUT RULES

-DI close between XX level and XX (as it is)

+DI close between level XX and XX (as it is)
ADX close under level XX

After this minor changes, I will wait until next week to test in live the best strategy. Believe me, the holy grail is close.

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
ilMike,

Great system my friend , I am a little bit confused though, have you scrapped the original entry rules (i.e. BB bands, stochs, etc.) and now only using the ADX levels to define call/put entries? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
Yes, i can add a scheduling. (trade from hh:mm to hh:mm). You wish one or two intervales?

Its symmetric: upper level = 100- lower level. If lower is 10, upper will be 90. If the lower is 15, upper will be 85.

You want two inputs ?

Sure, tonight i'll post the EA with all changes.

I'm happy just with stable return.. But lets see...

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
One for me is good but, never know, maybe two is useful for someone else

Ok, good to know, it's perfect as it is

Thank you, it's normal that you are confused, because I dind't give you all the final setup yet. For now i'm testing a lot of different combination, and for now only me know what I'm doing. All the rules that you have seen before are necessary for matinhas so he can understand what he need to code the right program.

With this final "product" I'm able to do new studies and create the perfect setup for a totally automated EA. But it will perfectly work for "manual" use too.

So please, for now, don't use the EA following the rules that I've posted before because they are only an example for matinhas. This is not the final product yet and ther's not a specific setup to follow yet. Don't use it for your daily trade. Please, wait some days so I can give you all the right setup to follow .

Thank you guys for your support, hope to give you good news soon!

looking forward to hear from u sooner,!

My Regards,,,,!

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
The system can have a good W/L ratio .. but the strategy is complex to understand the expected effect with each parameter change. Also have too many inputs and ranges that make unenviable a brute force optimization. So.. it needs a human touch and a lot of trial-error learning.

Other way would be to use machine learning and neural networks algorithms to find non-linear relationships between I/O... I'm thinking seriously about this way.

In the meantime, I thank everyone for their patience and all those who are working with me. Hope to give you good news soon.

Have a great day!

Mike

Hi all

I'm newbie of this thread but I'm in this thread

and 2 Question.

1) 1st type of jOB is still good?

I wanna try 1st type, so someone tell me Impressions.

2)Is it work on 5M chart?

1M binary is difficult for me(very fast)

That's why I wanna try 5M chart. and does it work?

Thank you in before

Hello Mike and all,

Please can can you tell me, has anybody done a seriously large back test on this system? I mean like 5 or ten years of 1 minute chart data?

I just did a quick test using an Excel spreadsheet with the calcs for Bollinger, rsi, and stochastic loaded as per the system, and ran it against the whole of 2015 1 minute chart from 8:00 to 21:00 GMT every trading day, I am sorry to report that it has a win rate of less than 53% which is actually lower than just using Bollinger on its own.... Maybe I am missing something?

Hi yuki, Italian job still work on 5 min TF also. In the end of the week I will do a little cleaning in the first post with different setups so stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
Hi

Thanks

I'll wait!

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Hi MA, thanks for you participation, at the end of the week I'll send to you also some different setup with more detailed specs, so you can do a new check. Anyway I am receiving lot of PM of thanks, but in any case we need to do more for best results. I'm working for it. Any suggestion is well received.

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
Hi Mike,

I think the problem is unless a lot of data is thrown at a method it is really hard to assess the win/loss rate, manually counting the chart just won't cut it as we all suffer from "confirmation bias" and miss losing trades subconsciously, also counting with the computer allows a much bigger sample to be counted. My spreadsheet was loaded with 300,000+ candles!

Of course it is possible to get lucky for a while and make money, but really unless there is a big enough edge to over come the "house" the end result will be losses.

I've been working on stats for binaries for a couple of weeks now, and I can assure you there are lot of counter intuitive results. I looked at your set up and I thought, yeah that looks hopeful, sadly the numbers over a large sample rarely lie.

Sorry if my info is a disappointment.. and who knows maybe I made a mistake.. Be lucky!

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
.

I totally agree with you. In fact one of the first thing that I write in my first post was that this system (the original one) give a win ratio that goes from 50% to 75%. But the win ratio is not my first prerogative now.

This thread was born not with the purpose to say "Hey all, I've find the holy grail!", but to say "Hey guys, I think I'm working on something intresting, would you help me?" and luckly I've met a lot of incredible people that give me lot! We all know how much the b.o. may be bastards and how much stupid we are using a wrong MM, like a martingala.

My first prerogative with the Italian jOB is to work on something that give us a maximum number of consecutive losses and to create an EA based on it. It is and it will impossible to find or create an "indicator" that can give us always 80 or 90 or 100% of win ratio, but we can create something that can help us to take the right decision in a bad moment.

For me a "good" indicator is that one that give me a maximum of X(4) consecutive losses, not that one that give me 80% of win ratio... that is relative.

Anyway, my trading style is based on PA for the 85%, I use indi when I need a confirmation.

I hope to give you all a better contribute in the next few days.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
Thank you for being so willing to share.

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
I can't see how you can say with any confidence what the max number of losses in a row will be. My point was that the indicators combined here perform less well than Bollinger on its own.... so as such I am not sure what the point of the combination is. Maybe I am missing the point.

You say your trading style is based on PA,  You use indicators when you need confirmation... Confirmation of what? Your gut feeling?

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
The only thing certain in life is that we are going to die. For the rest you're not saying anything new.

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
I don't think i'm gona die  .  I think I' m gona be changed in the twinkling of an eye.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
No I guess it is not new.  What is certain, is that playing Binaries the way you suggest is like playing roulette, except worse, because the house edge is greater.

I am trying to be constructive, scientific, I don't like living in a dream world.  I have found a 65% ish win rate method that works on 1 minute data in every year for the last 7, the thing is it only generates on average 10 signals per week assuming 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM  every day, trading it manually would be almost impossible, I've written an Excel VBA program that executes the trades and perhaps I'll come back here in a few months and tell you the results.

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
don't know what to say Moral, I can only repeat what I've already said, I'm here trying to work on something that every one can modify with the final intention to create an EA that can help us. We start from a point, but we don't know where we're going. We have already see that the performance are good but not enough for an EA. An so? We have tried, and I'm personally work on a new thing. I'm the first one that doesn't use the Italian jOB for a manually trade, I get crazy waiting all day in front of PC for just some "signal".

I appreciate a lot what you say and your contribution and believe me, I hope you can help me again when I'm ready because I've your same prerogative, have something "scientific". But by myself I can't do a lot, I need someone like you and only here I can find people ready to cooperate.

so I hope that you will join and enjoy with me doing more scientific test.

but tell me a thing, is good my English?  give me a smile

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
Your English is certainly a a lot better than my Italian  You speak any Russian?

I appreciate what you are trying to do.  If the end game is an EA written for MT4 I fear other reasons for failure also, I have a lot of experience in writing EAs both in MQL4 and using Excel VBA, one of the problems is that the brokers do not play fair and they switch off their APIs during volatile moments, also even if the API is active getting execution at the point where a lot of other money will also want it can be very difficult. I wish you luck.. and if I can get a system to work and execute going forward I'll come back here and tell about it

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
At the risk of ridicule, and controversity, may I introduce a sightly different perspective to the business of making money from BO.

BO is gambling. Your only counterparty is the "house" (broker) and the house margin is high.. on simple contracts .. most often 4/5.

Think about it.. in a Casino how many zeros on that wheel?

So you cant win?

Of course you CAN. Its apples and pears.

Yet all the algo/scientific bods will prove with irrefutable statistical data that the broker odds make it impossible.

BS.

Unlike fixed-odds betting.. poker/roulette/dice etc.. market based betting as in BO can be very profitable for a person with real expertise in interpreting the the movements of the underlying asset. With that understanding, and applying tech realtime probability analysis, and a sensible risk management system its entirely possible to engage selectively in very carefully chosen "bets" on the short-term movement of the underlying asset.

Same as a guy with enough expertise, and an extensive background and wide contact base in the Horseracing business can beat the bookies. Happens all the time.

If you dont believe what Im saying here..and you are an experienced PA trader with 5000+ hours STF screentime, try this test. Look at a 1min chart.. EURUSD.. (checking that there is no news imminent) And look at the patterns. Check up the TF ladder so you understand the 1/5/15/30 and above S&R.

If using a simple oscillator, Stoc/RSI/CCI or a Boll.. for guidance, or whatever.. in the next 60 bars (Minutes), ill be amazed if you cant accurately forecast with 60/70% accuracy, at least 5 successive bar closes from. Certainly in terms of being capable of predicting it being above or below the close of the key bar.

If you cant.. then with utmost respect, you need to reassess your skill level, and even career choice.

Its that easy.

Beating the House in BO is NOT impossible. In fact for the experienced trader its a given.

The only issue is not to be too visible or wind up your wins, to hurt the brokers business model.

And that way you become an acceptable part of the system.

And its only possible and made easier because most BO traders have little or no expertise in the underlying.

And they are what make the Broker his money in BO, the money he pays out to you.

iMike has created here a method to signal possible Hi-Prob opportunities on 5m contracts.

From what I see of it, its a good base even for an experienced trader to base an opportunity alert system on.

BUT its a BASE. After that its experience.

My success in BO is more about the signaled contracts I DONT take than with those I do.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
Thanks for a great post Cliff,  do you know if brokers like IG hedge their binary positions?

MA

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Moral Hi..

Great question.. IMHO.

No I dont.

But, I would expect that they do have a risk limitation method to "lay-off" or "hedge" risk where significant Book imbalances in longer TF contracts emerge. It would seem to be a risk management requirement in any stable business model. The shorter TF imbalances present a more difficult problem. Particularly in terms of the speed with which an excessive Book imbalance risk may emerge, and the design of a dynamic cost-effective method of hedge. However I stand in awe at the small insights Ive been given over the years into the genius of the Quant and HF algo designers and financial engineers...

So Im guessing probably yes.

But I expect it is only be exercised where specific Book imbalance risk levels are breached, since on the surface at least it would appear that any such method would be expensive to implement.

Perhaps another member with "inside" knowledge of the available BO business models, may be able to comment with more authority.?

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
I think (hope) so too.. The alternative would be to eject winning accounts, and I do not get the sense that IG is in that business.

BO system repaints?

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
Yes..this system can be good..but.....She is repainting! Be careful....

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
hi

does this still work for BO?

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Hi Michael,

I'm following this thread with great interest and it's been a while, since you posted something about the "italian job".

Your last entry concerning the indicators was on May 19th, 2015, your last post on this thread was on Nov 12th, 2015.

What does that mean ?

Are the indis from May 2015 the final result of your studies, or are you sitting in your "lab" and work on an improvement of "italian job" or another amazing strategy to surprise this community here with a big bang some day ?

If the latter is right, I'd be very happy

No, I've not even tested the "older" versions of italian job, so my basic question is, whether the indis from May 2015 are the ones, which I should download for testing.

Thanks in advance. I'm looking forward to reading new messages from you !

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
Hi SwingMan

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
Hi Mike and everyone else.

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
Hi mahk90

are you try another pairs ...

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
hi levon, i tried it on a few different pairs.

the screen is full of blue and red arrows which are all over the place with no yellow arrows at all...????

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
Hello Everybody,

This question was asked very often in the past.

A lot of comments in different forums redirect to this Italien Job EA.

But unfortunately the Binary Option OrderSend does still not work for me.

I also have opened the mq4 of the Italian Job EA to learn from the Order Send routine.

My Problem is, that i always get "Trade is Disabled" from my CLMFOREX Broker with the binaryOption Plugin.

(see Attachement Screenshot)

I am using the following for PUT:

int ticket=OrderSend(_Symbol,OP_SELL,Investment,MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_ASK),0,0,0,expirycmd,Identifier,0,clrRed);

Where expiryCMD is "BO exp:60"

Does anybody know what I am doing wrong?

Its a demo account at CLMFOREX, but I think this does not change the order String..

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
What Binary broker are you guys using for MT4?

--- 帖子 #1186 ---
This comment does not work with CLM. They do not declare what else will work. It works with NoaFX without problems on demo or live.

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
Hi,

I find the system really good, but i don't try yet. I would like to know if there are traders that follow the system , and their results.

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
Hello great traders...I load the EA on my mt4 broker platform NoaFX demo but it doesnt seem to work..Hello Mike.Is your EA still working?I would love to forward test and post results here.Please keep us posted.

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
hello to you all of the forum,

my name is Sergio,

I've seen this strategy.

can you tell me what are the indicators to be included in the final Mt4?

I ask "ilMilke" if I can contact to explain the strategy in Italian. (I saw on your profile that you live in Milan)

Thanks to all of you and thank you in advance ..

Sergio .......
