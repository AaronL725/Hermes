Hi Bilal Hope your doing well. I trade PA most of the time. Due to some private message I share this system in public forum. Since this system performed much better than most of the popular system here in FF I thought it will help. At list new traders will have a structure method to execute their trade.

Here are some live trade I took today. Every trade has very small stop and Good RR. What I share here is powerful. Don't go concept to concept. Learn the basic and leave those things. Trade a system, that will create your path easier. There are many course seller out there they will create new name new things just to take your money. Follow a simple system. Profit will come. Post your trade here, Ask question, discuses with each other that will make you more skill full in this system.

No Trade zone 2 trade open both trade close with profit. Both of trade is not A++ trade setup, I enter late. but got my return too. As a human you can't make 100% accurate trade all the time. Its ok. Remember I don't trade reversal so I don't use most of Course seller concept.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Here is a losing trade, I target big but I stop out. All the indicator support the entry but. EMA direction was not there I should have wait for that direction to come for trade. our losing trade is our best teacher if we want to learn form it.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
No trading zone break out, we got ema direction too but we don't get any entry. before getting entry price move lower fast. price enter into no trading zone again. we will wait for our trade.

--- 帖子 #27 ---

our safe trade is when price close to 10 and 20 ema. Why? Because we get good risk reward. Look one bad entry and one good entry. Big candle comes with the direction of the ema still I lose the trade. I should have enter in the black box. since price was choppy in the red box that is why I don't enter the trade. We have to manage our risk. No indicator based system manage our risk we have to do it ourself. As a day trader we have to limit our number of trade for the day it will safe us from Big DD.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi hasib, thanks for sharing your sistem. It is posible to have the Inndicators with MQL4 as we can make an EA for this strategy. Thanks and my best wishes!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi PetroPol Ok I will update MQL4 version if I have them. But I am not sure how it will work since This system involve discretion. I identify Choppy market with box and after that when box break out, I open trade with the direction of the EMA, by observing different timeframe, and Market hours etc some time I don't open trade when I see large candle. Again definition of large candle is self discretion. After a extending move when price start ranging I usually don't open trade. EA need exit rules, I use 2.5 RR as my profit target. My stop loss remain fixed. when I see market conditions is changing I manually exit them. Those exit are working for me but to build EA we need rules based exit rules. You can try ATR based exit. I am sure ea can't do what I do. Anyway, you can try. who knows if something good comes out.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I see your point, and next week i'll start to apply your system. And I'll work in order to find how to define the exactly conditions to enter a trade and how to manage the profits and the SL . I've some indicators that shows the current trend, so if i think some of my indi's could be useful i'll let you know about it, of course. As you said, it's possible that an EA won't be useful for this strategy, but at least we can try!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I look for current indicator MQL 4 version. Unfortunately, I don't have them. but I found this two version. Gann Average high Low activator will be the same as our current one if we select 10, 5, LWMA. You can try this CCI Super trend In your EA development. I add one more indicator, Step MA, Previously I created a EA with this indicator. By reducing the value you can use that as a exit indicator. By increasing the value you can use that as trend filter too. Hope it will help.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
weekend is coming, I thought price will not move up. I close the trade with little more than 1R. Now seems like price moved up. Anyway I am happy over all nice profit day end. Day started with gold trade loss.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
This is Daily, weekly and monthly ADR. You can use this indicator in your manual trading. I use different settings than Default one. I use 14 Range period. Hope it will help you understand market condition better.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Let me share my top down thought process, After that I am sure you will understand my thought process and apply this system in your trading. US30. Weekly chart. 1. All ema in the same directions which is up in this chart. 2. price close above 5 ema. 3. Candle behavior. We can see small candle last 3 week. Infect price is moving with the range of 1 weekly candle. conclusions , price is moving slow. Strong break out could happen in upcoming weeks. 4. Gann and super trend is up too. 5. This week close positive. small positive but it close with positive. so we can expect this week high or low or both will break out next week.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Us30 daily chart. Price did not touch weekly adr. We are observing price is moving slow. Other things same as weekly chart. super trend is bearish, Because of strong down side move previously super trend indicator turn bearish. Candle price with in the range of 1 big candle. Previous 2 day high has broken in the las day of the week. conclusions , Market is slow but moving towards upside.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
H4 Chart. 1. we are in a box. seems like box will break out towards upside. could move lower and move with in the box. 2. ema direction is up. 3. Gann turn positive.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Gentle Hasib, Thank you for sharing your interesting strategy. I also am a fan of US30. May you so kind to share with us the indicator with candles and the other with arrows? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi since I don't have any monitor in this system I use, Ichimoku Trend monitor for quick understand of current market condition. You can use it. Anyway, If any one interested they can create monitor for this system like Ichamoku monitor. 1. All time frame EMA directions 5, 10, 20, 34. if all ema up monitor should point up. if not monitor should show other signal. if down show down. 2. Gann High low average LWMA direction. 3. Heiken ashi indicator If the monitor is like Ichamoku monitor it will be better. They can keep Ichamoku monitor as well no problem with that. If any coder do that it will be great. candle indicator you will find in FF. I will share the link. If anyone need Ichamoku monitor source code let me know I will share it here.

Final trade of the day.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
market is slow all of a sudden price spike and come back to normal. Trading this kind of chart and market conditions requires skills. Need proper risk management so that losing a few trade will not harm much.

It took 7 hours to break this level and break out did not even hold price come back to range again.

There is no doubt that we are in slow market conditions. In slow market condition if you think you will enter a trade and you will get home run you will lose more. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In us market open I am expecting something like this. Again I am ready to any side move. But I am currently expecting upside more in upcoming session.

There's too much to read, but I really like the effort though! Really appreciate it. Once I have a little bit of free time, I'm gonna read this and try this out. Here's to hoping it'll perform well! Cheers!

Completed another day with this system. Market is moving both direction so i just remove EMA and focuses on price. Had few losing trade too. End the day with positive.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Bet best thing you can do here is wait.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Intuitions and luck, Hit 2 and but Hit TP.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Gold trade, First trade price quickly reverse and hit SL. Second trade close early Because I don't want to lose what I gain. Third trade I open I say price will most likely mover lower so lets take risk, close before tp hit.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE In their venerable bible of technical analysis, Edwards and Magee (1948; 4th ed., 1964) define support as “the price level at which a sufficient amount of demand is forthcoming to stop, and possibly turn higher for a time, a downtrend”; they give the inverse definition for resistance. The idea is that, as price declines, lower prices will naturally find more willing buyers. At some point, price declines far enough that buyers are willing to soak up all the sell orders in the market, and the market will stop going down. This theoretical concept is sound, but there is another important point to consider: real markets have so many competing influences and so much noise that prices frequently stop at random levels. That, coupled with our innate tendency to find patterns in random data, can cause support and resistance areas to appear on charts for no significant reason. Potential Support/Resistance To start, consider an important refinement to the concept of support and resistance. This may seem like a subtle and insignificant point, but it is important. Anytime you think, speak, or write about a support area, attach the word potential to that definition. Prices are not coming down to a support area; they are coming down to a potential support area. Too many times, traders think that these areas are magic lines on the chart, and that price will bounce there. This may be as much a function of language as anything else, but this change in thinking will remind you that the best we can say about a support area is that it is an area where price may have a higher probability of pausing. It is easy to point to these areas in the middle of charts and to say how well they worked, but dealing with decision making under the uncertainty of the hard right edge is quite a different matter. Be flexible and open to the message of developing price action; always attach the qualifier potential when considering any support or resistance level. In addition, support and resistance should properly be thought of as zones or areas rather than exact lines. If you were drawing them on paper charts, just like trend lines, a crayon might be the appropriate tool, not a drafting pen. It is unrealistic to expect prices to come to a potential resistance level and to stop precisely at the level. It is far more likely to see prices stop at some point in front of the level, or for the level to be violated. If the level is significant and closely watched by many market participants, it is not uncommon to see large spikes through the level, followed quickly by renewed selling at the resistance level. Consider this action in the context of the classic Wyckoff springs and upthrusts ; traders need to consider this point in their process of risk and trade management. Broken Support Becomes Resistance One of the classic rules of support and resistance is that support, once violated, becomes resistance. Conversely, resistance, once violated, becomes support. (You already should be thinking, “Wait a minute—support, once violated, becomes potential resistance.”) The reason given for this is that traders made a stand at a previous resistance level by attempting to sell enough to hold down prices. They failed when price traded through that resistance, and those traders incurred losses on their short positions that were entered at the level. If price returns to the same level after trading higher, they will be at breakeven on their shorts and will cover them (buy them back) in an attempt to reduce further losses, or so the theory goes. Their previous selling efforts at a level now turn into buying pressure at the same level, which may be able to at least temporarily halt a rally.

Joe Ross post here in FF. I hope his suggestion will help you. A reader asks: How do you handle fear? I seem to have plenty of it. Let's get one thing straight. Fear, for the majority of traders, is a very real thing. You have it, I have it. Others have it as well. What is it that traders fear? The top three, in order, are: 1.Fear of missing a trade. 2.Fear of losing money. 3.Fear of being wrong and losing face. In order to become a professional trader, you must learn to deal with fear. The first step is to acknowledge that you have it, which is what you have done. Once you admit to fear, you can begin to deal with it. When you notice the impulse to trade based on strong fear, it is usually best to literally step out of the trap by stepping out of the situation. You need to get up, walk away from the computer. Turn off the television if it's tuned to a financial station, take a walk, get something to eat, go outside and cut the grass, water the lawn, or do anything that will move you out of the fear/panic mode. Don't return to your trading desk until you have managed to achieve some emotional control over your fear/panic reaction. If you can't get a grip on your fear, then don't come back that day. Most likely you will find that even if you keep thinking about the miserable market conditions while you water the lawn, simply getting away from the keyboard and monitor is enough to make a difference. It removes the demand to take action, and gives you the mental space to gain perspective and let go of your impulsive, fear-based reaction.

4 Stages of Loss in Forex Trading (babypips.com) Though losing trades is a normal part of the trading process, it is something that many traders –both newbies and pros– have difficulties with. I believe that the main reason behind the difficulty in coping with losses lies with the lack of understanding of its nature and its impact on trading psychology rather than actual psychological problems. Today, I’d like to talk about the 4 stages of loss in forex, namely, denial, rationalizing, depression, and acceptance. Do the terms sound familiar? They should because they’re similar to the 4 stages of grief! Do note, however, that they are applied differently in forex. Stage 1: Denial The first stage of loss enables you to deal with the losing trade. In this phase, you deny to yourself and to others that your trading idea was wrong and that the loss wasn’t your fault. Reasons like “I was stop hunted” and “I didn’t really care for that trade” are normally used. There’s nothing wrong with feeling this way, especially if you’re new. It’s a way to ease the blow to your ego, survive the loss, and move on. Stage 2: Rationalization After denial, you move on to rationalizing your trade setup. This is the point where you point out everything that’s right about your trade idea and do not even think about what you did wrong. You cite the appropriateness of your trading plan, profit target, stop loss, and entry point but totally disregard that you actually did lose the trade and made a mistake somewhere. Stage 3: Depression At this point, you’ve already looked at all the possible external reasons for your loss. You then turn inward and consider the idea that the loss was completely caused by your own doing. Although it’s reasonable to take responsibility for your loss, blaming yourself too much can be damaging to your forex career if you consistently doubt yourself. You might ask yourself questions like “Is forex trading really for me?” and “Why go on at all?” You could even wind up withdrawing yourself from the business altogether if you can’t find enough reasons to keep pushing forward. Those who have experienced this kind of self-doubt can attest that the longer the losing streak is, the more intense the feeling of depression. Some even talk about pursuing other opportunities and giving up on forex trading altogether! Stage 4: Acceptance In this stage, you begin to realize that it’s unhealthy to blame yourself for everything that went wrong. Even though you’ve accepted that the loss was partly your fault, you are also mindful of the fact that the forex market is a wild untamed beast and that there are plenty of market factors beyond your control. Let me clarify though that acceptance isn’t simply about feeling okay about the loss. In truth, acceptance is more like aligning yourself with reality and realizing that the loss cannot be undone. When you reach this stage, you accept that you have made some mistakes on your part but that there are also things you are unable to control. At the end of the day, it’s important to remind yourself that you can never truly reverse what has been lost but that you can make up for it. One obvious way to do this is to have a winning trade and recover financially, but you can work on rebounding mentally as well. You can come up with improvements for your trading strategy, exercise better risk management, or just figure out how to handle your losses better. Instead of simply denying the loss, you have to move on, adapt, and grow.

Is more information always better? Some traders, when they are considering a trade, will use multiple indicators and analytical tools, solicit opinions from other traders, and even consider elements such as fundamentals that do not really have a bearing on their time frame. This approach can lead to “paralysis by analysis” as so many factors are considered, with so many conflicting points of view, that the trader simply does not know what to do. The justification offered for this approach is that an officer on a battlefield would want every possible piece of information, wouldn’t he? Perhaps not. It might be better for the decision maker to have processed intelligence from verified and trusted sources that has already been filtered from the massive flow of raw information. In trading, the equivalent is to focus on a few simple tools that are completely understood—depth of information, rather than breadth. It is critical that traders understand the subtleties of every tool they use. They should know how they react in every possible market environment, and furthermore, must understand the complex interactions between multiple tools. This may lead to an approach that disregards a lot of information that many traders assume to be useful, but, for instance, why would you use indicators that do not add to your analysis? Why would you listen to news that is old news and is already fully priced into the market? Why would you try to guess how complex fundamental factors might influence the price if you do not have the skills to fully understand those fundamentals? Why would you solicit opinions from traders who may trade with completely different styles and may be less competent and knowledgeable than you are? Traders do all of these things, but most of them do not make sense. Limit your scope to tools that truly add value.

Trading is all about emotions management. If you can manage your emotions and trade the best possible way you will get there. Your losing trade because of reason don't try to get your money back too quickly. I can see slow market now. waiting for next down move.

GU seems interesting, I think I am familiar with the possibilities of GU more than EU currently. Lots low risk entry we will get this end of October.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Its not about positive or negative thinking about your trading, It is about focus. If you keep your 100% focus one EU this week you make profit. If you look for indicators, pivots, Different course seller fancy name, if you focus on BS talk and chart with BS people you miss most of the entry and you lose money this week. Ask why your losing, I think people lose because they don't want to lose, at list it is true for me. when I get too much defensive I can't perform well. when you get too much offensive you may lose large and may gain big. As a traders we have to be aggressive but that aggressiveness should be pre plan. Fear of losing and Greed, how this 2 affect us most of us can't understand it. some people don't have awareness of this 2. Look at this chart nothing new, yet we could not do what is expected to do. we think other people know better than us, we think other people have better system than us. We have to think and act independently, we have to take full responsibilities.

A series of troublesome Brexit headlines have emerged in what has already been a volatile day in the forex space owing to the sensitivity to inflation worries and this notion that central banks are behind the curve. With that aside, however, specifically for the pound, ''Britain has begun preparations for a major clash with the EU by activating a key government committee to look at the fallout from suspending cooperation over Northern Ireland,'' Sky News has learnt and reported today. ''Ministers are holding discussions inside the key cabinet committee, which oversaw Brexit fallout preparations, about the repercussions of triggering Article 16, which allows the UK to stop following some parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol.'' ''The discussions on the practical implications of triggering the emergency mechanism in the Northern Ireland Protocol are being held in the "XO" cabinet committee, a pivotal institution inside government last year during Brexit talks when facing the threat of no-deal," the article said. In other news and related to the fallout, Britain said it had summoned France's ambassador in an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. "We regret the confrontational language that has been consistently used by the French government on this issue," said a statement from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office. It added: "As a next step, the Foreign Secretary has instructed Minister Morton to summon the French ambassador." The BBC wrote that ''Britain earlier denounced France's seizure of a British boat in French waters and warned Paris against further retaliation.'' The article continued, ''A British trawler has been seized by France and another has been fined, amid an escalating row over post-Brexit fishing rights. French maritime minister Annick Girardin said the ships were cautioned during checks off Le Havre overnight. She said the first did not comply right away and the second was not allowed to fish in French waters so was detained. No 10 said it was watching events closely and wanted France and EU talks but was ready to respond appropriately. Earlier, the environment secretary said he was "urgently" investigating the situation in relation to the detained vessel - which has been named as the Cornelis Gert Jan.'' Market implications It is well telegraphed that there are sticky and messy parts up in the air in the Brexit saga, most of which is likely already priced in, however, background stories and feelings of trouble escalation in the fall-out will leave the pound vulnerable. meanwhile, the markets are more aligned to what is happening between the central banks. Sterling firmed a touch on Thursday against the euro and the dollar as investors assessed whether the Bank of England would proceed with an interest rate hike at the upcoming meetings or hold fire, given concerns around economic growth. Markets are pricing a chunky 34 cumulative bps in rate hikes rise from the BoE by year-end. GBP/USD is higher by some 0.4% on the day wheel EUR/GBP is also 0.4% higher following the ECB's emphasis on inflation pressures.

Next Thursday, the Bank of England will have its monetary policy meeting. Analysts at ING expect a 15bp rate hike, following recent hawkish comments. They consider markets are overestimating the scale of future tightening, so they argue some modest pushback from policymakers in the form of lower medium-term inflation forecasts and a split rate hike vote, seems likely. Key Quotes: “Policymakers are likely to offer some modest pushback against the market's tightening expectations for 2022. That leads us neatly onto whether policymakers will attempt to lean more heavily against market pricing. We think they will, if only subtly.” “For one thing, if the committee does indeed opt to increase rates on Thursday, then it's unlikely to be a unanimous decision. While a handful of committee members will likely take Governor Bailey’s lead and vote for a rise, we know at least one member is likely to dissent (Silvana Tenreyro). This should be a warning sign for markets: if the first – partial – rate rise can’t command a unanimous decision, then it’s harder to see a series of aggressive, future moves gaining similar levels of support.” “When it comes to the forecasts, we may well see a downgrade to the inflation projections for two/three years' time. Don't forget that the Bank takes market interest rates and plugs them into its models. Back in August, a modest 40bp of tightening over its forecast horizon neatly kept inflation around 2% in the medium-term. All else equal, the much higher degree of tightening now priced into markets should result in that 2024 inflation forecast moving lower. If that happens, then it would be an implicit sign that policymakers don’t see a need to act as aggressively as the markets.” “GBP has undoubtedly benefited from the dramatic re-pricing of the UK money market curve since early September. However, the BoE’s broad, trade-weighted measure of GBP is up only 1.1% over the same period, so it seems fair to describe GBP gains as ‘hard-won’.”

Analysts at MUFG Bank are recommending a trade idea of shorting the EUR/USD pair with a target at 1.1300, an entry level of 1.1650 and a stop at 1.1850. They consider the EUR/USD could struggle to build on Thursday’s gains. Key Quotes: “The EUR bounced yesterday on a sense that ECB President Lagarde was less than enthusiastic in pushing back current market pricing for rate hikes next year. But senior central bankers rarely comment on specific market pricing and hence we did not view Lagarde as shifting the ECB stance in any way. We are in a market where investors are increasingly questioning the forward guidance of central banks – but we would argue that the ECB is on more credible ground than some of the other central banks and therefore a sustained divergence favouring a weaker EUR is likely to persist going forward.” “The focus next week will shift of course to the FOMC and while we do not get any formal updated guidance on rates, we will get the QE tapering plan, the statement and the press conference and it is likely that Fed Chair will talk tougher on inflation given developments of late. We don’t expect any huge shift in tone or message but enough to prompt some reversal of the heavy USD selling in evidence in October.” “Technically, EUR/USD is at an interesting point as well. The downtrend resistance on the daily intra-day chart from the highs in June and again in September comes in a little above the current spot rate (1.1706 today) and that could act to limit the upside over the short-term.”

Eu will move down I was expecting but yesterday the way mre move lower I don't expect that, I have few sell trade yesterday, I closed them I didn't swing them, I told here I am looking for 1.145 or 1.142 level, Some of the banks targeting 1.1300 levels. Lets see, over all Eur is weak,

--- 帖子 #129 ---
FX analysts at MUFG consider that the BoE could hike rates by 0.15% next week, although they warn about a negative GBP reaction: “Based on the recent FX response to central bank guidance we could well see GBP dismissing this guidance of slower tightening going forward. However, we would expect GBP to ultimately weaken on the back of a 15bp hike and guidance suggesting the need for less tightening than what is currently priced. That message may not be explicit but should be implied by the MPR forecasts.”

“How long are you going to wait before you demand the best of yourself?” You’re no longer a child but a full-grown person, and yet you procrastinate, Epictetus reminds himself “You will not notice that you are making no progress but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.” From nowon, he warns himself, and all of us, to live like a mature human being and never set aside what you think is best to do. And whenever you encounter anything difficult, remember that the contest is now, you are at the Olympics, you cannot wait any longer. We don't have the luxury of postponing our training, because unlike the Olympic Games, the contest we participate in every day—life—has already begun. Life is right now.

“Dig within. Within is the wellspring of Good; and it is always ready to bubble up, if you just dig.” - Marcus Aurelius Imagine the best version of yourself. Look inside, do you see and know who that highest version of you is, the one who acts right in all situations, the one who makes no mistakes and seems unbeatable? If you’re anything like me and have been trying to improve yourself, then you probably know this ideal version of yourself. Well, in Greek, this best version would be the inner daimon, an inner spirit or divine spark. For the Stoics and all other schools of ancient philosophy, the ultimate goal of life was eudaimonia, to become good (eu) with your inner daimon. (Not to be confused with demon, which is a bad spirit.)

Ok Lets understand GJ monthly chart, Price rejected 149 level many times and move up, That already happen. Now we see previously price move sharply lower form 160 level. we see this month price close below 157 and 156.50 level. if price close above this area we could buy but I don't see any buying below this area in Monthly chart. previous month close bullish, there will be common tendency that people will try to buy since market over all structure and momentum is up. Fundamentally also there is a reason for buy, But some traders like and love to buy the more deep pull back, we may get it, we may not get it.

In GJ weekly chart, I don't see any sell and I don't see any buy. It is too late to buy and To sell this market market must come little lower. Price over all directions is bullish. Last 2 week price couldn't close high of the previous candle. we have to focus on, BOE after Effect, Over all context is JPY week and GU strong, We have to understand market already discounted interest rate hike. we have to wait for BOE, How big players are thinking after BOE. We don't have to always buy low and sell high, we can buy high and make money.

In Daily chart I don't see any swing trade, I see lots of LTF scalping opportunity some day trade opportunity. In this market conditions if you marry your trade you will lose the trade. IMO You should take the profit, After taking few profitable trade you can hold few trade with stop BE, don't expect those will work out, expect your BE will taken out by market. In case you get lucky and price started to move sharply with one directions you will make big $$. Be aware of what is going on with GBP, this GJ will dominate by GBP sentiment

hasib. I can understand everything you are saying as it's the conventional way of analysing using previous pa and defining S/R but what I'm doing is totally not the norm but the way bbma interprets pa...with GY the weekly hasn't shown the retracement for a long whereas both the monthly and daily are signalling the upmove. The upmove on the monthly does have room for more and the daily has been bouncing off an area for long entries..just beware of what can happen and you will not be surprised..

Let me talk about system, There are many system to trade the market. I believe when simple and basic works there is no need to complicate, Complicated system are used by newbies. As a professional trader you have to reduce your variables, I see in FF lots of so called expert they introduce new variable every week, Newbies follow those and they have popularity. Since your not a course seller nor your interested to deceive new traders to make money from them. Just refine your basic. Traders lose money because of their basic problem. I see with 75% win rate people lose money. I have seen with 30% win rate traders making profit. so No need complicated system. People will tell you, You need to have a system, Let me tell you a truth- Your the system, Develop your self, Not indicator over indicator.

that's wrong thinking because I see UY going higher and the yen remains weak overall, so UY will bring other yen pairs up along though those currencies might be trending down against the dollar. If the dollar is also weak but strong enough against the yen all other yen pairs will move much faster and greater than UY

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I will sell GU if price retraces higher, no value in shorting now

I don't think you consider fundamentals in your trading. what I am trying to say is if you want to trade JPY weakness trade CJ not GJ. GBP has its uncertainty, don't you read Brexit stories and Before BOE buying I think is not a good idea at all. Of course it is my way. If you think your way profitable enough than buy. Another point are you buying for daily swing or just for H1 swing. I don't know that, I am assuming you are buying for D1 swing.

I do have fundamentals in mind when I am trading but having learned my lesson(s) from using "fundamentals" I have made it a point not to be influenced by this anymore. The only fundamental I adhere to is "the market can remain irrational far longer than I can remain solvent". I won't mind using "fundamentals" if I have the billions like Warren Buffet and the like..until I become one "fundamentals" will remain outside my trading room. I don't know if you remember the so called "gurus" and banks were calling for aud/usd par value and the aussie went up to 1.06.From my years trading the stock market I know for a fact how the stock is manipulated..Things like P/E ratio to value stocks, something you learn in accounting/economics seldom work in practice. Lots of gurus who talk about fundamentals think they understand how it works but it was just a good laugh for me, even wyckoff pattern of price manipulation has a flaw in it. Just stick to your chart and trade and leave all other things behind the door...all this bankers talk and projections are at best just as good as what you arrive at

with this method the previous candle printed a csd (candle stcik direction) when price closed below the mid bb..bbma traders will not jump in short now but to wait for a retracement to the 5/10 ema for a short..big traders will short heavy when price reaches the emas'..if price moves further down we just sit tight and wait for the retracement to come . There must be an entry to short when there is csd..this is "fundamental" to bbma trading

Most relax way of trading is daily chart trading, if you are not making money in small tf. I think you can try only daily chart trading. Study shows 2 reasons for retail trader lose 1. Over leveraging 2. Overtrading. By trading daily chart you can solve one problem, that is overtrading problem. If you have a good system, you can follow the system quite well. Your trading psychology also improve. Emanuel suggest me to have 2 account one is for day trading one is for daily chart trading. You can do the same, you will understand the difference.

Safest way is learn to manage risk and develop your trading skills. Dragon pattern, Dog pattern, Harmonic pattern, Stay out of those, You don't need any of those crappy, New traders get excited by knowing new name and new pattern. Instead of learning risk management, Proper trading behavior they learn years and years crap.

Dollar index out look here. S&amp;R works,

--- 帖子 #227 ---
The dollar is keeping a bit more mixed post-FOMC as it pares some losses against the euro and pound from yesterday after the initial reaction. But risk currencies are maintaining their advance, keeping flatter so far today as equities are in a good mood as the Fed reiterated patience when it comes to rate hikes. But importantly, the bond market reaction is one that is worth noting as long-end yields pull higher and the yield curve steepened slightly in the aftermath. 2-year Treasury yields are little changed and keeping around 0.47% to 0.48% while 10-year yields have moved up from 1.57% to 1.60% as we look towards the session ahead. That is keeping yen pairs buoyed with USD/JPY up 0.2% to 114.20 currently. I don't see this as a material turning point for dollar weakness whatsoever as the Fed pretty much delivered on expectations. It's all about the data now and how that will play into the Fed's narrative or if it will speed it up/slow it down. The bond market reaction will also continue to keep things interesting, especially to see if the market will view the Fed as making some form of policy mistake. But for risk trades, I'd argue it's still pretty much a buy-the-dip mentality for equities in the months ahead as even with the taper announcement, the Fed is still engaged with rather sizable QE regardless - at least for the time being.

Be careful with gold it is close to 1800 level, but market momentum is up. You can't buy as well as you can't sell. Big money is flowing in other places so Gold is absolute crap. Us30 don't trade it today, I see in other thread people are trading us30. I have my techniques in trading us30, My techniques telling me not to trade us30 as well. Before NFP gold will fuck Less inform trader, I am quite sure about it. Some traders love gold because of volatility, I like that too. Gold has a challenge that is some time market dries, volatility shrink and momentum fades. US30 has more challenge, It has no consistent market range. If fundamentals support it fly in the sky. It is very challenging for traders. With my all years of experience, I can tell you FX major is the best way to speculate. For investment best is Stock index.

Look at this simple chart, why you try to buy here, If I buy in this low and lose money, I will tell myself an idiot. Some of the idiots are just don't understand Technical and Nor they understand Fundamentals. They understand one think, they will become millionaire and billionaire. If you tell them to use MA, They will start acting smart, Like - MA is lagging indicator, Truth is they can't outperform MA. They will tell you, use Pivot, this level that level, Their account will show what levels they belong.

MOVING AVERAGES If you want to really understand the tools you are using and how they will react to extreme situations, it helps to understand how they will react in the most simple, basic contexts as well. Of course, everyone grasps the basics of moving averages: add higher prices and the average will go up. When price flattens out, the average eventually will flatten, too. When price turns down, it will cut through the moving average, and, at some point, it will start pulling the average down with it. This is all simple, but it is not the point. The point is to build an intuitive and intimate understanding of the behavior of the average as it responds to changing market data. One of the best ways I have found to foster this intuition with any technical tool is to generate simple price patterns in artificial price series, and then to plot the indicator on this synthetic price data. (Nearly all charting packages allow users to import ASCII data, but if this is not possible, the indicator may be calculated directly in an Excel spreadsheet and graphed there.) Think of this as a controlled laboratory experiment: you are controlling the data that is fed to the indicator so you can begin to understand the details of the indicator’s reactions to that data. This process, along with careful thought and reflection, will build an understanding that goes beyond a simple understanding of the patterns on the screen. The charts that follow are examples of this process. There is value in these specific examples, but it is even more important that you can take the procedure and adapt it to your own use. These examples show both 20-period simple moving averages (SMAs) and exponential moving averages (EMAs) to compare their behavior and fluctuations. The formulas required to build these indicators are already available from many books or the Internet, so they will not be a focus in this chapter, but you must have a clear conceptual understanding of the behavioral differences between the two. The simple moving average simply averages the price over a look-back window. It is completely blind to any data outside of that window, which creates the first potential issue: a simple moving average moves twice in reaction to any single large event. The value of the moving average has a change both when the event occurs and when it passes out of the left side of the evaluation window. The EMA is a considerably more complex animal. Recent data are weighted more heavily in an EMA, and, technically, no data points are ever dropped from the average. Rather than being dropped, past data is rolled off with an exponential decay. In actual practice, the effect of distant past data far out of the evaluation period of the average is so small that it is insignificant, but it is still there. It is important to realize, though, that this effect smoothes the left-hand side of the evaluation window—an EMA will not jump twice as a simple moving average will. This is one of the main advantages of the EMA over the SMA.

Look at this chart, you know that they lose money. When people started to counter the momentum without understanding the price structure, market context, i hate it, pivot traders when price come to their level they open trade with out any context analysis. They have big dd, some of them lose money only trading pivot. I have previously post all the prove, i know people still trade counter trend with pivot level. Some people just don't realize the fact.

When Market is trending there is no better tools than EMA. When Market is cycling there is no best way than trading Supply and demand or support and resistance. When market is choppy, there is no best way than stop trading and observing what market is doing. From fundamentals you will find market trend not from past price. Price move because of future expectations not because past price.

You have a system but you don't follow it There are few reason behind that, Let me explain from my experience. 1. You don't back test your system properly. 2. You think other people has better edge than you, Lack of confidence. 3. You risk too much in your system signal. 4. You don't understand the market, You don't understand the trading game, good enough. 5. Your emotions influence your trading decisions 6. Before adding or removing any part of your system you don't follow proper process.

8 November 2021, Monday. Daily chart swing trading. Gold shifted Median line Break out. If it is fake out I will close the trade before sl hit. 1831 is Resistance it is 4th time touching shifted median line. expecting this time it will break out. Fundamentally gold should move up too. I may lose this trade, I accept that. I am not fortune teller. So manage your risk. Large stop doesn't mean Big % risk, I adjust my lot size according to TF and SL.

So you’ve been trading on a demo account for months now and you think you’re ready to go live. But are you REALLY ready? Here are signs you should look for: 1. You can make profits CONSISTENTLY. Making consistent profits and winning ALL the time aren’t the same. There ain’t a single renowned forex trader who can say that he hasn’t lost a single trade in his entire trading career. Given the market’s ever-changing market conditions, losing is part of the battle. So if you’ve lost a trade or two this week, don’t beat yourself up. Rather, focus on honing your skills in finding high-probability setups with decent reward-to-risk ratios and come up with strategies that will help you minimize your losses and maximize your wins. Make sure you also monitor your profitability on your demo account each month. That way, you’ll know if you’re on the right track and so that it will be easier for you to see what you need to work on. 2. You have clear risk management rules that you stick to all the time. They say that 50% of your success in trading is determined by your ability to find good setups. The other 50% rests on proper risk management. With that said, having a well-thought out set of risk management rules is also a must-have on my checklist. There will always be times when the market goes wild, making you doubt your analysis and trading skills. During these instances which test your mental toughness, your risk management plan may be the only thing that could protect your account. Before you start to think about going live, you should make sure you’ve got a well-defined set of rules which tell you when you’ve lost enough or you’ve been trading too much or else, you’ll just wreck yo’ self. If you haven’t outlined your risk management rules yet, you can start by including percentage risk, the maximum drawdown you can tolerate, and when to stop trading after a series of losses in your trading journal. 3. You don’t lose your cool when your trade is losing. Do you still panic when your trade is going against you? If you do, you may want to re-think about investing your hard-earned moolah. I know, I know, it’s no easy task to keep your cool when you see that you’re losing money. So what should you do? Make a detailed trading plan and follow it! By having a plan to focus on, you will be able to think clearly and evaluate what has changed in your trade since you saw the setup or if the fundamentals have shifted in order to help you decide whether to hold on or not. 4. You don’t take your losses too hard. In the event that you do wind up with a dent on your account, you don’t take it too hard on yourself no matter how small or huge the loss is. Instead, you keep your cool and identify what went wrong and which technical and fundamental factors affected your trade. Bear in mind that such level-headedness is usually achieved, not only when you plan your trades properly and calculate your risk beforehand, but after consistently doing it for some period of time. There’s no substitution to achieve success other than deliberate practice and gaining experience.

Just Because It's Simple, Doesn't Mean It's Easy "The key to trading success is emotional discipline. If intelligence were the key, there would be a lot more people making money trading." -Victor Sperandeo 2020 has been one of the most incredible, volatile and interesting trading seasons I've experienced. Having sold my portfolio weeks before the bloodbath, I was very happy at that time to dodge the 40+% downward spiral in stocks. Unfortunately, when the rebound began, my trigger finger misfired and the opportunity cost was severe. Every Tom, Dick and Harry were of the opinion that a v-shaped recovery was "impossible". I should have known better and followed the setups more closely but bought into the fear and paid the price. It Was Unavoidable Even though I abstained from traditional and social media, it was near impossible to avoid the "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!" rhetoric that was festering all over the globe. This fear parayezed me as well and I bought and sold far too many stocks on the same day to avoid losing instead of leaving emotions at the door. All because I tried to avoid losing instead of following my plan. What's worse - the setups conformed to my plan, I even bought many of them, but my conviction to the rules was weak at best. Missing out on over $255k in upside (without hindsight bias) forced me into action, this was a weed in my trading that had to be pulled out and destroyed forever. It's all About Learning When you miss monster runs there are a number of feelings, emotions and regrets that overload the senses. The "if I only" or "I should have" self-talk becomes pervasive to the point of mini-traumas we put ourselves through. It can set a dangerous precedent going froward, some people then: Buy the stock/asset too high outside of an entry window, FOMO in. Are too disappointed with missing the first train to take the second - there are always entry opportunities, so they miss it yet again Don't take any trades at all that week or month because they feel emotionally stretched Buy lower quality or random stocks to compensate for the loss Pile on too much position size to get revenge on the missed opportunities So the initial feeling of helplessness perpetuates poor behaviour. Defeating all of these impulse reactions enabled me to get back into some of these positions safely and still make money this year. It was very hard to get to this point though. It also taught me something more valuable than any "Guru" course or other method could ever have - don't make assumptions and follow the plan! I am referring to the real plan, not the one we create in our heads, the ones we write down, execute and repeat day in and day out. Assumptions - Fear Based Thinking As I stood on the sidelines in disbelief trying to figure out why stonks were rallying , I realized something pretty ground-breaking ... It doesn't fucking matter why? It matters that they are or aren't! Price action &gt; Opinion. As humans we try to extrapolate scenarios, instances and want to outsmart the stock market to make more money. It's easy to forget that the stock market itself is a discounting mechanism of future price. So our attempts to be smarter than AI systems, trillion dollar institutions and other participants moves us from from statistically sounds plans into presumptuous "this time it's different" ideation. So we buy a stock, set our stop loss and then do almost everything in our power to go against our trading system . The following ensues: Moving up stop losses too soon because "Corona" Reacting violently to any sell off "This is the big one" Taking profits too soon out of fear of loss due to prior traumas - from not trading our plan in the first place! In general, this mental chatter where we go back and forth is high maintenance fear based trading. It is the opposite of the calm, system based and professional approach needed to make significant returns and turn this into a business. The good news is, just like taking out the weeds (not the smokeable type), our garden gradually develops and we have the higher quality decisions left to nurture and develop. This really is trading incarnate and what the experience is all about. Quick Note on Your System Just a quick note on your trading system and or the people you follow; Even if you have the best trading system in the world and it has statistical validity. It doesn't mean that you can trade it. If these knee-jerk reactions and poor discipline patterns aren't resolved, no system at all will be able to make you money. This is why the ultimate trading weapon is.... you! Defining and creating a plan that links and syncs with who you are is more important than any system. When you get to breakeven and start the weed removal process, the dollars roll in more frequently and the feeling of doom is replaced by a feeling of "I'm finally getting this". So What Trades Did I Miss or Fumble Allow me to indulge you in some lost opportunity porn, this year was particularly brutal: Zoom Video Communications (ZM): ZM was a particularly painful trade. I went in over-sized (so put on a whopper of a position) within my risk parameters. The following day I stepped back in amazement as the stock gapped up and took off. My sell points are above, not the worst sell points but certainly not to my rules. Even though it was a 45% winner simply by removing my assumptions and emotions from the trade and sticking to the plan, this could have been a 324% win. So $4.5k of winnings vs a potential $32,400 gain. I love this information because I know what not to do next time. Adopting a growth mindset, still making some money and preparing for my next trade! By trying to avoid losing my gains, I lost out on them - trading is paradoxical in this sense. FIVERR Fiverr International Ltd (FVRR): If you thought the previous one stung, let me introduce you to my ultimate missed bus. Fiverr. This one I am super salty about. I was sure this stock would hit the sky and loved how it made sense as a CV 19 play. It setup the most perfect buy point and in my head was "too good to be true". I took the below trade, the stock went up 18% the next day and for some reason, I dumped it all. Sure 18% beats the -.05% we get with banks but the real issue here - I did not follow my plan! Having been elated about a quick 18% in one day, I sat back in wonder as to why I sold, it didn't give any sell signal and I was acting like an elated teenager. As my key rule is to not sell until it closes below the 50 MA two days in a row, the ensuing move was rather painful - technically i should still be in this trade. As you can see - this one hurts a lot. I had a $12k position in this stock, made around $2,000 and walked away. This would have run up $60,000 had I stayed in my position and my account would be up in the mid triple digits. No Audi R8 this year. Again, same theme. Making assumptions, watching news and being scared to commit to my plan. Probably the worst part of all these trades is that they were part of my system, the system was not a problem here, it was how I manged my emotions and let fear drive my decision making. There Were More I won't labor the point as even writing this down takes me into a loser mindset. The message should be clear though. Every time we try and avoid losing by doing things outside of our trading system, trying to be smarter than the stock market or acting on fear - the probabilities and statistics are no longer in our favor. Opportunities to Understand Your System I's absolutely imperative at this point to identify why loss aversion leads to losses in trading and relate it back to your trading system. Any time we manipulate, change or make an assumption, it's game over and our emotional saboteurs are in the driver seat. Just like any terrible situation in life, the very thing we try and avoid becomes what we focus or what arrives. Our brain is using it's primitive survival instincts to override objectivity. The spiral then begins as the things we hate start showing up time and time again, the pull into this frame of mind is toxic and luckily, not necessary. Consider These Changes to Stay on Track I have found during my reflections that typically, if I moved or changed my strategy it was due to the same issues, almost every time. The primary one was my fear of loss. this helped me realise that one of the most notable things I was doing was trading too large and welding my character to my bank account. Associating your personal worth with your P&amp;L is an unhealthy way to look at the market. Every time I thought I would lose something, the voices in my head would sound like this: "You are a fraud, you are going to lose this money and then what!" "Wow, that was $500 you could have used for something else" "What will your family think if you lose that money" And so on and so forth. This crystallized a few things that I used to trade going forward which have reduced my trauma from the stock market and also helped me remain objective: 1. Position Size Typically, if people are chopping and changing ideas they have too much money at stake in the market. I began halving my position size on this premise and within days noticed I was more relaxed and stopped messing with my plan! Overall, I never want to lose more than $500 on any given trade, this means with my 1% rule that a $50k account is the sweet spot for me to get aggressive, as the account builds up gains, my 1% rule then applies to the new account size. So when I am up to say $75k, my new 1% risk is $750. This has kept me out of trouble on so many occasions and something everyone should do or consider. The amount of traders who do not protect themselves with risk management is mind blowing. Trading is risk management! Trading too large is like having a Lambo engine in a go-cart. It works great until you hit a fucking wall. 2. Too Many Positions If you have too many positions on, the same issue can occur. Should I do this, should I buy that. All of these self-destructive voices about missing out, not being in the big winners and chopping and changing between stocks. Basically looking at other people and picking up tips and being a "Twidiot" - blindly following idiots on Twitter. My rule is simple on this one, if I have more than 6% of my account at risk at any one point if my stops were hit, I can't take on more positions. This keeps me in fewer names but more concentrated on meticulous research into price action of the ones I buy. 3. Reflection and Journals If you aren't sick of me mentioning journals then this may be my first blog you've read. Journals are the absolute pinnacle of professional reflection and trading. Show me a professional trader, sportsman or plumber that does not run his or her business with some kind of metrics, measurement and feedback loop. My journal has pointed out some of the largest blind spots in my approach to trading and is something everyone should and can do. Combine this with marked up charts, entry points and rationale and over time the correct behaviors and flaws begin exposing themselves en mass. This entire blog and why I sell too soon was sparked from one of these personal reviews. 4. Writing Down my Plan and Marking Charts This is the simplest one of them all. Before taking a trade I write down an if then and plan around the trade. An example below: Buy GOOG at 1818 Set stop loss at 1760 Has good price action and reducing volume since prior breakout High relative strength vs overall market Close to ATH Not too extended from 20 Day MA My entry is defined and I have a small story around buying the stock. Very simple but I've caught myself with some dumbshit entries which would have almost ruined me if I bought on impulse. As someone who suffers from impulse decisions. Summary Loss aversion and trading are intermingled very nicely due to the nature of money and it's huge impact on emotions. As a trader it is super important to acknowledge the emotions, drivers and reasons we do what we do. Part of the problem is people expect various things from trading but have no real plan or aren't executing the plan they do have. the reality and nature of the market dictates that without this plan or having a clear and repeatable strategy - you are essentially gambling. If you've struggled with loss aversion and are constructing your own demise financially it's time to put some steps in place to protect your psyche first and in parallel your trading account. If you don't, you will go through a series of waves between emotion and despair. I made the decision to stop being up, down, left and right about trading. Rooting out the fear and assumptions that create loss instead of avoid it has been a life changing process that just keeps getting better! https://blog.redpilltrades.com/

Those who are new, I want to explain one simple idea, When price is over extended wait for 10 LWMA low touch than Buy. See the picture. BBMA Strategy creator is a smart man, He has better market understanding than most of the people here. He read and understand various trading concept that is why he don't use break out instead he use market slow down to enter trend continuations. I only like Trend continuations entry of BBMA not other entry. If you think other entry is good you can use, I suggest trade what works for you. I am Trend continuations trader most of the time. Yes you can use other ways to enter the market, I can give you many other ways to enter the same time but everything is pointless if you don't test it by yourself, It is not black box, It requires judgment. Judgment will develop with in you, when you give quality time in chart and Fundamentals.

Hi Every one!! Hope you all good. Re-starting my trading activity after some break and looking for calm thread where i can add my charts/ideas and exchange opinions. I'm only looking at GY and mainly trading on the short term. Using pitch forks, Fibs and S&amp;R.. 152.8 it's strong support, it's ML of the fork and last week lows.. looking to buy any retest at this area (125.8/153).. breaking and holding the 153.50 (can present good sell scalps) will put target around 154.7.. Break

Cool, I posted the 2 charts for AU &amp; GA but idk why they didn't post. Sorry that was my first post I did with a image and maybe only my 2nd post ever lol. I Didn't know I had to click insert lol Let's try again... I closed my trade on GA at 1.8383 with manual stop when I seen signs of reversal around 20:23. So only got around 33pips instead of 50pips as planned if it hit 1.8400.. I didn't save screenshot. Will get back in around 1.8425 if closes above price with uptrend. AU still in trade and still shorting @0.7375, TP is @.7300... I saw signs of reversal so I reduced position from 0.7425 entry and got out of new entry but ended up hoping back in afterwards.. I was unsure of the trade but went back in a minute later because I'm trusting my plan. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Welcome here, I like serious trader, I don't let idiots post here. Here are some of my view, 1. Trade what ever strategy you like, but have a good MM plan. 2. Discuss and share your idea by doing this you can become good at what your doing. 3. Have good circle don't hangout with losing trader, you will become loser. 4. Keep it simple, know market conditions and expectations that are driving traders sentiment. 5. Control your self, After losing few trade stop, develop this mind set and mantel fortitude.

After 5 years expert trader still trading and average trader quit trading and work for others.

Fear of losing trade. 2. Fear of losing account balance 3. Fear of not becoming successful trader. 4. Fear of losing profit. 5. Fear of losing floating profit 6. Fear of missing trade. 7. Fear of Market conditions change 8. Fear of economic calendar news 9 Fear of Not getting social recognitions as a trader “We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.” – Seneca

Growth forecasts from Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs sees the global economy growing 4.5% next year as the recovery from covid-19 continues. That's in line with estimates but the composition diverges. In particular, they see the UK growing at 5.3% compared to the 5.0% consensus while they forecast China at 4.8% compared to 5.5% expected. The see that paradigm continuing into 2023 as well. On China they say: The key driver of this muted outlook is a negative swing in the property sector growth impulse from an average of +1½pp in the last five pre-pandemic years to just above -1pp in 2022 and beyond. This reflects the negative impact of deleveraging on construction, consumption, government spending, real estate services, and construction materials activity They note that China would have previously stimulated aggressively but now they're content to 'just do enough' to stem downward risks as they put less weight on GDP growth and more on income distribution, financial stability and the environment.

the reason I sold UChf was based on the weekly..after printing a csd I just waited for price to retrace to the ema for an entry. This is considered a good entry after a csd , the other entry(good entry) is when a csm (candle stick momemtum) is printed. With a csm we do the same thing and that is to wait for price to retrace back to the ema for an entry.. .the csm will come after my entry after the csd ..when you don't get a csm after the entry I did it means price is losing momentum to the downside and price will probably retrace upwards..let's see if we get a csm printed..this is the weekly and so it takes time

Investing.com -- Concerns over elevated inflation look likely to remain to the fore in the coming week with investors looking ahead to the latest U.S. retail sales figures along with earnings results from major retailers, including Walmart. The latest set of economic data out of China on Monday is expected to confirm a slowdown in its economic recovery, just as Europe is experiencing a fresh surge in Covid-19 infections. Meanwhile, UK employment numbers will be closely watched after the Bank of England said it wanted more evidence of improvement in the labor market when it surprised markets by failing to deliver a widely expected rate hike earlier this month. Here’s what you need to know to start your week. U.S. retail sales The highlight of the week’s economic calendar will be October retail sales data, due out on Tuesday, with economists expecting an increase of 1.1%, after a 0.7% rise in September. U.S. inflation has surged to the highest level in over thirty years amid a global supply chain crunch and data on Friday showed that consumer sentiment fell to its lowest in a decade this month, as higher prices eroded living standards. Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sooner than currently indicated to stop inflation spiraling upward. The economic calendar also features data on industrial production on Tuesday, reports on housing starts and building permits on Wednesday and the weekly figures on initial jobless claims on Thursday. Retail earnings Third quarter earnings season is continuing to wind down, but investors will get an additional update on the strength of consumer spending this week with results from major retailers, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Macy’s (NYSE:M). The earnings reports will face extra scrutiny ahead of the start of the holiday shopping season, with investors looking at guidance from retailers to determine whether inflation will eat into profits or be passed on to consumers. Third quarter earnings season has largely been upbeat. Reuters reported that as of Friday, 459 of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported, with 80% of earnings results beating analysts’ forecasts. China slowdown The recovery in the world’s number two economy is weakening and data on Monday, which includes reports on retail sales, fixed asset investment and industrial production is expected to confirm this. The loss of momentum in China, a key driver of global growth, is casting a shadow over the uneven global economic recovery from the pandemic. The recovery in China has been hit by an aggressive approach to containing Covid-19 outbreaks, a massive debt crisis in the country’s real estate sector and an energy crunch that has weighed on manufacturing activity. Analysts think the country’s central bank is likely to take a cautious approach to loosening monetary policy to bolster the economy as slowing growth combined with soaring inflation fuel concerns over stagflation. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden is to hold a virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday, amid rising tensions between the world’s two largest economies. However, U.S. officials have downplayed hopes for any progress on trade. UK jobs data The BoE has indicated that it wants more information on the strength of the UK labor market before hiking rates for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, so the latest jobs report on Tuesday will be in sharp focus. The October jobs data will show if there was an increase in unemployment after a pandemic-era wage subsidy scheme expired at the end of September. The jobs data will be followed by inflation numbers on Wednesday and retail sales figures on Friday. With inflation expected to continue accelerating for now the BoE may proceed with a rate hike at its December meeting, barring any unexpected weakness in the labor market data. Pandemic resurgence hits Europe Europe is seeing a resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic, adding to headwinds for the region’s already fragile economic recovery. Europe accounts for more than half of the average 7-day infections globally and about half of latest deaths, according to data compiled by Reuters, the highest levels since April last year when the virus was at its initial peak in Italy. Several countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic are implementing restrictions or planning fresh measures to slow the spread. Holland entered a three-week partial lockdown on Saturday, the first in Western Europe since the summer. Germany reintroduced free Covid-19 tests on Saturday and Austria is to decide on Sunday whether to impose a lockdown on people who are not vaccinated. --Reuters contributed to this report

Latest data released by ONS - 17 November 2021 Prior +3.1% Core CPI +3.4% vs +3.0% y/y expected Prior +2.9% The pound is jumping on the beat in the report, with cable moving up from 1.3435 to 1.3470 as EUR/GBP dips just below 0.8400 as well. The hot inflation numbers above will just serve to reaffirm expectations that the BOE should hike rates next month. Looking at the details, the largest contribution to the surge in annual inflation for the month of October comes from housing and household services, with further jumps seen in transport and restaurants and hotels. The latter is largely due to base effects amid the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme introduced last year, with the inflation contribution in this division being the largest since January 2006.

I use the 4H for trend and 30M for entry. Sell because 4H trend is down, and we have had a retrace back to a solid resistance. I got sell on 30M indicator so I have already in a sell position. I know it my continue upwards because the EUR have been weak so far this week at we may soon get a retrace or reversal on EURGBP (EUR get stronger). But as long as the winning % is above 50 and the winners are larger than the looses is not a problem.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I working on making my trading system as mechanical as possible to avoid emotion when I'm trading. I was commenting on hasib question but I do not use the information about the resistance my self. I only care about the trend indicator on 4H, the entry indicator on 30M, that I have a retracement on 4H (use HA candles for this), and that I do not trade into a level. To exit I also use an indicator. In this way my emotion is low, and only a few things to consider before entry.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi Kirinda I can see Eurcad break below the level and now it is touching previous level, It is obvious that selling with a small stop is good idea how ever I don't see any selling momentum(H1 chart) in EC right now. I can see market slow down, If price break above 1.43 area we could buy for 20 to 30 pips or even more we will tell our self that move down is false break out. Here comes to fundamentals, Fundamentals is only leading information, not any technical level or indicator. So far we know oil is slow down and Cad should be strong Sooner or letter, EUR is weak there are several fundamental reason for that. BTW price is below 200 hours moving average too. In my view either we should stay sideline or sell, there is not buy I see in my chart. I will no buy EC, if price go up I will sell from up, You know we don't have to trade every single swing of the market. I personally like to trade dominant swing of the market that is why I don't like pivot or I don't like to trade corrective swing of the market. To trade impulsive move of the market requires market understanding and firm convictions of the market over all directions. Fundamentals helps to grow strong directions bias. Most importantly trading impulsive move of the market obvious and simple but we like to complicate our trading opening too many trade and too many ideas.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Trading level is not a problem there are many big traders are trading levels, yes many Quant traders don't like levels at all some quant traders use level too. So there is nothing wrong level trading. Another point is my sentiment indicator told 72% of the traders are buying EC, You know most of the time most of those traders lose money.

very unique way of trading kirinda but just looking at H4 I notice if you trade the break of your trend indicator (at candle close) you can make some money too

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Then you have 4H as entry timeframe, and then you can use daily as trend timeframe.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I mean just trading one tf like the H4 and not bothered with another tf..you should know better ,it's your indicator and you must have tested over and over again

The New York Fed president John Williams is speaking and tilted more toward the hawkish side: We are seeing broader based increases in inflation Even after taking into account basic facts, we have seen a pickup in underlying inflation in the US Long-run inflation expectations reversed earlier declines and are at levels seen in 2013 to 2014 Supply constraints are a major factor on the labor market and supply chain bottlenecks Feds framework is well suited for this because it starts up from the point of making sure inflation expectations are anchored at 2% The economy is going back higher inflation is making it more expensive to put food on the table Fed's focused on making sure there is a strong healthy economy with low and stable inflation The rapid development in the crypto currency space and stable can provides opportunities for positive effects, but at the same time financial stability risks can be identified in that space cyber risks to the financial system are not going away Dow industrial average is trading down -153 points. The NASDAQ index remains positive by 30 points. The S&amp;P is currently up 4.64 points. On November 12 Williams said: There are segments of the labor force that are more protected against inflation and others less so People on fixed incomes are less protected against inflation Fed officials have to understand the effects of climate issues on financial stability in terms of supervision and regulation Fed officials are focused on inequality and equitable growth because they are important to the economy

Why Can't I Follow My Trading System? Perhaps the most common concern I hear from traders is that of "discipline": following one's trading plans, rules, signals, and/or system. Sometimes the lapses from discipline involve failing to take trades that are indicated. Other times, the problem is one of overtrading: taking trades that lie outside one's rules. If we think of lapses of discipline in other areas--cheating on a diet, for example, or procrastinating on work that needs to be completed--we can see that, many times, we act against our longer-term self-interest by becoming caught up in shorter-term needs. If, for example, we cannot tolerate boredom, we might eat to fill the void and break our diet. Ignoring those short-term needs, as a whole, doesn't work. Unmet, they eventually sabotage those longer-term intentions. We can tell ourselves that we'll do nothing but work all day, but other needs will inevitably creep in. Even if we don't act on them directly, we'll play them out in daydreams and escape work that way. When discipline works, it's often because people have found constructive ways to meet those short-term needs. The smoker who craves a cigarette may chew gum as a substitute oral activity. I enjoy sipping on a hot drink while I'm working, but too much coffee can get me wired and that gets in the way of the work. Now, as I'm writing this, I'm sipping my herbal tea. The key to sustaining discipline is to identify the specific short-term needs that are occasionally overshadowing trading rules. Once you've made that identification, it is easier to then brainstorm constructive ways of addressing those needs. Traders who overtrade, for example, often have problems during quiet market times. Their needs are for stimulation. By creating stimulating activities during the trading day that don't take them away from their screens, they can avoid using unwanted market activity as their stimulation. This is one reason that teamwork and training at trading firms can be so valuable: they provide a constructive focus for traders apart from trading, especially during slow times. At one prop shop, Trading RM in Chicago, traders actively call out their "special trades" and make teamwork and interaction a routine part of the trading day. It's a little more difficult to avoid good trades and put on bad ones if you're sharing your actions with your colleagues! Other times, traders fail to follow their rules because they don't truly have confidence in their ideas. They front-run their own signals out of anxiety and wait for perfection in setups before they act. Their short-term needs often are for safety and security: they need to believe in what they're doing. Very often this problem occurs when traders have short-circuited their learning curves. They are putting meaningful capital at risk before they've done the paper trading and small real-time trading needed to build a successful track record. You believe in your system when you see, in your own experience, that it works over time, across market conditions. In general, I've found the cognitive and behavioral methods outlined in the Daily Trading Coach to be particularly helpful for discipline issues.

Trading is not about win rate and high risk reward, It is more than that, It is strong believe in your self and your method, In bad time and in a good time. Implementations of trading method is crucial than have good return in a week or months. Don't get excited by watching 65% return in a month, if they could consistently do it they would be Number 1 reach man in the world but they are not they come here in ff and show off. In this Social media boom world, every one try to show off rather than developing skills, our focus shift from great work to silly work. We all like to think we are best as a human even when we are not. As example see Average IQ of different country people, you will see High average IQ country is not US, UK, China, or Russia.

As a global macro even trader, You have to do 1. You have to understand chart ( most simple one) 2. you have to understand over all market context what events are moving the market. As a retail traders you will not understand all of the market moving reason, but If your focus enough you will understand some market conditions better than others. your job will risk little higher when your understanding market conditions. 3. Advantage of macro trading is, you will understand what market to avoid or what market to trade much better than only technical trader. Remember only technical traders are blind traders they manage risk and rewards. Anyone can become technical trader that is easy but understanding market with fundamentals events requires time and effort. 4. You will not always right but when your right you will have confidence to hold the trade since you have clear picture what is going on over all. 6. Economic Calendar is a part of fundamentals but not give complete picture, you will see after coming positive news market react opposite there are specific reason for that if you don't understand market over all context you will blame fundamentals don't work. Remember market moves because of fundamentals not because of your chart told that price will move certain directions. 7. There is no Leading technical indicator, Technical indicator can't lead price, if any one told you that pivot or any other indicator is leading indicator, Just stay out of them they are newbies. 8. without proper understanding fundamentals and market context, you can't hold trade for few days because you will always be worried this candle pattern or that indicator signal will change market opposite.

In daily chart I can see audusd in a range, As long as 72 hold I think it will move towards 75. In H4 chart I can see 3 lag, now probably market will slow down or start trying to move up next week.

Hi pips yes AUD is weak, NZ is strong. but AUD have clean chart than NZ. I have bought NZ usd, I am playing Range.

GA, it is shifted from up side momentum to range momentum. If it is a range buying from top side of the range is always risky if break out don't happen it will be losing trade. If you want to buy it, I think you have to follow breakout strategy. If price come close to lower side of the range we could buy with small stop

Do you close the trade with small profit ? 3. Do you let the trade hit your stop ? 4. Do you pray and hope and read about fundamentals to validate your point? 5. Do you see previous back test data to validate your view? 6. Do you increase your stop loss so that it become day trade to swing trade? 7.

EU, There is still lots of room to move down in weekly chart. If you can trade 2 currency pair, You don't need to trade Stock index, gold, Crypto, other instrument. Just become good at 2 currency pair, If it is major pair it will help you a lot. You don't need indicators at all, Indicators is not system it can't be a system. Your MM, RM, Exit and entry all together is system. I can teach many indicator and discuss about many indicator here I know some of the idiot will buy those things and lose money. Forget all those crap, Use clean chart observe, observe, You will improve your trading as your gain more and more experience with your chosen market. Your first target will be win 20% of your trade with 1 to 2 RR. Once you get it consistently than you will target littler more. There is no bad entry there is only Bad exit and Bad risk management.

Look at this trading performance he is losing more and more in EC, UJ. I think he should stop trading those pair but I don't know he has the brain to follow my simple advice or not. I advice him just trade 2 major pair, Lower your expectations. make your risk management and trade management emotions free. Use stop, and don't touch your trade until stop and tp hit. I hope he will learn from me, if He fail to learn you can learn from this advice.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
If you too much care about your win rate and each and every trade you open your not going to make it. Trust me on that. Just let your trade hit stop or if your lucky it will hit tp. There is no bad entry you can enter anywhere in the market, There is only bad risk management and bad trade management. Trading success don't depends on TA, FA, it depends on your management skills. EU sell, I will let the market hit sl or tp. either way I am ok with that.

I have to correct you as we don't wait for a pullback to the mid bb but only to the MA...as I don't trade using H1 I did not see the squeeze..when you are looking at H1 you could have gone down he ltf like M5 or M15 to get in like what I marked on the chart..looks like you are applying the uses/functions of the bb more than the MMA.

yes, of course I watch weekly tf, specially current candle and previous candle. I focus on price above or below week, daily, h4 open line and how much price move away out from open line. I read price structure that is why I feel like every indicator is funny. When you can read structure with in structure you don't have to trade every single move of the market. Just like I am not buying eu today, eu is moving up nicely today. I open trade in h1 change.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Before you installing indicator you have to have a trading philosophy. For example if your trading philosophy is counter the directional move you can use pivot or other tools. My trading philosophy is not counter the directional move instead playing the directional force move with a better price, I counter the short term move. if you have no trading philosophy you will trade stupid indicator like TDI you will get in every where and lose money. some traders trade only breakout, that is also very good way, just you have to select right market. Trading success depends on emotion control and stress control ability. In small tf like m15 and h1 trading only those chart, you cannot manage your self forget about trade management.

"Balance Checkers In my experience, traders who are obsessed with the value of their accounts during the course of a trading day are destined for failure in the commodity and forex markets. The reason deals with the nature of the leveraged markets. Undue concern with one’s account value will override market judgment and lead to defensive trading. Defensive trading never works. To be successful in the commodity markets a trader needs to focus on trading the markets (not his or her equity balance) within a framework of proper money and trade management (these subjects will follow). Trading commodity and forex markets is not for you if you would need to check your account balance frequently. The Emotionally Unfit The commodity markets take no prisoners. If a person has a major character or emotional defect, the commodity markets will uncover and exploit it. Successful trading is an upstream swim or uphill run against human nature. It is fair to say that consistently profitable market operations require that a trader learn to overcome strong emotional pulls. In fact, most professional traders can relate how many of their most successful trades required action in direct opposition to emotional urges. Individuals whose emotions have led them into troubled financial decisions, personal habits, or relationships should avoid commodity trading at all costs. Trading commodity and forex markets are hard enough without carrying a load of emotional baggage" Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Overall Risk Management Successful trading operations are dictated primarily by how risk is managed. Many novice commodity traders assume each trade will be a winner. Professional traders manage their trading to assume that each trade may be a loser. Obviously, there is a major difference between the two perspectives. The Factor Trading Plan operates with several global assumptions, including: I have no idea where any given market is headed. I may think I know, but in reality I do not know. History has shown that my degree of certainty about a given market’s direction is inversely correlated with what actually happens. In fact, I think a trader with excellent money management practices could take the other side of trades in which I have a strong belief and make money consistently. About 30 to 35 percent of my trades over an extended period of time will be profitable. The probability of my very next trade being profitable is less than 30 percent. As many as 80 percent of my trades over shorter periods of time will be unprofitable. There is a high probability each year that I will incur eight or more losing trades in a row. There will be losing weeks, losing months, and even losing years in my trading operations. Important risk management guidelines have been incorporated into the Factor Trading Plan to address these global assumptions. The primary guideline is that the risk on any given trade is limited to 1 percent of trading assets, and preferably closer to half of 1 percent of assets. Because I think in incremental units of $100,000, this means that my risk per trade per unit of $100,000 is a maximum of $1,000. My trading assets committed to margin requirements rarely exceed 15 percent. I don’t recall ever receiving a margin call for the account used to trade my full program. If I risk 1 percent of assets per trade and am wrong eight straight trades at least once each year, it means that I will experience a drawdown of at least 8 percent with certainty, at least on a closed trade basis. A 15 percent drawdown is about as much as I can emotionally handle. I have encountered a drawdown of at least 15 percent in 9 out of every 10 years I have operated a fully implemented trading program. I find myself more risk intolerant as I grow older. At the present time, my risk management protocol attempts to limit the maximum annual drawdown to 10 percent (measured from week-ending peak to week-ending valley). I attempt to ignore intraday equity spikes because I have no desire to catch the bottom of each day’s high or low, and I do not want to waste energy in even thinking about it. In fact, as I will discuss in this book, I think it is unwise to pay attention to account equity levels on a day-to-day basis. I consider correlation between markets when determining risk. For example, a bearish trend by the U.S. dollar against the euro is also likely to be accompanied by U.S. dollar losses against the Swiss franc and British pound. A bull market in soybeans is likely to be accompanied by advances in soybean oil or soybean meal. In composite positions of highly correlated markets (grains, interest rates, stock indexes, currencies, precious metals, industrial commodities), I attempt to limit my risk to 2 percent of assets. All successful trading operations must be built on a foundation of overall risk management. Diary of a Professional Commodity Trader

This is my way of analysing a chart...I need to find confirmed top/bottom and recent high/low..If you were to go long the recent high should be your target,,which is 250 pips from here. ,so the question is are you willing to have a stop of 100-150 pips for a gain of 250 pips.DD is relative imo..during my early days trading forex I had been watching this trader (not going to mention name) for nearly 2 years and he had stops of 200-250 pips but never let the trades go that far into dd but in the majority of trades taken he always came out winning,.EU,GU and GY were his "specialties"

Sure you can risk 100and200pips if you have confidence in what you are doing. Tight sl are killers of balance in your account just isn't easy to widen it up if you are not sure in yours judgment and analysis. I understand this from my own experience not for everybody big sl but is worth working on this.

why M5 is not suitable for inexperienced traders. If you have taken shorts where I marked you would have lost some money..if you were trading M15 there were no indication of shorts and checking H1 you will notice the trend is up

with naked charts as some traders claim they use where will be your entries and how accurate are you. I use naked charts when I do analysis on htf but I will find it impossible to scalp without indicators

Sometimes anticipating to much that pullback started on ht frame or change of direction, what is not so often.! By now I know best is to follow ht frame and to trade in same direction, but sometimes you get tempted just because pa looks just to good . Until price moves some distance 10pips or so and I'm able to put sl at break even then is ok, just this that you get hit often.! Part of the game, I guess this is better as to trade with no sl !

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Always take a look at H1 (the least you can do) and also H4..if you want agreement with H4 then you will enter later but I would say H1 should be ideal if you are trading M15 or below. You can also trade M15 alone like I shown below with bbma which gets you in with almost pin point accuracy and faster too..also use the cci 50 to guide you , only long when it's above 0..I gave you a winning method Don't forget to buy me lunch when you make money I just want to add gurus on the internet will teach you how to lose ,,,most of them use conventional techniques which any Tom, Dick and Harry know and follow and then fall into the majority of those who lose,,we want to do the opposite of what's taught by so called gurus

I was lucky to be triggered in last Friday... spreads were widening 15 minutes before the close and I tried my luck by putting in a pending sell at 1.2793 and it got hit and the price closed at 87 . It was a planned move on my part but I did not expect such a big gap down though I was very confident price will fall. There's nothing to worry when you have a plan set out. I am now planning to hold some trades for a far longer time as I take my direction from the monthly. Know what you are doing and you will never fear the market

EU, with your stupid indicators you would have lose money. Most important things in trading is keeping it simple but unfortunately most of us can't do it. If your method is good enough it will work both market conditions slow and trending. If you fuck your edge with stupid indicator like HA, TDI, Pivot, BB, too many MA your edge will come and go but you can't act on it because of inconsistent results. If those indicator is so good we have lot of good coder they have code it as ea and become very very successful. I assume your a manual trader and you want to be good at it. So take more responsibilities on your trading decision.

Here is only one trade I open in Friday. pips29 your the idiot, you can't adapt your self with market conditions change. You have a poor reading skills that is why you come to conclusions without understanding what I preach. I have told here when market is strongly trending EMA works well, when price is ranging S&amp; R works well. You don't get my point. your busy with your BBMA when market conditions is change. That is why you lost lot in this slow market, Last 2 week I gain 6%++, why! because I know what I am doing and I change with market conditions. I don't marry a system and force my phantasy to all market conditions. And most Importantly I know how to manage risk.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I don't neither short term. US30 is my main market,although looking for something else to adapt since I don't think trading only one symbol is good at the end. EU or GU looks good and fair, spreads are low and very volatile. Since I only scalp, it's main aspect for me

--- 帖子 #705 ---
If you like volatility you can trade us30 and gold. I follow a very good trader he trade gj and gold only and have manage very large account (own money)

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Gold is also really great, but I definetly have better results with the US30. Have to be a bit more conservative with the Gold, unusual movements occur there more often...

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Simple price behavior, some of the people need BBMA, TMS to trade this market, you can trade with any indicator. For trend directions you many check your EMA template for quick perspective.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Gold is very profitable too, but Gold give lots pain when it start moving slow. As trend trader it is little difficult too. Gold slowness stay much longer, like for weak and for a months . indicator based swing trading is some time difficult it is true. For doing Ping-Pong I like eu and GU. you can trade both side. some time get very slow but last weak and then start giving good return again. If anyone can manage himself for a weak He will recover his loss and gain more in next weak. Some people marry their system a lot don't understand trading system is beyond what indicator they put in. For example if I took 100$ risk in each trade when I win I win 200$, it could be a system. just need few more things to add and it become sustainable system. 40 to 65% win rate is very good.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
To trade trend continuations you don't need EMA and other indicators. I can trade with out indicator, Look at this chart how many good entry you can see. yes when we trade trend we may lose few trade, in fact it could be 50% or 60% no problem. since we win more than we lose in each trade. we are end of the day profitable.

Here is a thread to learn risk management, Hope it will help you. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...isk-management

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Here is a simple example of sell model than buy model and goes on. Once your buy model start you know your looking for buy, Now you go to H1 tf and Do just opposite of most of the traders, Buy at weakness in buy model, Sell at strength when your in Sell model. Now how you will enter it depend on your techniques, When your model is right and your risk for the model is fixed you can play the game with more confidence. If your RR is 1 to 2 or 1 to 3, you know you will make nice profit with 40% win rate. Your trading success depend on risk and self management, any one can have few good trade but not all become consistent profitable trader. Those who get too much excited with there wins they lose more with a short time. Welcome to the game called trading.

The EUR saw gains as its funding currency unwound with the JPY and the CHF on the risk off tones after the US thanksgiving. A funding currency is a cheap currency that you pair with high betas (like the NZD). So, the EUR gained on that. BUT the eurozone has surging cases. The services PMI have missed on greater COVID restrictions and this looks set to continue. The ECB meet in a few hours and they will almost certainly be dovish. More eur falls look highly likely. The NZD is expected to gain on the RBNZ projecting rate hikes to 2.6% by the end of 2023. With the major Omicron fears fading AND the Fed now not spooking markets the NZD can see some more gains as the risk on tones now support the NZD.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank cut stimulus further on Thursday but promised copious support for 2022, confirming its relaxed view on inflation and indicating that any exit from years of exceptionally easy policy will be slow. The bank said it would continue to cut bond buys under its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme next quarter and will wind down the scheme as expected next March. It will ramp up bond buys under its longer-running but more rigid Asset Purchase Programme, however, keeping the ECB active in the market. The central bank for the euro zone has said it considers a spike in inflation to be temporary. It will buy 40 billion euros of bonds under the APP in the second quarter, 30 billion euros in the third quarter, then from October onwards, purchases will be maintained at 20 billion euros, for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates. "The Governing Council judges that the progress on economic recovery and towards its medium-term inflation target permits a step-by-step reduction in the pace of its asset purchases over the coming quarters," it said. Although analysts expect the ECB to cut its bond purchases in half by April from now, the effective cut is likely to be much smaller as fresh government issuance is expected to fall, so the ECB will continue to hoover up most of the new debt. Attention now turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde's 1330 GMT news conference where she will unveil fresh economic forecasts.

The main focus of this lesson is to guide you through the process of designing your own forex trading system . While it doesn’t take long to come up with a system, it does take some time to extensively test it. So be patient; in the long run, a good forex trading system can potentially make you a lot of money. https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/juni...ing-system.png Step 1: Time Frame The first thing you need to decide when creating your system is what kind of forex trader you are . Are you a day trader or a swing trader ? Do you like looking at charts every day, every week, every month, or even every year? How long do you want to hold on to your positions? This will help determine which time frame you will use to trade. Even though you will still look at multiple time frames , this will be the main time frame you will use when looking for a trade signal. Step 2: Find indicators that help identify a new trend. Since one of our goals is to identify trends as early as possible, we should use i ndicators that can accomplish this. Moving averages are one of the most popular indicators that traders use to help them identify a trend. Specifically, they will use two moving averages (one slow and one fast) and wait until the fast one crosses over or under the slow one. This is the basis for what’s known as a “ moving average crossover ” system. https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/movi...er-example.png In its simplest form, moving average crossovers are the fastest ways to identify new trends. It is also the easiest way to spot a new trend. Of course, there are many other ways forex traders spot trends, but moving averages are one of the easiest to use. Step 3: Find indicators that help CONFIRM the trend. Our second goal for our system is to have the ability to avoid whipsaws, meaning that we don’t want to be caught in a “false” trend. The way we do this is by making sure that when we see a signal for a new trend, we can confirm it by using other indicators. There are many good technical indicators for confirming trends like MACD , Stochastic , and RSI . https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/char...ors-system.png As you become more familiar with various indicators, you will find ones that you prefer over others and can incorporate those into your system. Step 4: Define Your Risk When developing your forex trading system, it is very important that you define how much you are willing to lose on each trade . Not many people like to talk about losing, but in actuality, a good trader thinks about what he or she could potentially lose BEFORE thinking about how much he or she can win. The amount you are willing to lose will be different than everyone else. You have to decide how much room is enough to give your trade some breathing space, but at the same time, not risk too much on one trade. You’ll learn more about money management in a later lesson. Money management plays a big role in how much you should risk in a single trade. A trader should aways think about the potential loss BEFORE thinking about potential gain. Step 5: Define Entries &amp; Exits Once you define how much you are willing to lose on a trade, your next step is to find out where you will enter and exit a trade in order to get the most profit. Entries Some people like to enter as soon as all of their indicators match up and give a good signal, even if the candle hasn’t closed. Others like to wait until the close of the candle. Others like to wait until the close of the candle. One of the forex traders here in BabyPips.com, Pip Surfer, believes that it is best to wait until a candle closes before entering. He has been in many situations where he will be in the middle of a candle and all of the indicators match up, only to find that by the close of the candle, the trade has totally reversed on him! It’s all really just a matter of trading style. Some people are more aggressive than others and you will eventually find out what kind of trader you are. For example, in the chart below, this trader’s entry was when the candle closed below the support line. https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/system-entry.png Exits For exits, you have a few different options. One way is to trail your stop , meaning that if the price moves in your favor by ‘X’ amount, you move your stop by ‘X’ amount. Another way to exit is to have a set target, and exit when the price hits that target . How you calculate your target is up to you. For example, some traders choose support and resistance levels as their targets. In the chart below, the exit is set at a specific price which is near the bottom of the descending channel. https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/system-exit.png Others just choose to go for the same amount of pips ( fixed risk ) on every trade. However you decide to calculate your target, just make sure you stick with it. Never exit early no matter what happens. Stick to your trading system! After all, YOU developed it! One more way you can exit is to have a set of criteria that, when met, would signal you to exit. For example, you could make it a rule that if your indicators happen to reverse to a certain level, you would then exit out of the trade. Step 6: Write down your system rules and FOLLOW IT! https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/writ...stem-rules.png This is the most important step in creating your trading system. You MUST write your trading system rules down and ALWAYS follow them. Discipline is one of the most important characteristics a trader must have, so you must always remember to stick to your system! No system will ever work for you if you don’t stick to the rules, so remember to be disciplined. Oh yeah, did we mention you should ALWAYS stick to your rules? How to Test Your Forex Trading System https://bpcdn.co/images/2010/09/init...ting-tubes.png The fastest way to test your system is to find a charting software package where you can go back in time and move the chart forward one candle at a time. When you move your chart forward one candle at a time, you can follow your trading system rules and take your trades accordingly. Record your trading record, and BE HONEST with yourself! Record your wins, losses, average win, and average loss. If you are happy with your results then you can go on to the next stage of testing: trading live on a demo account. Trade your new system live on a demo account for at least two months. This will give you a feel for how you can trade your system when the market is moving. Trust us, it is very different trading live than when you’re backtesting. After two months of trading live on a demo account, you will see if your system can truly stand its ground in the market. If you are still getting good results, then you can choose to trade your system live on a REAL account. At this point, you should feel very confident with your forex trading system and feel comfortable taking trades with no hesitation.

Are you still on track to meet your trading goals? Are your trading systems living up to their back and forward testing potential? If you feel frustrated over your performance, don’t worry. It may be that you’re forgetting a few basic truths about trading. Let’s take a reality check on some truths that not a lot of traders will tell you but will help your trading journey: 1. It takes money to make money. While a lot of traders have been successful starting small, they’ve also had to deal with pitfalls involved with trading small accounts. Trading with oversized and overleveraged positions, for example, presents greater risks of a margin call. Being more invested in the P/L of each of your trades can also drive you to make more trading psychology mistakes than if you had a larger account you could afford to lose. Don’t get me wrong, you certainly CAN start trading with only a small amount of money. And bad traders can blow a large account as fast as they can a small account. But trading is not a hobby. It’s a business. And like most businesses, it takes capital to earn a substantial amount of profits. Don’t expect to earn hundreds of dollars per week with your $50 account. 2. You have to be where the action is. One of the more common trading advice is to maximize opportunities during the time of the day when you’re most available to trade. This strategy is fine. If you’re a newbie who’s looking to get your feet wet. If you’re serious about developing your trading skills and confidence, you have to trade when the market is giving you the most opportunity. For most traders, this usually means trading the London and New York sessions. Just like how a doctor would see a wider range of illnesses in a tropical third-world country than in a first world suburb, traders who trade the more active trading sessions will likely sharpen their skills faster than if they trade the quieter sessions. 3. You’re going to be wrong. A lot. And because no single system can stay profitable through ALL trading conditions, even your tried-and-tested mechanical systems will be wrong a lot. So, how do you stay profitable even when you’re wrong? Remember that a trader doesn’t have to have a high win rate to be profitable. Some traders can be profitable with low win rates if their average win is high enough. Instead of focusing on winning, focus on learning the art of “feeling” the market. A trader who can quickly identify changing market conditions and who can manage his/her risk exposure while doing so is a trader who can stay consistently profitable. 4. There’s no holy grail in trading. In case you missed the 57,219 memos we’ve shared, let me repeat it for you: There’s no “holy grail,” or one indicator, method, strategy, or system that would yield you forex trading profits 100% of the time. Now write it down or write it on a T-shirt! Just because there’s no holy grail doesn’t mean you can’t be profitable. Many traders are already trading full-time and even more are content to be consistently profitable. The key is to control your risk. Since you can’t eliminate it, the least you can do is to control it with proper risk management. 5. Trading is NOT for everyone. There are many reasons why 95% of new traders eventually fail. For one thing, it takes TIME, EFFORT, and a lot of PATIENCE to become consistently profitable. Those who can’t or aren’t willing to provide all three will likely find themselves among the 95% before the year is out. It’s also possible that a person is just not cut out for trading. This doesn’t count against the person or the industry. You wouldn’t force someone into the military or play the piano if they’re not interested or cut out for them, would you? That said, you won’t know if trading is for you until you’ve tried long enough and made enough effort to try to become consistently profitable.

"" 5 to 7 percent a month is EVERYONES dream. Heck 2 or 3 percent if handled correctly can change your life very quickly. if it can be sustained then "those dreams" that get us into this business are very much possible. One of the things im most proud of is the number of people that reach this point but i have to say the following and its for you to think about and anyone else that reads this. Most people overtrade and that usually includes those of you that are doing this well or even better. The inevitable tough month or two comes along and destroys the gains and more importantly the confidence and its almost always due to overtrading both as a cause to begin with and as a "remedie" in trying to recover. read that over and over and over. that comes from personal experience. the way to keep this evil out of your trading is simply to refine refine refine until your trades are virtual "locks" as far as being at the worst breakeven. THIS "ABILITY" IS EARNED AND NOT GIVEN and can often be a multi year journey. ""

Here is a swing line indicator you can use, It is much better than TDI, and MA HMA cross. Again it gives lots of signal to enter and exit. You have to filter out few good trade. If you create EA with Swing line indicator it will not work well but In manual trading it will give nice visual guide about the market. 30 LWMA and 10 EMA could works as a filter. General Entry rules 1. 10 ema cross 30 Lwma up, swingline change opposite side, when swing line change color buy side you will enter. 2. Stop loss- use ATR for stop or place stop below 30 Lwma or wait for stop and tp hit. 3. Exit target 1 to 2 or 3 RR. or when swing line change color close the trade. or when price started to respect a level with multiple candle market slow down happen you can exit with 1 to 1 rr profit. When system will work well 1. when market is clean and swing exist in the market, I mean smooth market. when system will not work well 1. when price is very choppy and random Possible solutions- Use Trend line, Channel to understand market conditions. May use one TF higher to have broader outlook. When market is over extended don't open trade with the directions of the trade, you may hold your partial trade. To understand over extended market you can use D.w.M. Average range. I have share that indicator here before. You will lose money with all system Because 1. you over trade 2. you risk too much 3. after few losing trade you open big lot trade. Summary - you will lose money trading because of bad risk management and Bad trade management, Over trading happen because of small stop loss and Take profit target. Develop a rules for preventing over trading, like if I stop out in this area I will wait 10 candle before opening next trade. if I stop out this week 2 trade I will not trade this week, ETC. Strict to one TF and One Pair will help you to be more focus, Chose trending pair like GJ. write down when you will not trade, write down when you lose 2 trade 3 trade 5 trade consistently what will you do and what will you don't do. From your past experience you already know what should you do. Trade one style. The style we follow here is Trend continuations and swing Trading. Not level trading, Not Mean reversion trading, Not pull back entry Post your chart here as a practice, more practice you will do more better you will get. For Better understanding, Just open 10 Trade by following the rules in one pair, If you win 5 trade out of 10 Trade you have great chance to do well with this system. keep following the system you will get better at it.

Here is 4 possible entry. all give more than 1 to 2 RR. Remember 10 Trade is your cycle. Try to win more trade in your 10 Trade cycle. After the cycle is over evaluate your self, Are you following your rules in this 10 Trade cycle. If you find yourself you are not following your rules stop live trading start demo trading and build confidence. You have to follow your rules no matter win or loss. That is how you can reduce emotions.
