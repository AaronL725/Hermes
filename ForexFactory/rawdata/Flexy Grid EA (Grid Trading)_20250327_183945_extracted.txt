This thread will be about my EA Flexy Grid.

It's called Flexy because I want it to be Flexible, I can place the buy/sell grid manually or automatically.
Personally I use it manually because I like to have control. I'm smarter than this EA, the EA doesn't take account of other variable i.e. News and what I'm seeing over my eyes and head.

Manual Flexy Grid

Automatic Flexy Grid. When you click the Manual button and it becomes Automatic button in green color, you should see a screenshot like that below. In order to start the EA to trade automatically, you have to click the "START" button. It will become green when you click it. Basically the start button is a safety trigger.

The green window on the top right corner contains information regarding the equity, signal etc. I think it's self explanatory, if you don't understand you can ask me.

Anyhow below are the 3 information that might need some explanation while the rest info are self explanatory.
Trading With Line is for Manual trading, it will execute a trade whenever the price crosses the Horizontal line object. In order to place a trade using this method, you have to edit the object name by adding _B or _S.

_B is for buy grid, _S is for sell grid.

Example Buy Grid

Horizontal Line 3951_B

Sell Grid

Horizontal Line 3951_S

Grid Space is the distance between each order. By default it is set to 5 pips space.

Grid is the number of order in a grid. It is depend on the ability the broker's MT4 able to place order. Some broker is able to place 100 orders, some 20, some 50 etc. You can find out by testing it on a demo account or ask their support about the maximum order their MT4 can take.

Example:

If the broker allows you to place 100 Orders, then you should set the grid value to 49 or 50 grid. It will place 49 or 50 trade of Sell/Buy stop and Buy/Sell limit, total 100 order.

I highly suggest you to try this on a demo first. Play around with it first and please give me some of your feedback. I appreciate it.

Trading With Line is for Manual trading, it will execute a trade whenever the price crosses the Horizontal line object. In order to place a trade using this method, you have to edit the object name by adding _B or _S. In order to enable this feature, you have to make sure the "Use Lines" button is green, you can click it to switch back and forth (Red/green)

_B is for buy grid, _S is for sell grid.

Example Buy Grid

Horizontal Line 3951_B

Sell Grid

Horizontal Line 3951_S

Example of Buy Grid concept. Applicable to the Sell Grid just the opposite.

In this case the losing position is the "SELL" trade which got hedged with multiple buy orders

Thank you so much for sharing your work

Grid trading is a very popular trading style. Lotta people had big time trading on that.

Now, please explain every feature in order to figure it out the logic and to make it easy for everyone to pick its own style

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks for the reply mate. I appreciate it!

GridTradeManually - If it sets to true, means that you will trade manually. It can be override when you click the AUTOMATIC button in the chart.

StartAutomaticTrading - is the safety trigger. When you set gridTradeManually to false and startAutomaticTrading to true, it will trade automatically when you click the Ok button.

ExecuteTradeUsingTrendOrHorizontalLine - It will execute a trade when using the price crosses the Horizontal line. It is use when you trade manually.

backTestMode - is set to true when you want to backtest the automation feature of the EA.

Lots - Is the number of lot per position/order

GridSpace - The grid pips space between each order

maxGrid - Number of stop/limit order. If you set to 20, that mean you will have 20 stop orders and 20 limit orders

TakeProfit - Grid will be close when the profit reaches the take profit amount in term of currency

TradePerDay - This is for automatic grid trading feature. If it set to >1, then per day it will trade as much >1 closed grid. If it set to 0, it will open a grid trade unlimited per day.

startHour - For automatic, at what time do you want the EA to start trigger the trade

endHour - For automatic, at what time do you want the EA to end the grid trading.

stopTradingAfter - For automatic, it will stop trading after it opens several grid trading.

Let say you set it to 5. It will stop trading after the EA closes the 5th grid regardless how many days it takes per grid.

TakeProfit - Grid will be close when the profit reaches the take profit amount in term of currency

That's what I'm talking about  (you can update it in time making it more clearer and effective)

Now it's more easy, simple, clear.

Great job yousername, thx!

Grid trading can be very successful, people! (of course, you must know what you're doing, not trading blindly)

Enjoy everybody, good trading!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks mate for the question.

I was too lazy to explain it by my self until some one like you show up show some interest and ask question. Then I'll be happy to explain things and fix things if there's issue. I wish you the best with your trade and let me know if you find anything with this EA.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
It seems to be working only with 0.01 lots. Changing Lots to for example 0.1 returns an order send error.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
With your manual trading experience can you suggest a good values for GridSpace, maxGrid for EURO USD please, back testing shows good results

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks for the question and using the EA!

Personally I like to use as maximum maxGrid as I can and as tight GridSpace as the broker can.

So it depends on the broker.

If the broker allows you to place 1000 orders, then i'd love to place total of 1000 orders in a grid.

It is best to use this EA on a single pair. Try not to use it on multiple pair because there could be issue with order placement. For instance when the order has been used on one pair. And the other pair wanted to place a grid order, it will have difficulty because there's no space left to place an order. I hope you can understand what I mean.

For the gridSpace, I usually set to 5 pips.

If I set lower than that, usually there's order issue in the center of the grid because the first stop/limit order is too close to the current price. You can try see it for your self on your demo account and set the EA to manual trading. You will see a missing limit/stop order when you set the gridSpace too low/small.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Warning: There's no stop loss in this Grid Trading. However you can close the grid by clicking the "Close grid" button when you set the trading mode to Manual trading.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Warning num.2 - when you click Close grid button, EA close ALL OPENED ORDERS IN MT - not only orders opened via this EA - there is error with magic Nr?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks Lopuch for that. When I test this, I didn't put another pair order into the test.

I'll fix it ASAP

--- 帖子 #16 ---
That was embarassing. I missed the magic number check.

OrderSelect(x, SELECT_BY_POS);

if(OrderSymbol()==Symbol() && OrderType()==OP_BUY && closeBuy &&OrderMagicNumber()==MagicNumber)

OrderClose( OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(), MODE_ASK), Slippage, Red );

else if(OrderSymbol()==Symbol() && OrderType()==OP_SELL && closeSell &&OrderMagicNumber()==MagicNumber)

OrderClose( OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(), MODE_BID), Slippage, Red );

I'm testing it on my end.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thank you for letting me know the issue.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

New EA fix

Attachment 4

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Warning 3: When you change time frame, it deletes all objects that isn't related to Flexy Grid

A new version will come soon. But I don't think this is urgent. So I'm gonna finish this tomorrow

--- 帖子 #19 ---
If you ask me, why don't I set stop loss or margin stop on this EA is because I never use stop loss and I know when to quit the market.

But if you want to have such feature, please let me know how you want to end the grid when you're in a winning and losing position. Then I will decide which idea is possible to be implemented or can be implemented in few hours.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi yousername, Many thanks for making your EA available. Would it be possible for you to make it trade any lot size. I would prefer trading at 0.1 lots. I am fully aware of the risks of Grid Traders but I believe with sufficient capital 0.1 lots can be traded successfully. Thank you and Best rgds

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks for that!

Somehow the EA can trade with 0.01 and >1 lot.

But can't trade with 0.1.

The issue was with the Lot checking. After I remove the lotsize check, problem solved.

Now the problem solved with version 1.2.

Now you should be able to trade with any lot size.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Guys I'm sorry if the code is not perfect yet although I use it on the demo account. I like to perfected the EA on the fly meaning from your input or bug finding.

Why? Because I'm busy with many other things i.e. changing my baby diaper and I can make some time to fix the issue that you find.

I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi yousername, That was fast!! Many thanks to you, it is greatly appreciated...Best rgds

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Just a small technical note : When you close a buy trade use Bid price not Ask, and vice versa for a sell trade.

Good Luck

Thanks for the feedback mate.

Yes you're right. I cross checked all my close order method, and now only one method that got wrong closeTrades(). :Facepalm:

I'm fairly new to installing EA's...I'm getting a #4109 error when I attempt to place a grid on the chart.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Can you tell me how did you get that error message so I can replicate it on my end and resolve it?

Thanks!

Hey make sure Allow Trading is green.

WHen it's green, remove the EA and re-attach it.

Then you can place your grid

Hi yousername,

What does the EA use to establish bullish /bearish/neutral? Can the line option be used in a visual backtest?

Thanks

maahome

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thanks for the questions mate. I appreciate for your interest.

The signal is based on 3 Indis such as Aligator with 2 EMA(5,10) crossing, Zigzag and RSI.

If each indi is bullish or bearish or non at all it will produce either 1 or -1 or 0

I summed all the result hence something like below

if it >0 then it's bullsiih (1,1,1 = 3)

<0 then it's bearish (-1,-1,-1 = -3)

==0 then it's neutral (1,0,-1 = 0)

It's simple, nothing fancy but it works ok.

Regarding trading using the line option in the backtest, I have not tried that yet.

But if it doesn't work, you can forward test it on a demo account.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Many thanks for the quick response. I like the way it does things. A couple of thoughts - Have you considered a dynamic grid (say one that expands during very long extended moves)?

As far as I can see their is only the one hedge trade right at the start and if you have the grid set to say 20 trades it will open 1 sell and 19 buys in a bullish cycle (that was how it backtested anyway) - is that what you wanted?

I am also assuming that on automatic that it can only open a buy grid on bullish and a sell grid on bearish - what is the rule with neutral? canm it open either? none?

Again - thanks for the opportunity to try it and play around.

cheers

Yes when you set maxgrid to 10, it will open 10 order for each limit and stop orders, total = 20 and 1 opposite trade. Yes that's what I wanted, 1 losing trade covered with a whole lot of winning trading position.

In order to win with this EA, first you have to identify a trend continuation. Usually in a trend continuation you are in a range market in a short period of time. Let say you're in a bullish trend continuation and place the buy grid manually. Over that range market, it will trigger several buy limit orders and when it's going up, the losing position (sell) will be covered and triggered the buy stop order, hence you got 1 losing position + many many wining opened buy positions. So yes, they key success is identifying a trend continuation (range market that is not a reversal but instead a trend continuation). You can also win with this EA in a range market as well and breakout.

If it neutral, it won't place a grid, none.

Dynamic grid? My thought is, it's not a good idea because grid trading is meant to be fixed and better yet it's simpler. But do you have any reference for me to dive deeper on that subject, so maybe it could change my mind.

I guess a version of this EA that didn't hedge would go against the basic strategy?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
In the EA properties or setting, you have to set the value of "How many stop/limit orders per grid" bigger than 0.

If you set to 0 then you will only open an opposite position trade without any stop/limit order thus no hedge. From the screenshot I shared, I accidentally set the value to 0 and maybe that caused the confusion.

So here's a better screenshot. Please note that this is just for an example sake

Thank you so much.  Before I read your request, you figured it out.  Nice skills there Yousername...an MT4 programmer who also can see the future!  lol.  This is coming along nicely. Liked your post on its use and purpose...trend continuation, ranging markets, etc.  I am trying to fit it into a system where I know where I believe the market is going and want to put X number of trades in on its way there, as well as 3-5 in the opposite direction to give it some room to go in the opposite direction first.  So, for a Bearish trade, for example, maybe a few SELL LIMITS up to 500 PIPS the wrong way SELLing me into a position, and a STOP LIMIT, which will indicate I the market went entirely the other way, as well as X number of SELL stops then on the way down to the target.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G Illustration!

Thank you for spending your time drawing the grid.

I appreciate it.

I prefer the 2nd and 3rd Illustration. I like the dipped before going higher. Usually that happens when you are in a trend continuation where over that short period of time, the market is in a range market.

The first Illustration is when the market is in a high volatility to one direction, in this case up. Usually this happens during the breakout of a ranging market.

I thought it can be helpful in case you consider some day a new logic to recode smth for an improved version

I guess it can be interesting not only because it's a much better approach of the classical RR 1:1 trading,

but also because is introducing ...a limit. A StopLoss.
And that's because I think is very dangerous to keep that pyramidal positional structure to no end.
The losses might adding up exponentially if the market goes against you.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hey mate thanks for the comment, I appreciate it.

Sorry I don't understand your comment fully. But please correct me if i'm wrong. From the screenshot did you mean you want to put a stop loss, in your screenshot the stop loss is STOP Limit. Meaning when the market cross the STOP Limit, it will close the order?

In addition to that, you want to have the TAKE PROFIT feature when it crosses the green line as seen in your screenshot?

Thanks

Regards

Yousername

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hey, what you have done is awesome.  I have been looking for an EA that will do that...put a STOP loss at a point in the other direction that gives the trade some space, if it needs it, but pulls the trigger (and closes all trades) to get me out if it goes too far.  And, that EA will also have a Take Profit point where it will close the trades out once it hits it.  And, I did write STOP limit, but meant STOP loss, where it closes out the trades (and says, "Try again another day Dude, cuz I ain't going down anytime soon!"

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Did you mean that it's a good idea to have a STOP LOSS based on pips?

Meaning if the total pips in the grid is -50, then close it with loss

if the total pips is +50 pips, then take profit?

Is that right?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
HI. Interesting EA. Will test it!

About he start and end trading hour:  thats the broker hour, GMT hour or local PC hour? THanks!

It is based on the time in the MT4. So that should be based on the server hour?

TudorIoan...I am not sure I can see how this can be done?  As I see it, once you take trade 1, you can't move the entry point to #2.  And, if you take 3 trades at the lines indicated, I think we may have the following:

We're in a 1:1 Risk to Reward trade, where we seek 50 PIPS (in this instance).  In Example 1 (left), the trade is taken (#1), then price goes up, takes a second BUY, then a third BUY, and closes at +50PIPS.

Example 2 (middle), the trade is taken (#1), then price goes down and takes a second BUY (#2), then goes up and makes a third BUY, goes up further and gives +50PIPS total.  {Probably worth saying that each horizontal line is approx 17 PIPS}.  So, Trade #1 nets 34 PIPS.  It loses 17, then goes back up 51PIPS to net 34.  Trade #2 starts lower, and goes up netting +51 PIPS. Trade #3 goes up 17PIPS, netting 17PIPS.  So, total net PIPS for the trades would be:  34+51+17=102 PIPS.

Example 3 (right), the trade is taken (#1), price drops to the first line where Trade #2 (BUY) is taken.  Price drops further to the second line down where Trade #3 occurs, also a BUY.  Then, price goes up to the first line above the initial entry point and closes there.  My summation of the win is:  Trade #1 is up 17PIPS (based on the assumption in 2 above. Trade 2 drops 17 PIPS before rallying and capturing 34PIPS net.  Trade #3 (BUY), falls a slight bit, rises to the first line above the initial entry, and nets 51PIPS. Total PIPS for these 3 trades = 17+34+51=102 PIPS.

That's how I would understand the diagram.  And, this is what I was thinking, as I drew up my chart.

Thanks folks...good stuff...love the thinking process.

TudorIoan PM me and those grids are separate example. So yes you're right.

OMG, Daccer, thank you so much for your effort to translate that crazy scheme of mine

...I am so sorry because I am not able to explain it better...

But there are 3 different situations there and in all of them is about RR 1:1, like+50 pips and -50pips as a pontential outcome

It's only the entry keeps shifting and the target zone is keep shifting

...so sorry, dont know to explain bettter

TudorIoan/Yousername, If each number in each example were a trade, the trader would multiply his/her PIPS and income from a straight BUY to the Take Profit point.  That's the value I see in Grid Trading.  If you pick the right direction, but the trade goes against you for a (manageable) while, you will earn more than if it just went directly to your target (Take Profit) point. And, you can use smaller lot sizes because you buy/sell in at multiple levels.

Good luck!

Derek

TudorIoan thanks for your time providing great examples.

It seems from your bullish example, the center of the grid is a buy trade. I don't see a hedge positioned. It's all in one direction.

Am I right?

Enjoy your ice cream!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yep, no hedge, it's only the long approach. The short one is symmetrically opposite, as you expected.

And everything can be expanded on much more levels...

Ok, thank you, out now

--- 帖子 #61 ---
very good MM concept.

would make a great EA for any system

New update Version 1.5

Trading Info Top Right CornerNow has PIPS information for Buy, Sell and Profit Total Profit changed to "Profit" Added Account Currency. As seen in the screenshot below it's GBP  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So here is the main update "R:R money management"

New input in the EA Property.

Pretty much self explanatory and descriptive.

Hi yousername!

Great project, thanks lot for sharing. Not sure if fixed at version 1.5 but my testing of version 1.2 showed a bug u might like to check.

My grid got closed at tp but just a single trade wasnt closed. Please see attachments. No errors at the experts log..

Thanks!

DT

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks for informing me about it.

I will check it asap.

Probably i will double check when closing the grid to make sure all orders in the grid are closed.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks for taking care!

One more suggestion to improve the EA: What do u think about a "stealth mode"?

This way u could bypass most brokers limitation of X pending orders plus your broker wont see that you'r about to trade a bigger grid.

What do you think?

For visual support, the EA might just place some horizontal lines instead of pending orders.

DT

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Nice EA. There is an error #129 showing not sure what it is also for tp & SL setting it does not seem to appear on charts. (thanks for sharing)

--- 帖子 #67 ---
This is tricky and full of negative assumption about the broker . I my self will start a brokerage business with my colleague. lol

Stealth mode to me is a good way to place a mega grid. 1000 orders.

But for getting away from volatility in the market especially in a high impact news, maybe not.

Several problem with that

1. we could have a duplicated order.

2. The grid space between some order could be offset by 1 or 3 pips or more

3. Unknown.

Issue 1 and 2 could happened because of high volatility.

For instance let say the stealth order started at 1.3333 and the grid space is 5 pips.

Then a sudden volatility makes the price went up 50 pips in a second.

All of your new order could be executed between 1.3350 to 1.3383. Because of that the grid is not evenly spread orders and causing imbalance in the grid.

Whereas using a built in order, the market will place the order exactly at the requested price so we can have a evenly spread orders.

Anyhow I will see what I can do. Finger crossed.

I appreciate your feedback!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks for the bug!

What instrument did you trade with?

How did you get the error? I want to replicate it on my end.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
TP and SL (Presuming you mean the R:R ratio), yes it's not visible.

If you set it to true, It is processed in the background.

I think I will place info about in in the info window

I think it could be because either your VPS too fast or too slow?

Probably too fast, faster than the MT4 server... lol

Ok try this one out and see if the problem has gone completely?

Would you mind sharing the detailed settings for Aligator, the 2 EMA's (any Shift, applyed to close, open, high...), zigzag and RSI (if levels used, please let me know) so i can create a visual template. Would be helpful to keep an eye on the trigger and paying attention to potential entry bugs. Thanks mucho, yousername!

alligator setting
Inserted Code       jaw_val=iAlligator(Symbol(),tradingTF,13,8,8,5,5,3,MODE_SMMA,PRICE_MEDIAN,MODE_GATORJAW,pos-8);
teeth_val=iAlligator(Symbol(),tradingTF,13,8,8,5,5,3,MODE_SMMA,PRICE_MEDIAN,MODE_GATORTEETH,pos-5);
lips_val=iAlligator(Symbol(),tradingTF,13,8,8,5,5,3,MODE_SMMA,PRICE_MEDIAN,MODE_GATORLIPS,pos-3);

MA setting
Inserted Code       fasterEMAnow = iMA(Symbol(),tradingTF, FasterEMA, 0, MODE_EMA, PRICE_CLOSE, pos);
slowerEMAnow = iMA(Symbol(),tradingTF, SlowerEMA, 0, MODE_EMA, PRICE_CLOSE, pos);

ZigZag
Inserted Code iCustom(Symbol(), tradingTF, "ZigZag", zperiod,5,3,0, i);

RSI
Inserted Code iRSI(Symbol(),tradingTF,14,PRICE_CLOSE,0);

TF is set to DAILY (fixed).

Sorry if I send you a code instead each individual indi' setting. It's easier sending the code.

Basically

Alligator - default

ZigZag, 5,5,3

RSI, 14

2 EMA (5 and 10) no shift

--- 帖子 #76 ---
No worrys yousername, whatever you feel more comfortable with is fine.

Just to make sure i got the rules correct;

LONG confirmation:

Aligator*: Lips (green) > Teeth (red) > Jaws (blue)

EMA: Fast MA crossed slow MA

ZigZag: Current price is higher than last zigzag-drawn peak

RSI: Rising and (at least) touching or crossing the level 70

*Colours by default

One more question: A few posts above you said actually 3 indicators need to aggree to either trigger (sum +3 or -3) or sum needs to be 0 to be neutral.

Counting 4 indicators here. Which one wont get included into the calculation?

Thanks much (and please dont mind all my anoying questions ;-))

DT

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I combined Ali and EMAs into 1 method. That's why we have 3 instead 4, just to keep it simple.

Maybe you can understand this

Inserted Code       if ((fasterEMAnow > slowerEMAnow)
&& jaw_val<teeth_val && teeth_val<lips_val) {
return 1;
}
else if ((fasterEMAnow < slowerEMAnow)
&& jaw_val>teeth_val && teeth_val>lips_val){
return -1;
}
return 0;

RSI method
Inserted Code    double rsi = iRSI(Symbol(),tradingTF,14,PRICE_CLOSE,0);
if(rsi>65)//oversold
return -1;
else if(rsi<35)//overbought
return 1;
else if(rsi>50)//bullish
return 1;
else if(rsi<50)//bearish
return -1;
return  0;

ZigZag methods
Inserted Code int getZigZagPosition(int index){
int i = 0;
int zigzag = 0;
int zigzagIndex=0;
while(i<Bars && zigzagIndex<index)
{
double zz1=iCustom(Symbol(), tradingTF, "ZigZag", zperiod,5,3,0, i);
if (zz1>0) {
zigzagIndex++;
}
i++;
}
return i-1;
}
int zigzag(){
int i = getZigZagPosition(zindex);
double z = iCustom(Symbol(), tradingTF, "ZigZag", zperiod,5,3,0, i);
double close = iClose(Symbol(),tradingTF,0);
if(z>close)
return -1;
else if(z<close)
return 1;

return 0;
}
Correction zperiod is set to 5,

Therefore zz indi set is 5,5,3

2. You want those green dots to be removed? If yes, no sorry better it stay there. If you don't like it, you can delete it from the object list by your self.

3. Where's your buy order? Why it's gone? Did you intentionally remove it?

I enable manual sell grid and that’s what came out lol (sell limit and sell stop) 10 grid (10 up & 10 down)

For email means to update cycle once profit taken by email

As for the green dots (noted tq)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yes 10 for each sell stop & limit order.

However at the center of it, there should be an opposite order "Buy order".

But from the screenshot, it's not there. I wonder what happened. Was there an error when you placed the sell grid?

yousername solved it very easy  the concept is actually working now on the latest version  (even the creator is not aware of it yet )

i think this one will become a hell of EA (was looking for smth like that time ago)...once bugs out and many improvements and suggestions from interested people here

--- 帖子 #90 ---
maybe error #129 can be solved by adding slipage ? i am not sure lol.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I haven't tested hard yet, but don't you think that Grid profit target has to be sharply correlated with Lots per order and Reward (pips) ?

...because if you set the lot size and set reward in pips that must lead to a certain amount in dollars, ...not a random set.

So, I guess they shouldn't be allowed to be set uncorrelated... could lead to some error, imo

...just asking... bugging around

When trying the EA on XAUUSD and USDMXN, works on the first, places orders. Then when starting on the 2nd chart I get the message: there are opened orders (and nothing happens). The only opened order was the Gold one. So I closed that grid (& trade) and start automatic on the Peso: nothing happens. Starting manual places the initial trade followed by pendings.

You're welcome, my pleasure!

You can use this EA on mutiple chart.

When the EA opened a grid on one chart, it won't open another grid on another chart.

WHY?

Because the limit/stop orders could already be used 100% on the first chart.

So on the second chart, there's no limit/stop order left for it. In short, no more bullet rounds until the grid on another chart is closed.

HEre is an example

You have EURUSD and USDCHF

You opened a grid on USDCHF and used all the available stop/limit orders on the MT4 platform for USDCHF. Let say the maximum order is 50.

As you have used all 50 orders for USDCHF, EURUSD will not be able open a grid until USDCHF Grid is closed

Furthermore I think there's no way to find out the maximum number of orders a broker can handle with MQL4. If it's possible, then we could have some order management. Unfortunately it's not possible for now. Let see if it will in the MT5

For reference read below
https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/155714#comment_3800403

A user said "Broker dependent, some 100, some 1000, some don't care. Ask the broker, put it in an external."

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I gotta take my word back...

I forgot that you can know the allowed limit orders

using

(int)AccountInfoInteger(ACCOUNT_LIMIT_ORDERS);
https://docs.mql4.com/constants/envi...t_info_integer

Inserted Code bool IsNewOrderAllowed()
{
//--- get the number of pending orders allowed on the account
int max_allowed_orders=(int)AccountInfoInteger(ACCOUNT_LIMIT_ORDERS);
//--- if there is no limitation, return true; you can send an order
if(max_allowed_orders==0) return(true);
//--- if we passed to this line, then there is a limitation; find out how many orders are already placed
int orders=OrdersTotal();
//--- return the result of comparing
return((orders+(maxGrid*2)+1)<max_allowed_orders);
}
Need to assess the possibility.

Unlimited grid orders. For your reference attached file

This EA Opens a grid of Buy Stops and Sell Stops at a specified distance from price. It is not a fully automatic EA. You need to reset it once a while.
FeaturesStartinglot IncreasePercentage - Choose to have Increasing grid lots Distance from price - Points from price where grid starts Spacebetween Trades - Points between orders Number of trades - Total of open and pending orders in your terminal Takeprofit - TP in points Stoploss - SL in points Trailingstop - TS in points Magic Can be used on all pairs and timeframes. Feel free to play around with it, but remember this is not at fully operational EA that can run on its own.

New UPdate 1.6

Recent issue with the grid closing it self is because there was an issue with the Risk:Reward function that caused the grid to close.

I have not test the latest fix fully. I need your help to exploit it until it break.

Existing issues

1. There's issue with the Trading Grid style button (the 101,111 buttons), It keep reverting back to "101" when changing TF

2. When there's error during placing the order, it will retry to place the order.

However, sometime the retry may be unsuccessful and lead to freeze because the EA keeps retrying placing an order but somehow it's unsuccessful hence an stucked in an infinite loop or crash. You gotta close the chart and reopen it to reset back to normal. In the next build, I will place a retry counter, it will stop retry after several try.

New Feature:

Are those recent requested feature except for STEALTH MODE and EMAIL.

Please exploit it, bug hunting.

Meanwhile i'm gonna go out shopping with family.

All perfect the manual trading is great (however the auto need to attached close grid and TF switch error) auto will be very useful once ok as future to identify entry e.g. key Supply & demand area / channel extreme with certain rule will be a great attack EA with calculated risk e.g. grid 3 attack and so forth.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I used 3 pips grid space and 3 orders per grid edit: and TP+18pips SL -18 pips (so, RR1:1) to check faster the session's outcome.

So I've already went through a few TP/SL sessions. Yellen's blabbering helped a lot for consistent movement

It's a good tool. Since you have introduced the TP/SL the EA suited my weird concept, yes, the one i tried to explain here.

I am happy

Thanks (ok, no irony now)

--- 帖子 #132 ---
wow 3 pips grid space? On what broker?

"MetaQuotes" brk  ...it's only on demo, no brk.!

2) Critical need user recovery

--- 帖子 #150 ---
1. I was thinking the order of closing the pending and active orders.

First delete the active order.

Then for the pending order, it should delete from the center rather the top and bottom.

Because if it deletes the pending order from the top and the bottom, there's a chance the market could executes/touches the pending order in the center.

2. Having some issue when I use a grid that has 100 pending limit & stop orders in multiple chart.

Somehow there's a limit a broker can cater those orders. So there should be a way to check if there's any room (available order) left before placing a grid.

Recently I planned to opened 200 orders on 5 or 6 markets so total should be >1000 orders.

But then there's issue, it got stucked in a loop for retrying placing an order.

Because of that each market has uneven/imbalance grid. So yeah, that's a broker's problem that needs to be identify so we won't have a bad grid.

I just red your message . Thank you for using the EA and be honest about it.

To everyone keep the idea coming and we shall implement the best idea out there.

Do not be afraid every one because in the end, the EA is free!!!

Why I do this? I have too much money and too much spare time

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Damn, new versions coming quick like a shot! Thanks much for your effort, yousername!

Just in case you're looking for more ideas:

Auto-Breakeven

Trading grid is always related to bigger drawdowns, mainly because of economic events. Thing is, most of these impacts are announced even before they come. There are dozens of economic calenders out there, as you know. IMHO, high impact events are death to any grid strategy. But here's the point: We will never be able to only trade when no high impacts are around (or upcoming). Some grids take more time so the most logical consequence is to be prepared.

Lets say i'm trading a bullish grid of USDCAD. Next high impact event is US Unemployment Claims with a obvious negative forecast (compared with previous), happening in 10 hours. In my manual trading, id make sure - about 4 hours before impact come -  to get a breakeven with my grid. 1 hour before the impact comes (and breakeven wasnt reached), i embrace the possibility of losing and decide if close the grid completely.

Saying that to the background; is there any way you might add a "Breakeven"-Button to the EA's visual interface? If clicked, the EA will close the whole grid once its breakeven and disable the EA (to prevent it from opening a new one).

Drawdown monitoring:

Is there any way to display the maximum drawdown of the current grid in term currency and PIPS?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi yousername,

The grid is taking good shape. If you can bring clarity to your methods it will be an excellent manager for Risk Reward and Grid.

I would use it more for  money management than for trading martingale itself.

I would prefer to wait for the trade as per my plan rather than trading impulsively.

Direction is decided by me based upon my view of fundamentals and pairs behaviour. It is totally subjective and is not influenced by any indicator at all.

I divide my trading money in smaller lots and make deep pip pockets (contract values ofcourse are smaller) and trade only after knowing total risk in advance.

If you can set up RR magic lines (two thick shadows), which sets up One position at xxx pips distance from Market Price and another at xxx pips distance in the opposite side of the Market Price. I will manually drag them and see if Risk and Rewards match not only my targets of profit and risk but they tally with my strategy.

I print on chart the indicators of Murrey Math and one more of the following strategies which can print horizontal lines on the chart for medium term (1-3 weeks)

Support and Resistance (zone indicator)

Fibos + Harmonics (road_map)

Fractals (Fractals - adjustable price breakout)

Average Range (daily, weekly, monthly) - DWMranges

Murrey Maths (mostly extreme zones and middle Pivot zone) - MurreyMath-Timeframe rev.

Previous highs and lows (D-w-mn close line)

I aim for confluence.  I will by drag and drop method move about the RR magic lines and visualise the big picture and trade only when I strongly feel that it will achieve 1 risk and 2 reward results.

At the same time I will visualise where the lines for pullbacks should happen. I will also visualise where recovery is needed to lower breakeven or pile up profits.

And then draw those lines.

In short, I am opening a RR box and then setting up smaller webs of probable pullback or recovery and trading with calm. It is like I have laid my fishing net and waiting for the fish to be caught.

I insist only on taking trades which can generate me 1:2 RR so that at the end of the day even if I score 50% loss and 50% profit, I will still be making good profits. Like this.

Three buttons will bring brevity:  (a) Printing Lines (for hypothetical or virtual plotting) which will set up RR box and smaller zones of pullbacks, pyramiding and averaging (inverse pyramiding) (b) Executing Pending Orders selected from the lines after weighing RR and the pros and cons of strategy which imposes horizontal lines on the chart for making quick decisions and finally (c) Managing Manually - after trades have been activated

After the trades are done I use this indicator (Show Average Entry Price) to manage manually. The shadow shows me profit (positive number), breakeven (if it is closer to 0) and loss (negative number) which I need to know how to manually trade in order to bring down loss.I find on mql5 site this RR manager doing similar job. if you feel appropriate, please refine and absorb this in your EA.

Since you are open to ideas, I am sharing my hands-on experience with you. If you think they don't fit in with your plans, please ignore them.

Risk Reward Order Manager

Risk Reward Order Manager is an EA that will help you a lot in order to follow your money management plan.

You only need to set the parameters according with your money management strategy, and drag resistance, support and order levels. And push order button!

EA will do following operations taking of course care of current spreadCalculate risk reward ratio Check if that ratio is in accord with your settings If the operation is in a good risk reward ratio , EA will show you button for place order ELSE he will hide to you so you have to follow your rules He will know which kind of order to set (buy limit, buy stop, sell limit, sell stop) Show you how much (in money) you are going to risk and gain with that operation Show you lotsize calculate for that operation in order to follow your plan Show you how far in pip SL and TP are Draw a red rectangle from order level to SL (possible loss) Draw a green rectangle from order level to TP (possible profit) Draw a lime rectangle (optional, 1 to 1 R/R projection) Important! One to one operation is a bit greater than that. I mean, to be profitable in long term i set default 1 to 1 operation with reward/risk ratio 1,1 that is not an error!

More than this, EA will always show following information:Current spread Minimum lotsize for this pair Pips value in money for 1 lot operation of this pair Amount of money used by stop loss  in ALL open operation by this magic number (in money and in % of free margin)

How Does it work?

Once you set and drag in your strategical level the five horizontal lines drawn by EA on initialization (Strong resistance, medium resistance (dashed) , strong support , medium support (dashed) and yellow  dashed order level line).
EA will calculate possible operation you ll can place. He will figure strong resistance line and strong support line as target , so, in according with your level order positionwill show you only operations you ll can open to follow your money management rules (is a bit difficult to explain for that I invite you to see screen shot and video attached).
EA will show you the button to place standard operation (if those stick to money management) and will show you on chart through green (for profit) and red (for losses) rectangle Place buy limit ( if order level is below price and will set strong resistance as TP and Strong support as SL) Place buy stop ( if order level is above price and will set strong resistance as TP and Strong support as SL) Place sell limit ( if order level is above price, and will set strong resistance as SL and Strong support as TP) Place buy limit ( if order level is below price and will set strong resistance as SL and Strong support as TP) All those button will set a single order with full amount of lotsize calculate according with your settings.

If medium support or resistance are below or above of 1 to 1 risk reward projection EA will give you a choice to:place a full (mean with lotsize calculated by ea) standard operation  place a full (mean with lotsize calculated by ea) 1 to 1 risk reward operation place both operations with one click but with splitted amount of lotsize to follow better the rules You ll find input variables in screenshot and video!

This ea will work with pretty all value pairs plus  xauusd, xagusd , it will not work with a lot of other cfd like uk100, ger30 and so on!

Example of my trade based on Murrey Math zones:

The trade is now breakeven with 200 pips profit as breathing space and aiming at 1:2 reward

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Drawdown monitoring is very essential for the EA as it is progressing.

I have attached a real-time Drawdown monitor (Show me average entry) in my earlier post. You can do it manually if EA doesn't take care of it.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi yousername, I have been demoing your ea the past few days and from what I have observed the danger is when you for example have a Buy grid open and the price drops with little retrace. Big drawdowns then occur and in an unsually big move could possibly end up in a wiped account. Is it possible you could code the EA to have both a Buy and a Sell grid open at the same time?

Thank you and Best rgds

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Well, since we have R:R ratio in the recent build, you could use that in order to avoid big drawdowns.

What's the point having buy and sell orders at the same price other than making the broker richer with fees? Sorry I don't quiet understand where you're going with this.

Maybe did you mean something like this grid? b= buy, s=sell

b

Here is an idea, what about say we have a buy grid and the price starts to go south on us..maybe we you can set an amount. For example we have $10 TP on our buy grid but the prices goes theother way, we can set a price say $20 at which point if we are $20 negative the EA opens a sell trade with an equal amount of lots so if price continues to move away the worst if we close the trades down we would lose $20. If price recovers back under $20 then the sell trade can be closed leaving the buys in the hope it will move North and hit our $10 TP....

Just an idea

Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it. I need some time so swallow the pill. lol

About the "Breakeven"-Button...

Correct me if im wrong, did you mean when you click the button the EA will close the trade when it's in breakeven and disable the EA?

DrawDown monitoring

By drawdown you mean the losing positions monitoring in term of pips and currency?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Guys thanks for the input.

For now i'm gonna improve the RETRY order (its when there's issue placing order).

I will place an input 2 variables that you can set "Retry" and "Retry Time Out (ms)".

If you set Retry to 100 and Retry Time Out to 10ms, then it will retry 100x to place order where each retry has 10ms timeout.

So in worst case scenario it will takes 1000ms to complete the retry. And when the retry fail, it will send an email and alert like the following

EURUSD FAIL PLACING ORDER @1.1234 at 13:00 2017/13/7

Very nice tool!!

Would it be possible to add "lot multiplier" as a new function,

so we could take grid or martingale trades ?

Thanks for your support !

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks mate for your help! I appreciate it. GOd bless

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Yes, I do.

This EA (all the new versions starting from 1.6) enhance that concept.

Look for yourself my detailed exposure down in my attachement.

You can apply RR1:1 very easily now, with the advantage that you can afford now to stand and resisting few levels that market fights against you.

...reloading your chances for a happy result

edit: adjusted error, example now is TP/SL 60 pips (3 orders at 10 pips space for 30 pips swing = 60 pips)

Supplemental lecture :
To set an endless pyramid pendings grid, adding blindly pending orders it's a dangerous thing to do in my opinion. Of course you can close on BreakEven on the market's corrections (for BE, the correction must be >1/2from original swing, ...by courtesy of simnz trader post here above) but over that point, the losing positions aggregate outcome might consume drastically your margin, then emotions creep in and determine a trader (noob mostly) to close too early or too late... getting closer to a glorious account bust
You can be successful for weeks, months, years on pyramidal adding, but is very probable that one sunny day you'll find your margin in a critical situation.
That's why I am for the StopLoss.
Well, even brokers love the StopLoss, because your prolong agony between the full equity strat and the Margin Call, brings them more cash.
But the point is that I use SL for me, not for anyone else.
And is my advice for all of you, guys!
Thank you.

Regarding that you should be able to do it manually.

Maybe by enabling "USE LINES" feature and place 2 horizontal lines.

Each for buy and sell grid.

Then when the price crosses over one of them, a grid will open accordingly.

Isn't that what you want?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
this expert when close open position?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Did you set the AUTOMATIC and START button to green?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yes, if button clicked, the EA will close all open trades once breakeven (so zero profit) is reached and then disable the EA.

The Drawdown maximum (lets say the grid had a maximum drawdown of -30 Usd at -250 Pips) would be interesting to monitor

--- 帖子 #193 ---
yes im using with green button for example buy

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Yes I am still testing the grid line function (is the setting correct for grid line function) attached pic TQ

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Sorry I think I missed to say one more thing from the first time. You must add an identifier before the B or S.

Example below

NAME_1S

or

NAME_2S

or

NAME_1B

or

NAME_2B

1 indicates Grid Style 101

2 indicates Grid Style 111

B indicates BUY Grid

Please try that.

Yep. Like that.

Yes so cool (having fun testing)

p/s am testing closing manually some position within the grids (nice all OK)
Also tested if you have the ea running on a chart (eu) open another chart (eu) and enter the same ea all previous position will close

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I wonder how did you get that kind of idea? (I don't think it's bad/good)

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Abort, abort, sorry

I thought the player can win on both grids if range market  ...because the relative shift of the swing of the trade zone when using TP/SL

But I was wrong.

It's possible indeed to have both grids as winners ...but I reanalysed and just realised that is also the same probability to have them both for a loser

So, no big deal.

Sorry bothering you for nothing

(about the idea, yeah, yeah, I saw the thread posts above, ... of course everybody wants to hedge successfuly  )

--- 帖子 #206 ---
lol

I guess you should be able to do it manually when using 2 EA with different MAGIC NUMBER and same INSTRUMENT and different CHART WINDOW.

Maybe you should try that on a demo account?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
You said

"Also tested if you have the ea running on a chart (eu) open another chart (eu) and enter the same ea all previous position will close"

Yes it should close the grid if both EA has the same MAGIC NUMBER.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Can I change the magic number to run say 2-3 entries grid on same pair different chart?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
yeap, sure buddy,  look here ...you can create a mess ...tons of grids  lololol

yes can done tested 3 magic numbers

Yousername,

The input Grid style set to 111 & when press "111" button the EA Grid style panel will show & stay at "111" but when restart MT4, the Grid style on EA panel will revert to "101". I need to press the "111" button again. Can it stay at last selected grid which is "111" when I restart the MT4 again? Thanks

--- 帖子 #215 ---
theoretically can. I have not test it. Too many to test it by my self. LOL

That's why the forum + people who has interest + people who are willing to test is needed. You are one of them. lol

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Well if the MT4 gets rebooted. The data in the RAM is gone.

So if you want to have a feature like windows sleep/hibernate where when you set it to sleep and login again, you see the same setting as before it put to sleep/hibernate...

Then.... it gets complicated. I need to have a database or have some kind of file to store the last setting. And the MQL4 should have some kind of a function that can detect whether the MT4 is closed because of system error or human error. But I don't think such exist. If it does, then we could work it out on version 1.1.0

But I don't think I'm gonna do it shortly. It's irrelevant to the trading system.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Mate, I think you need a bigger monitor.

The Buy and Sell grid buttons overlap the DATA WINDOW.

I think in version 1.9, I should have a hide/show switch button in order to hide the DATA WINDOW

--- 帖子 #218 ---
No problem, but thank you

...my demos are running on a small netbook  lol ... using it only for tests and new stuff

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thanks for your reply. For my case, sometime I will just close the MT4 program if I am not doing any trade. Anyway, it is ok. I can just press the "111" button again when I open MT4 the next time. Thanks

Any possibility to add a button on screen for user to input a hard stop & tp on all grid position.
I think currently the sl & tp say 25 pips is the average of all current active orders

My Lord, i'm having a back ache for sitting too long coding and testing.

Version 1.8 is done EXCEPT for #4, having some difficulty

Update to the User Interface

I want to clarify one point as seen in the screenshot
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So from the screnshot if you set "How many Stop/Limit Orders per grid" to 100, then you will see GRID SIZE X 2 = 200.

100 LIMIT and 100 STOP pending oder

Please exploit/abuse/rape it to the max.

Let me know if there's any bug or question

I can add some feature on the USE LINES button to close a grid when crossing the horizontal line

i.e.

NAME_TP

NAME_SL

NAME_C

TP = It will take profit (close the grid) when there's profit in the grid

SL = It will stop loss (close the grid) when the grid position is losing

C = It will close the grid

The grid will be close when the price crosses the line accordingly.

What do you think?

==============

BTW I don't understand this part of your message

I think currently the sl & tp say 25 pips is the average of all current active orders
p/s Or additional option at parameters settings sl & tp from last grid order

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I'm considering to have Auto-Breakeven, News, DrawDown (maybe)

Questions

1. You mentioned "embrace the possibility of losing and decide if close the grid completely. "

Let say when the BReakeven button is on.

Big bearish news came out.

YOur bullish grid never reached the breakeven when the news out.

Then what? Keep the losing bullish grid open until it reaches the SL?

2. Displaying maximum drawdown? It's possible, but what for exactly? Can you think of any advantage having such feature for decision taking? If so, please explain it, so maybe I can apply it to the AUTOMATIC trading as well

Could you be more clearer, concise, compact with your posts please?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi yousername,

the Breakeven-idea must come into play hours before any high impact actually happens. Its nothing more than a attemp to get out of the grid before things getting serious. If activated but breakeven never reached, its up to our own to act.

Having the maximum drawdown gives a better feeling when the EA is traded manually (using lines). Im basing my manual entrys mostly by harmonic pattern. Having the maximum drawndown will help to compare, which patterns/entry might be most profitable without large drawdowns.

Besides, most of us just dont monitor their grids all the time so if i check them once in a while i just get the temporary impression of the drawdown.

Thanks much

DT

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Well for the drawdown, I believe you can use FF TE or any other web site TE.

I mean like have several MT4 accounts hence several TE.

Each EA in the MT4 terminals is dedicated to its own strategy (what ever pattern you want to set).

By then you could know which pattern is best for you and the grid.

The breakeven button, I guess I will apply that.

Thanks Dtde, I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
As I am very bad at giving a user guide.

I really appreciate for anyone to COMPILE a USER GUIDE for using FlexyGrid.

That's fair right?

Thanks TudorIoan for the explanation and thanks yousername for all your hard work.

I've downloaded and am trying it out, but due to lack of time i'm struggling to keep up with all the posts and updates.

I've set to TudorIoan settings, but can someone explain why if i buy the first thing EA does is sell and vice versa? thanks

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Late reply fell asleep dreaming of Grids. On the risk reward currently if set tp 25 pips. To hit 25 pips is base on active average price (e.g. 3 orders short.  (1.3310 / 1.3305 / 1.3300) tp 25 pips. ?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Never mind I just hit the 111 button......still playing around

it would be interesting to try this at News time. set a sell with a SL of 30 and TP of 60 and a buy with the same.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I presume you used GRID STYLE 101

Here's a scheme of Gridstyle 101, BUY GRID

Buy Stop

Sell

Buy Limit

Sell is the center of the grid

Buy Stop and Buy Limit are the bulk orders above and below the center grid.

So the SELL is meant to be a losing position that got hedged by the Buy orders.

Grid Style 111 Buy

Buy Stop

Buy

Buy Limit

As you can see the center of the grid is buy. On top and bottom of it is similar to 101 Grid Style concept, hence there's no hedge or single losing opened order

GRID STYLE 110 Buy

Buy Stop

Buy

Sell Stop

Grid Style 110 could not >1 hedge position depending where the market is going. I could have 4 Sell and 5 Buy trade or many other possibilities

I hope you get what I mean. If you don't I can illustrate it in a MT4 chart.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hahahaha

I think you should go back to sleep mate.

I still don't understand your question

"To hit 25 pips is base on active average price (e.g. 3 orders short. (1.3310 / 1.3305 / 1.3300) tp 25 pips. "

Grid style 101, BUY GRID

Buy Stop

Buy Limit

Sell is the center of the grid

Buy Stop and Buy Limit are the bulk orders above and below the center grid.

So the SELL is meant to be a losing position that got hedged by the Buy orders.

Grid Style 111 Buy

Buy Stop

As you can see the center of the grid is buying. On top and bottom of it is similar to 101 Grid Style concept, hence there's no hedge or

Many thanks man

I guess this could be an anoying issue and confusing. I didn't thought this in mind because most brokers now are offering 5 digits instead 4.

PIPS SETTING

5.0 = 50 PIPS 4 decimal acc / 5 pips 5 decimal acc

I think I will put this in my urgent list.
Im going to make it same across regardless 4 or 5 digit broker
4 pips in 5 digit broker = 4 pips in 4 digit broker

I need some idea for the AUTOMATIC trading. I want to make it a little bit smarter.

I wanted it able to know which grid is suitable for the current condition (Ranging/Trending) market.

I wanted it also able to know a suitable R:R for different situation (high impact to medium impact news). Let say when a high impact news came, then it will setup a particular grid with lower risk and higher reward (1:10);

Maybe in the AUtomatic, I want the EA to place a GRID when it's crossing a particular MURAY MATH lines.

I think before making the AUTOMATIC to be smarter. First we must have the news feature into the MANUAL mode.

For Automatic, I think it is best to leave the buttons as minimal as possible. I mean I want it to be super smart, that it doesn't need any human intervention like adjusting the logic etc. Everything is done by it self, it has its own market awareness or conciousness

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Exactly, once manual logic is perfected then only automated trigger can be enhanced to search and destroy high profile targets. E.g. news. Using 110 type grid on an impulse reaction etc

p/s some examples: Key supply & demand area (with indicator matching eg stoch 15/5/5 with RSI 33 below 50) extended pivots / elastic bars (expansion more than 100 pips on eg H1) scanning all Pairs etc

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I believe I have resolved the digit issue with 4 digits broker when placing the grid.

Please exploit it and let me know if there's any issue.
Inserted Code double brokerDigitsIssue(double pips)
{
double points=0;
//4 ot 2 decimal currency/instrument pairs hence a 4 digit broker
if(MathMod(Digits,2)==0){
return pips/MathPow(10,Digits);
}
//5 or 3 decimal currency/instrument  pairs hence a 5 digit broker
else{
return NormalizeDouble((pips/MathPow(10,Digits))*10,Digits);
}  Attachment 4 //Old one, I just re upload a new one

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Perfect pips value now same for 4 & 5 decimal acc

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Thanks OK Shop for the confirmation! I appreciate your bug testing result

Now that can be put aside. Time to add some feature for v1.9 that I have listed earlier

1. Closing order grid from inside out of the grid.

2. Preserve the last setting whenever the VPS/Laptop/PC got crashed/burned/shutdown

3. Add additional feature on the USE LINES like in here

This next version will take a while to be implemented especially #2 and #1
Both are very important basic security features before making the EA more advance.

-Thank you for EA FLEXY GRID_1.7 It works very well in automation.

Maybe you downloaded the old version of 1.8

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post10084483

You want me to explain each setting?

I thought it's descriptive/self explantory enough in the EA's properties?

Please be more specific, which setting do you want me to explained?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Do we have an auto BE function?

Here is the logic:

The example is for the both cases, Buy Grids and Sell Grids

And the example is for the both cases, Winning Grid and Loser Grid.

I showed them different targets (different swings) for a better illustration of the concept.

The example shows that it always exists a BE level, no matter if Buy Grids or Sell Grids, Winning Grids or Losing Grids...

The example shows that the BE level is always at 1/2 correction from the original swing.(mind the spread calculus deviation)

I guess the main purpose of a BE option (after the trading Grid is already started) is to offer the opportunity to abort the trend or that particular market bias if the player has no longer analytical and tactical reasons to belive in it and in the same time to have the chance to get a BE if he let that Grid alive.

Caution: if you let a losing Grid alive (uncontroled), it might consume hard your Margin before market will come back at that particular 1/2 correction of the original swing !

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Ha. Ha.

Kiddin', right?
(break even)

--- 帖子 #276 ---
How do you tell the BE level is always at 1/2 correction from the original swing?

Yeah I know what you mean. I believe I have promised some one to add a BE button. I can't recall who. But I remembred I promised.

hahaha sorry I'm not used to jargons. I know breakeven

Ohh boy, this is no problem. Yeah I will place a BE button. Maybe BE is a good name.

BREAKEVEN- Green light

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yeap, finally, everybody knows now that BE stands for breakeven, no problem  lol

And yes, the BE level is always at half way back of the original movement (1/2 correction from the original swing) ...see drawings above

(edit: ...and mind that fkn spread deviation for your calculations)

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Yeah I always take spread into account.

Hahahha i never heard any one talk to me "Hey man, have your business BE yet?"

--- 帖子 #281 ---
For feng shui purpose hope be setting will be as below

--- 帖子 #282 ---
ROTF, of course BE - a big zero profit - sounds as a stupid target...

But I guess in trading is sometimes better to quit a weak trend while you are still in a small profit or at some no loss (zero profit) level/point

--- 帖子 #283 ---
LOL, sure you will be able to set the breakeven value to your own liking. You will be able to set it in the EA's properties.

Here's a layman logic of the Breakeven logic.

1. Grid opened

2. You clicked the breakeven button to green

3. The grid only has 1 opened position at start

4. Further down the line the market executed some of your pending orders.

5. when you have >=2 order gets executed + breakeven button is green = BREAKEVEN function starts working.

You will also be able to set the breakeven function will be run there are >=X active orders.

SO there will be 3 paratemers

Parameter 1) Use Breakeven? (Boolean)

Parameter 2) Breakeven amount (double amount $$$)

Parameter 3) Breakeven triggered after X opened orders (integer)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Totally agree with you

--- 帖子 #285 ---
#1 and #2 are challenging. I think i dont want to waste so much time on it.

If any one is willing to take the challenge or provide a method for #1 and #2 then I guess we all will be happier.

Let me know if anyone is interested, I'll tell you what the main issue is.

Anyhow

I will go ahead adding more feature into the EA as the following

- BREAK EVEN button

- Add additional feature on the USE LINES

--- 帖子 #286 ---

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I place one 2B & one 2S at upper and lower candle before high impact news.

Order close(2B) after hitting R:R target but immediately it auto start to place order again. I press "close grid" button and again it started another auto place order. The auto trade only discontinued after I deleted 2S line. Is there any setting that I done wrongly? thanks

--- 帖子 #289 ---
When you closed the grid, did you keep the line on?

Because if you do, it will keep open a grid whenever the price touches the line

In the next build probably I will make sure the EA rename the horizontal line (REMOVEs THE _2B etc)

Thanks for pointing out the issue! I appreciate it mate. God bless

--- 帖子 #290 ---

Is there any issue with it?

1. Do the other buttons update its input when it is clicked except for grid style?

2. Also when you restart the MT4 do the buttons stay the same as last seen (before reboot)?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Perfect. All OK accept during parameters settings when select 111 it reverts back to 110 when on screen, Thereafter once on screen all ok even after change TF it stays at 111. Only during parameters setting.

***Test done on mt4 shutdown/crash when open all parameters retain on screen accept grid style setting revert back to 101

double confirm is this correct 101
Grid style 101, EG BUY GRID VISE VERSA FOR SELL

Buy is the center of the grid

Sell Stop and Sell Limit are the bulk orders above and below the center grid.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I did not read anything on this tread, except the name. My friend 'okshop' posts here and this drag my attention.

Being doing grid EAs 3 years in a row. During the last year I have abandoned all grids. But that is not important.

During the last months, i have decided to experiment, just for fun, with my old grid EAs.

I want to share the basics here. This might save you some years of research or eventually just trow your EA in the bin?!?

The grid EAs became nice performers, when I set the multiplier to x1.10 or x1.15. Individual trade TP of 400+ pips. Mininal SL of -30 pips. Higher SL pips values might even perform better, I guess.

Cent accounts are the right place for the grid and most martingale based EAs. Do not abandon your EAs. Go live on a cent account instead. Most if not all EAs will be doing perfectly well in any cent account.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks for the update my dear friend & I 1001% agree with you. Love that you share your experience and save all of us from going to hell lol. This grid ea will be the ultimate EA as it represents the number 1 killer (physiological approach to trading) I am using this EA more as a Personal Assistant to managed my trade with a set TP & SL No multiplier involved and minimum grid (future development is to identify high profile target) btw I love you pervious tips on using zig zag

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Please also get involved with this small & humble project your experience will be good. ***high profile set up TQ whenever you are available

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I know lotta sane people who would agree that pyramidal adding or any martingale scheme should be throwed in the bin. It's maybe right to do so.

But this EA offers the opportunity for some of us to develope a particular application which can control risk.

You should read more than the name of the thread before say smth. ..that's.a good advice in life too, to know what's all about before express anything

After doing some investigation on the FLEXY GRID's setting reset to default whenever the MT4 rebooted or change template.

I found come to a conclusion.

Whenever you modify the value of the "EXTERN" variable when the program/EA is running, it won't be reflected into the EA Properties.

Please try this EA for your self and see what I mean.

Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//|                                                  test Sample.mq4 |

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
#property copyright   "2005-2014, MetaQuotes Software Corp."
#property link        "http://www.mql4.com"
extern double test = 50;

int init(){
Alert("A ",test);
test=11;// simulate a button clicked.
Alert("B, ",test);
/*
go check the EA property.the Test input doesnt change from 50 to 11.
That is the issue with the button
*/
}

As seen in the example above we have 1 extern variable as input called "test". Its value is initialized with value 50.

Then when the init() method executed when the program run.

You will see a pop up message "A 50"

Lets pretend that button clicked and modify the test's value to 11.

It will show another pop message "B, 11".

Once you see those pop up messages, go and check the EA properties and see whether the test value changed from 50 to 11?

So that is the issue with the FlexyGrid's buttons. It will fall back to the default value everytime the template reload or MT4 got rebooted.

A solution is to set your fall back default value.

You can do so at the beginning when you first attached the EA into the chart. That is your only chance to modify the EA's property. Then when the EA is attached, you won't be able to modify the EA's property and you have to start over again. However you can still able change other properties such as the R:R value, lot size value etc on the fly. Once you have set the EA property, you may save it into a template and it will fallback to your default setting whenever you reload the template or reboot the MT4.

Regarding the "GRID STYLE" button, it will be fix in the version 1.9

--- 帖子 #332 ---
At the Breakeven button trigger doesn't stop the automatic trade yet because I want to place my focus to MANUAL trading mode before we go FULLY AUTOMATION

I also applied some cosmetic changes

1. The MANUAL and AUTOMATIC button stays green because there's no need for it to change color to red. You can tell it's manual and automatic by seeing the BUY/SELL/CLOSE button. When you see those 3 buttons then, it's a MANUAL mode.

2. I removed TRADING WITH LINE and TRADING STYLE out of the grid info (top right corner)

Any how here is the latest FlexyGrid version 1.9

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi,

I worked on EAs for many years, most important things you need to keep in mind Specially with Grid Trading EAs:

1- Your Broker's Execution Slippage

2- Your Broker's Spreads

all EAs made good profit in the backtest from the big moves, and in big moves all Brokers make the spreads higher and you will have big slippage.

because that, there are millions of EAs work crazy in the backtest but on live account they dead.

Regards

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Probably in the next 1 or 3 versions of FlexyGrid. You will be able to send command/task lists to FG just like how you do it on SIRI/Virtual Assistance.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi Yousername,

Thank you for posting in the thread I opened earlier and thank you for the hard work you are putting into developing this EA.

From the image below is using Horizontal Lines for Entering a Buy Grid, of this type, correct?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Thanks for the feedback

In the EA I set the Maximum spread to 5 and slippage to 8.

I hard coded to the EA.

BUt I will put it into the input because there could be some one who uses grids on an instrument that has higher spread than 5.

Thanks for your feedback! I appreciate it

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Correct, make sure before the _1A or _2B etc, there's a name.

_1A, _2B are a command word that follows after the Name

So like this.

LINE_1A

LINE_2B etc

When you execute 2B, it will executes a BUY GRID with GRID STYLE 111

--- 帖子 #340 ---
is the horizontal lines bug fix where the previous line still activates a new entry. (I can’t test on live yet as market is not open

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Yes, once a price executes the Horizontal line, Flexy Grid removes COMMANDS (i.e. _2B) from the Horizontal's name. So that way when Flexy Grid touches that particular line again, it won't open another of the same grid twice,thrice,infinity

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Here are the several command that I'm planning to create

FG = Flexy Grid's short name

TASK = Task list

#= Order of the task

FG_TASK_#

So

FG_TASK_1_2B_OPEN_PRICE_XXXXX

FG_TASK_2_CLOSE_PRICE_XXXXX

FG_TASK_3_2B_OPEN_TIME_XXXXX

FG_TASK_4_CLOSE_PROFIT_XXXXX_MONEY

FG_TASK_5_2B_OPEN_TIME_XXXXX

FG_TASK_6_CLOSE_PROFIT_XXXXX_PIPS

Another command will be Initialize button. FG will initialize listed buttons whenever template changed or MT4 rebooted

FG_INITAILIZE BUTTONS_BREAK EVEN_MANUAL_USE LINES_111

You have to list the BUTTONS name after "INITIALIZE BUTTONS". Also you don't have to put it in order.

Let say if you don't type "BREAK EVEN", it won't turn on that button.

Here's an example on initalize AUTOMATIC and START button. So that mean everytime the MT4 got rebooted, FG will start the AUTOMATIC EAs function and the other buttons that are not in the INITIALIZE COMMAND, FG will not turn it on.

FG_INITIALIZE BUTTONS_AUTOMATIC_START

NEW UPDATE to FlexyGrid 1.9

Now you can Breakeven based on 3 statements

PIPS, MONEY AMOUNT and OPENED/EXECUTED ORDERS.

If one of the 3 statements is true, then the Breakeven function will start working.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You also can modify the SLIPPAGE and SPREAD.

If the MARKET SPREAD > your SPREAD then no grid will be open thus the SPREAD info color becomes red.

Else you will be able to open a GRID, and the SPREAD info color becomes green

--- 帖子 #346 ---
As you can see in the screenshot the "BREAKEVEN" info text is green which means that the Breakeven has been triggered.

Why? Because there are already 5 opened orders.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #347 ---
May I know what the difference as per pic mark 1. Also e.g. if I only want to use say pips do I set BE true pips say 10 and the rest at 0 ?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Good question

set the other 2 input triggers that are not used as high as possible (9999999999).

But this way will make the BREAKEVEN info text looks bad. I will update the code again

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Thank you for using your time to write the EA for us to use.

Peace be with you.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
For x amount of currency e.g. 25000 = 25k and for 1 = usd1 ?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Code updated. I remove other info in the BREAKEVEN.

It will only display true.

True/false changes when ever the button is clicked.

Color changes whenever the break trigger condition is meet

So if you only want to use 1 out 3 triggers, then set the other 2 triggers value to something like 9999999999

5 is your spread tolerance level.

If the market spread is above your spread tolerance then no grid will be opened.

I don't display slippage, because the 1% doesn't care about it

I'm not cheap person who care about spread and slippage.

But people ask, so why not display the spread.

I still can win regardless how big the spread is.

You will retrieve the LIVE SPREAD with this code
Inserted Code MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_SPREAD)

--- 帖子 #356 ---
From my experience ,spread is a big issue for all kind of grid trading . What usually happen, is spread sudden widen(occurs all the time, sometimes it's a deliberate action by broker) trigger pending stop order then reverse direction, very frustrating.

That's why a better approach is to use limit order instead of stop order. For buy order, EA monitors current Bid price, as soon as Bid price across above grid line (Ask price for sell order),place buy limit order at grid level, price will normally retrieve a bit trigger the limit order then continue go up. In a price rapid moving situation ,limit order probably won't be triggered, but hey, missing trade is always better than enter risky trade.

Well, minding the spread is not necessarly about being cheap. eaX mebmer pointed out that there are millions of EAs work crazy in the backtest but on live account they dead just because crazy floating spreads and slppge.

possible issue with ordersend, slippage. In the code I converted the slippage input to 0.00xxx I just fixed it because it only accepts integer

Thanks for you also for sharing and I hope for you more and more success.

For me I always put my EAs on many accounts with deferent Brokers and link them to FF trade explorer and compare the results, for example last week I found my main account made a half of other account's profit because 90% of my trades had a negative 3-5 pips slippage and when I contacted my Broker they say it's normal to have positive and negative slippage and we can't control it, I told them OK but I have 90% of my trades with only Negative slippage, they only bla bla bla, now I will change my main account to other Broker which has less slippage and has a nice 'Volatility Protection Settings Page' I will try with them and see.

yousername,

My suggestion on having compact interface. My suggestion for each module :

Screen Panel should have

Money Manage,

Plot,

Execute,

Order Manage

1. Money Manage:

Contract value to trade: 1k/10k/100k

Accounting Currency: US/EUR/Stg

Open Price: Market value

1 Pip value: (calculated by above three factors)

How much to trade: % of Equity (to calculate total pips that can be used and for lots)

Total No of pips to trade: xxxx (based on % of equity) or calculated manually and input.

Total quantity of lots that can be traded (based on total no of pips available)

Equity Risk Stop: XXX pips

The information will be printed as text on any selected corner of the screen.

Plot sets up hypothetical /virtual order lines, calculates risk/reward and allows drag and drop moving of lines to desired Pending Order placement.

Execute converts plotted lines into pending orders. Execute can be treated as a trigger Button for later stages as well to activate any embedded or indicator supplied strategy with its own Magic Number by adding an indicator trigger option.

Manage shows the progress of the trade , drawdown, trailing loss/profit, breakeven, facilitates adding or decreasing lots to manage drawdown and lower breakeven.

Ideal is by way of a moving shadow between Entry Average Price and Market Price. ALERT should trigger push notification on selection of pips drawdown, breakeven, proft/loss levels etc as desired by the user.

--------------

--- 帖子 #390 ---
cool, it fits nice at the bottom right corner  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Plot (for news events or future planned days)

Direction: Up, Down, Both

Time-based: yes or no.

Both direction and timebased Yes selection will set up straddle (up and down) lines with different TP, and different SL for each direction and OCO (one cancels other order type). Time : start and end (2 SEPARATE INPUTS) : DD: HH: MM:SS. Trade expiry: XXX minutes after Start. tOTAL 3 INPUTS FOR TIMEBASED ORDER

Use Risk/Reward Lines (pips): Yes or No. Yes will show Market Price as default value and with an option to change the price level and open one line above market price/intended price and another below market price/intended price as per Risk in pips distance. Drag and Drop Lines to change Risk Reward will be ideal.

Do you want to set up straddle or individual trade or grid: Stradle or Invidividual selection will jump to set up lines.

Push Execute button ONLY when you want to convert the lines displayed into Pending Order.

Execute will convert lines into Pending orders with TP and SL.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Plot (for directional trading)

direction: Up, down, Both

Time-based: No will show up Grid selection will ask for grid styles as per direction selected. Grid Style will be final selector. One grid style can be for UP direction, Second for Down and third one for BOTH directions.

If selected Both direction, Up and down grids should not have fixed TP and SL. Both should have flexibility with varying TP and SL inputs.

Not necessary to fill grid trades individually with TP and SL.

If selected both, Up direction can have grid of say 6 grids at a distance of 10 pips each with its own lots, TP and SL and at the same time Down direction can have

3 grids at a distance of 8 pips each with its own lots , TP and SL in the same single grid style.

Panel should be able to display all major inputs (excepting perhaps grid style inputs on pips distance, lot quantity, SL and TP etc) on the screen itself.

Alerts: proper planning of push mail/email alert messages will help save a lot of screen watching time. VERY VITAL IF MOBILE PHONE TRADING IS DESIRED.

Ok, I used to be an EUR/USD thread dweller, now I promise to control myself and to adjust my behaviour to your thread's standards

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I hope some time this month or next couple of month.

Traders will only care about making their own signal and feed it into FG.

Let FG trade and follow the money management that you set i.e. R:R, Breakeven etc.

I'm thinking the signal value that can be fed to FG will be the following

1 = buy

0 = neutral

-1 = sell

11 = close order/grid

1111 - buy using grid 111

1110 - sell using grid 111

1011 - buy using grid 101

1010 - sell using grid 101

1101 - buy using grid 110

1100 - sell using grid 110

--- 帖子 #396 ---
This will be an important upgrade, running different strategy test for the evolution of FG working as a team saves many screen hours.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
When this feature come, I will license the EA and only selected few who are willing to be open and share the result to any one in the group.

From your feedbacks. At the moment I will pick one, CUSTOM GRID.

The custom grid parameter will be something like the follow

[10,5,1][10,10,5][10,20,20]

The example above there are 3 levels in the grid

first level has 10 orders, 5 pip distance, 1 lot per pending order.

2nd level has 10 orders, 10 pip distance, 5 lot per pending order

3rd level has 10 orders, 20 pip distance, 20 lot per pending order

You can have UNLIMITED until the broker dropped.

Thank you for showing your effort drawing your idea. I appreciate it.

I will spend some more time going through your feedback later.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Regarding direction are you referring to the buy/sell/neutral SIGNAL?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi all.On auto mode ,for creating new pendings,can it be according to the middle line of daily fibo lines or optional to other timeframes midline.İf prices were over the midline of daily fibo line it will open buy pendings and if under the midline it will open sell pendings .And on changing of order type pending order lots may be as incremental or multiplying style.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
fyi AUTOMATIC mode can't trade using lines or anything. It is fully automated relying on the signal.

USE LINES only for manual.

Yes it is possible, but I think it is better if you do it later when the SIRI like feature is ready. By then you can use your custom indi and feed a buy/sell signal to FG from your custom indi.

Meanwhile I will go build a custom function for lot options (fixed,incremental,multiplying style)

here as a reference to the SIRI like function

I have managed to make FG remembers its button settings.

Checking. You right

Fixed

1. Trade with H line I didn't set the Trade with H line flag to true. That why it never executed that particular function.

2. Auto save on the button settings. This time it will remember the last button setting regardless the VPS crashed, MT4 rebooted, changed template

it will be possible if you code the indi your self and feed the buy sell signal to FG after the CUSTOM SIGNAL feature is ready.

In the future traders will only be worry on the signal, not the money or risk management or setting type of order/grid.

Just send your custom signal, FG will handle the request accordingly

--- 帖子 #417 ---
In future is it like a web base entry signal where user can feed their signal to web for his/her accounts which act like a master & slave.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
not like that mate.

For custom signal, trader must provide their MQL4 file and .SET file.

Then run the FG_CUSTOM SIGNAL command and FG will follow whatever signal feed produced from the custom MQL4.

FG_CUSTOM SIGNAL will be licensed/available to selected few.

Anyone who is not chosen will still be able to use FG except FG_CUSTOM SIGNAL feature.

That's the plan.

BREAKEVEN UPDATE

I have decided to use the breakeven only based on 2 Factors instead 3. I removed the breakeven feature that is based on the X opened orders.

If one of the 2 factor is true then the breakeven function will be executed

TESTING IT FIRST ON MY BACKYARD

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I just want to say

The trigger x pips/money amount will be triggered if the pips and amount you input is >0.

It will not be triggered if the pips and money that you input are a negative value

WHY? Because the point of Breakeven is to not make a winning grid become a losing grid when the market is moving not as expected.

For example if your GRID is in a green area, and the market suddenly go south, then the BE will save you from falling of the cliff.

Good point. It wouldn't make too much sense to have BE triggerd based on X opened orders.

Break even is not depending on the number of orderes.

BE is the level always situated at half way of the grid, no matter how many orderes any particular grid has.

But I think it still be useful the have the possibility to call break even,... even on a losing grid.

Because a trader can hope that the price will turn in his favor doing a small correction  before hitting his SL(his maximum affordable risk), to a minimum recovery point, and that it would be the BE level situated at the half way of a negative losing grid

(refer to my drawings above on the thread)

--- 帖子 #432 ---
1 question say we a trading with set parameters then along the way decide to use lines will this supersede the parameters setting

NAME_TP

NAME_SL

NAME_C

--- 帖子 #433 ---
The parameter set in the lines are independent to the EAs param. It won't be reflected to the EA's setting.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Good point. If that's the case I will place another input variable for losing BE.

So there will be 4 params.

2 for losing BE

2 for winning BE

--- 帖子 #435 ---
No. Is not the case. It would be redundant to have 2 buttons.

As break even means 0 pips or 0 $amount, doesnt matter if grid is bullish or bearish, and doesnt matter if grid is losing or winning.

But you said "the BE will not be triggered if the pips and money that you input are a negative value" ...well, I just want to be sure that BE is triggered ( one button's enough) even the grid is losing.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
There will only be one button but 4 params.

If the 2 params of a losing BE is set>0 then losing BE will not be activated.

If the 2 params of a winning BE is set<0 then the winning BE will not be activated

If there's only 2 params and shared between losing/winning then it's not convenience I reckon.

Replied from McDonald's

--- 帖子 #437 ---
After introducing BE to FG there are situation where sometime it hang. E.g. AU just now hang. Had to reload EA to the chart and when reload all grid closes. But another pair GU running ok.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I'm not sure where this misunderstanding comes... in my opinion BE doesnt depend on losing/winning and it should be convinient to be called whenever trader feels the choosen trend is fading.

All I want is to have the opportunity to call BE ( to push that button) when I feel the trend I choose is fading... not the aprioric mode like "set and forget", wich could rise some issues for the strategy logic or for the coder.

The way i see it is simple, -> i push the button to call BE at any moment I want and then means that when the pips or $ reaches zero, EA closes all and stop. Mind that the StopLoss remains active until all stop!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I see. You right. If that's the case then there's no need to have a BE trigger price/pips.... What was I thinking... So when the button is pressed, whenever the grid reaches the BE price, grid will be closed.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Did it hanged when BE?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Exactly. Mind though that the SL must remain active after calling BE ...because that BE can possibly wont ever hit  but SL must protect you whatever happens

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Ya of course it should.

What if you are in Automatic mode?

What triggers the BE?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I think it got something to do with the connection from button on screen to the parameter setting (not sure) currently I am using direct from parameter setting I notice it happens when trading with lines activation. There a mysterious bug lol. 1 question when e.g. on screen click deactivate BE will the parameters setting change to false & vise versa?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
So it hanged when you tried to open a grid using line? What parameter did you input into the horizontal name?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Or is it due to me running 2 separate ea on the same pair? I got 1 running on vps and 1 FG on pc same pair lol

ps But different charts and different magic number

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I need to know what command did you put into the Horizontal line on the AUDUSD pair?

Please try recall the command you input.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Horizontal Line 26883_S2 (JUST the standard line name i just added _S2

P/S I currently deactivate all BE in parameters & screen (all ok)

--- 帖子 #448 ---
If I follow TudorIon's advise.

When you set the BE on before you open a grid.

And THen when you open a grid, once the grid opened, it will close by it self because it thinks it is BreakEven already.

So suggestion, before you will place a a grid make sure the BreakEven button is off (red) so your grid won't be closed by the BE function.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I just scrapped my previous BE setup.

Now this is a new setup.

BE doesn't have any trigger to be activated. It is always On and will close the grid when ever it reaches the BE target. But it still can be switched off and on

The issue now is that the C,TP,SL doesn't work. :Facepalm:

Actually never mind. It didn't work because I didn't clicked the USE LINES button to green

--- 帖子 #454 ---
something is wrong with the be function it closes the grid eg set 30 pip profit but when it hits the set be ea think it's TP
IT closes exactly at the set be e.g. 10 pips it close as saying be hit

--- 帖子 #455 ---
This BE is almost similar to Take Profit except that BE == xxxx where TP >= xxxx

Actually I don't understand the problem that you mentioned.

What R:R value did you set?

By any chance did you set the BE to 30?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
E.g. if I set tp say 30 pips and BE 10 pips will the sl be move to BE after an average of 10 pips (meaning sl+0)
R:R 30/30 (stop limit per grid = 2) i converted the currency to have 10 pips be
It is currently taking profit on BE amount if set be true volume per grid 0.50

--- 帖子 #457 ---
As the BE doesn't have a trigger the BE is almost similar as TP

1.So when you open a trade and it has 1 pip profit.

2. Then you turned on the BE with 10 pip

3. When the grid goes from 1 to 10 pip profit, it will BE regardless how big your R:R ratio is.

As you can see, because there's no trigger on the BE, it acted as if it's like TP.

So here's the advise.

If you set BE to 30, you better turn it on after your grid has >BE+10 pips profit (in this case 40) just to be safe.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Ok2 understood (high tech BE)

--- 帖子 #459 ---
ROFL

I still prefer the BE with trigger.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I also prefer be and line when not in use as grey lol same as close grid color
p/s This latest be is confusing to me and I personally would find a good use maybe in future

Disabled = gray

Enabled = green

Is that what you mean?

I think there should be consistency.

Red = disableld

Green = active

Except for the buy and sell button

Gray = close, to separate them from the buy/sell button

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Regarding BE, I will make it more intelligent by using FG command

FG_ENABLE BE_AFTER AMOUNT_XXX_BE AMOUNT_XXX

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Pardon me but why you dont delete breakeven function as a result.But as to me, incremental or multiplying function on changing order type would be more important

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Yeah soon I will make a function that allows users to increment the lot size in the grid.

for instance let say you want to have 20 buy stop orders.

you input following value 2,1.5x

2 = every 2 orders

1.5x = pip multiplied by 1.5 times or 150%

.

.

2.25 bs

2.25 bs (5th order, pip increase 150%)

1.5 bs

1.5 Bs (3rd order, pip increase 150%)

1 Bs

1 Bs

1 Buy

1 BL

1 BL

1.5 BL (3rd order, pip increase 150%)

1.5 BL

2.25 BL (5th order, pip increase 150%)

2.25 BL

.

.

I think I won't gonna use a user interface for this. Instead I will use FG command. Just to make things simple....

UI (User interface) has limitation especially with screen space.

as example above, the command will be like the following

FG_CUSTOM GRID LOT_MUTIPLY_2_1.5

Yes, I have planned this before. Maybe this time forward I will just use COMMAND LINE in order to call a function instead using BUTTONS.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Sorry, I was offline.

And I still need the BE button.

I see it very simple:

1. it's stupid to have break even started apriori, from the start of the grid because the aggregate result will become zero for a thousand times, stopping the grid before any advance, any progress.

2. but, for instance, if I start a EUR/USD bullish grid, following a bullish signal, following a bullish technical setup/trend and for a while I feel lucky, on the wave, in profit for a few hundreds of pips ...but afterwhile, US data inflation comes good for USD, hence I'll expect bearish turn, a pull back, but I will not stop the bullish winning grid, I'll just press the BE button, BE it will stop all at zero if violent turn. In the same time I will still be open for the bullish side for the case market will ignore the fundamental update and will keep go north, towards my TP.

That's my view.

Ok, this issue is not the most important, is not a priority, is not urgent. Just take your time.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Sure. Just make sure everytime before you place a grid... The BE button is off in order to avoid getting breakeven and grid got closed at 0.

Hi,

First, I'll like to thank you for sharing this amazing EA. I am not a programmer, but have used lots of EA's and this one has run perfectly so far, and is very well made . Love the buttons, makes it so easy to use.

I've been testing it manually from the 1st version and onwards. You guys are very productive and fast. It's hard to keep up.

At the moment I'm testing using the lines, and have run into an issue. It opens the grid on the lines no problem, but it doesn't register in the box to the right, and it doesn't close once it's hits profit target. Also, I can't seem to use the buttons on the right, e.i the close grid button doesn't work. I am using the latest 1.9 version. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Kind regards

If you are a programmer.

Your indi can actually open a grid with USE LINE.

Let say your indi says to buy.

When your indi gives a buy alert, it has to draw a HORIZONTAL LINE with name_2B or name_2S

Then you place the HORIZONTAL LINE at the market price.

If you want to close the order then draw the line and type name_C or name_TP or name_SL

--- 帖子 #499 ---
FG COMMAND is it calling a close grid indi as per pic ?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Yes indeed.

Your indi has to draw a TEXT OBJECT with name FG_CLOSE.

FG will close accordingly and delete the FG_CLOSE command once grid has been closed

Alternatively as for now, you can use the HORIZONTAL_C at the market price in order to close the order.

If you place at the market price, there's a likelihood the market touches the HORIZONTAL_C

In the latest update to v1.9 you will have to double click it in order to enable the button!

With FG Command, your indicator will be able manipulate FG's parameter.

You will also able to execute and close grid.

All you have to do is create a TEXT OBJECT and set the name with FG COMMAND

FG will executes all TEXT OBJECT that contains FG COMMAND and will delete the TEXT OBJECT after the command got executed.

Let's presume you code your Indi.

When your indi produces a BUY signal and you want to execute a buy order.

Place a code as follow into your Indi buy signal function

Inserted Code ObjectCreate(0,"FG_GRID STYLE_111",OBJ_TEXT,0,0,0);
ObjectCreate(0,"FG_EXECUTE GRID_1",OBJ_TEXT,0,0,0);
FG_GRID STYLE_111 = Set Grid style to 111
FG_EXECUTE GRID_1 = Execute buy grid
FG_EXECUTE GRID_0 = Execute sell grid

Make sure you follow 2 steps above

1. Set the grid style using the Grid Style command

2. Execute the grid using the Execute Grid command

Thanks

--- 帖子 #517 ---
are you using latest EA post #486 ?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Have you checked the setting in the EA. The OOTB setting of the "Grid trading limit per day" is 1.

You can see a screenshot at post #484 (in the screenshot the setting is 999)

--- 帖子 #519 ---
For now FG is able to accept your COMMAND.

The USE LINES command

So let say you have a sell signal.

Your indi has to draw a horizontal line with name "YOUR HORIZONTAL NAME_2S"

If you want to set the TP, you have to draw a horizontal line with name "YOUR HORIZONTAL NAME_C"

_2S = Sell using Grid 111

_C = Close grid

So here's a code example
Inserted Code //Presuming you want to execute order immediately at the Ask price, do as follow
ObjectCreate(0,"YOUR HORIZONTAL NAME_2S",OBJ_HLINE,0,0,Ask);

//Close grid at price 1.1111
ObjectCreate(0,"YOUR HORIZONTAL NAME_C",OBJ_HLINE,0,0,1.1111);

Another example

If you want to place a pending order then you should change from Ask price to your own price. Let say the current price is 1.1234, your pending order is 1.1255
Inserted Code ObjectCreate(0,"YOUR HORIZONTAL NAME_2S",OBJ_HLINE,0,0,1.1255);
This mean the COMMAND _2S will be executed with it got touch.

FYI, you can trade without having a grid.

If you don't want to trade with grid, you can set the GRID SIZE to 0 and set the GRID STYLE to either 111 or 110 because when using 110 Grid Style, the center of its grid is sell when you buy and buy when you sell. But for 111 and 110, the center of it is Buy when you place a buy grid, sell when you place a sell grid.

I hope you know what i mean.

Now consider the possibility with the FG COMMAND + your indicator.

You control the signal, trade and money management with command line.

There's no need to re-code complicated stuff like breakeven, trailling stop, R:R ratio, take profit etc.

All you have to do is setup FG parameters and place grid/order accordingly and through FG command only you can make it possible.

Hy @OP can you point out how to install the system in MT4?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Why your EA is so complex.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Its relative to who's using it.

Which part of it that is complex to you?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Presuming the EA is already in the MT4.

Then you have to drag and drop the EA into the chart.

Then read through the input variables. I have made the input easier to understand for users.

==========

Since the update of the MT4 platform past build 600, there is now a new directory for installing your files. Previously you would simply need to install the file into the “experts” folder which is no longer the case.

1. To install your EA / Indicator, first please open your MT4 platform and select file in the top left hand corner.

2. You will then see an option to “Open Data Folder” – Please select this. Once this has been selected, the platform will direct you to a folder named MQL4.

The location may not be directly into the Metatrader 4 folder but a different location.

3. Please then open the MQL4 folder and paste your respective EA / Indicator files into their respective folders and re-load the platform.

Hi Yousername,

It would be interesting to see if FG could be incorporated to work with the RMI Indicator.

Hi Yousername,

You are looking for the Candles before the Engulfing or Inside Candle to be the Opposite Colour.

The best place for a setup to occur is around Whole and Half Numbers but this is not essential.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
yes it's a 2 candlestick formation.

Harami, Dark cloud, Piercing pattern, Engulfing

Basically the system looks for either one of the two candlestick formation patterns and the pattern should appear when RMI is overbought/oversold right?

Mate I figure out scenario to use grid 111 & 110 care to share your experience when you use grid 101

E.g. 111 can be use on key levels S/D another e.g. 110 can be use say on daily open or pivot lines. How would you use GRID 101?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
TBH I never use 110

I use 101 when i'm in the middle of a breakout.

For instance we just had an impulse move to the upside.

Market retrace 30%.

Some where in between retrace 30% I execute 101 grid.

When I execute that 101 grid at the 50% of the 30% retracement, it will pick up all the buy limit order and hedge the sell order.

Then surely it will go up and take all the buy stop.

That's the reason why I use 101.

However you must know that the market will continue it's momentum to the upside (bullish trend continuation).

If not then, you will have smaller loses than using grid 111. Because in grid 111 all orders are losers therefore bigger loser than 101 if the market continue go south.

Grid 111, I use it when a breakout about to start. Or during high impact news. It will execute all the buy stop order when the market spiked to the upside. vice versa.

--- 帖子 #541 ---

110 and 101 are totally different style.

in 101 the top and bottom are either buy/sell. Both are the same

in 110 the top is buy, bottom is sell, middle is buy/sell depends on what you clicked (buy/sell button)

vice versa

in 110 regardless you buy/sell, the top and bottom are the same (BUY STOP and SELL STOP). the only different is the center, switch from buy to sell vice versa.

Here is TraillingStop (TS) logic

Let say the TS setup is the following

Trailling = 50

Trailling SL = 20

Let say the market went up 200 pips therefore it trails 4 times increase or 200/50 =4

0) Grid opened for the first time

Profit = 0pip

SL = No SL or will use the R:R Ratio SL

1)

Profit = 50pip

SL = 0pip (breakeven)

2)

Profit = 100pip

SL = 20 pip profit

3)

Profit =150pip

SL = 40 pip profit

4)

Profit = 200pip

SL = 60 pip profit

So when you are at the 200 pips profit and market turned sideway or reverse, your SL will stay fix at 60 pip profit.

Logic same applies to when you use TS based on currency amount

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Correction to the logic scenario

0) Grid opened for the first time

Profit = 0pip

SL = No SL or will use the R:R Ratio SL

1)

Profit = 50pip

SL = 20pip

2)

Profit = 100pip

SL = 40 pip profit

3)

Profit =150pip

SL = 60 pip profit

4)

Profit = 200pip

SL = 80 pip profit

80:200 is same as 20:50
R:R = 1:2.5

FLEXY GRID 1.9.5

We're almost Version 2.0

TRAILLINGSTOP is ready for testing now. I have not tested on my end as I'm about to drive out. But theoretically it should work

I will make a FLEXY GRID video about commands more after I got back home.

Question on RR ratio. Say we set grid and along the way close manually some of the grid entry with the grid EA still running. Will the EA FG recalculate the remaining entry (magic number and follow the RR ratio)

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Yes it will recalculate it.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Nice I just got ROBIN lol while awaiting the real FG_COMMAND ROBIN

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Username, I really like the way the EA is trading, would it be possible to add a kind of multiplier where we can change the size of the orders? For example: e are trading now 0,01 the next order will be 0,02 (multi 2) after x pips. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I forgot to say that make sure the Trailling is higher the than Trailling SL

Here's an example when Trailling SL is higher than Trailling 40:20

0)

profit = 20 pip

sl = no sl

1)

profit = 20 pip

sl = 40 pip.

When you reached 20 pip, your grid will be closed because it's X=<40 (lest than or equal 40).

So make sure it's lower than the trailling or lower than 1

40:20 = 2 or 2:1 (WRONG)

20:40=0.5 or 1:2 (CORRECT)

Above are just an example.... You can set it to what ever you like as long as it is below than 1

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I have planned that already.

I will use FG Command for it

I'm about to do that soon.

Having issue with the R:R Ratio after it updates.

FG doesn't remember the RR setting when changing time frame

So I must implement the same methodology as the buttons memory issue we had when the MT4 rebooted or reload a template.

This will take long.

Thank you for your patience.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #573 ---
We have so like 2 or 5 bugs lol.

I need to resolve them first.

This is still beta test.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Fuck it, I will skip R:R Ratio config issue later.

I will continue do other stuff.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I think I misunderstood your question...

Anyway

In order to run the EA faster in the backtest.... delete the OBJECTS by going to CTRL+B and delete all when running the backtest.

Open less grid does help also

--- 帖子 #576 ---
yes, this is exactly what I meant. Reduce the Grid to the minimum needed let the tester run faster in backtest...

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I will not implement this until I have solved the FG issue with remembering the last config values when MT4 got rebooted/change template/change time frame.

So this will take time. Probably couple of days.

However if you found a bug, please let me know immediately. Thanks! God bless

--- 帖子 #578 ---
thanks for your time! Increasing lots should help to exit faster the trades. My idea was to trade volatile pairs just for a couple of hours per day during trendy hours. This was my first thought, when I saw the EA. If it doesnt work, Ill test more possibilities.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
no problem mate. You right the volatile market is a great situation for using Grid and big lot.

I've been doing that too many time and got too much money any lady can spend.

Right now i'm coding CUSTOM GRID and CUSTOM LOT STYLE.

Thanks for the file mate.

I notice your take profit is too far for 0.01 lot except in a volatile market.

When I trade 1 Lot, my TP is 1000 or 500.

There fore if 0.01 lot = 1000/100 = 10

or you can also use 5

But I also see your Breakeven is set to 10 and you turned it on.

Let say you set the breakeven from the beginning of the grid was opened.

You won't be able to reach your 20TP.

I hope you use it when your grid has reached $15 or $18 profit.

No problem mate

I reckon you're going to long according to the rule book...?

Well seems you have open buy grid already

Btw if you have X11 buy grid style that mean you won't have a BUY STOP but a BUY ORDER and BUY LIMIT order.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
That's correct I only add Trades if Price goes against my initial entry point.

I add Limit Orders at every 20 pips.

This is as per Cubbybgood's rules.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
After watching this video again.

I realize another error with the middle part of the sell grid style.

If you have value 1 it should be equal to sell and 0 = buy.

In the video it executed X11

The middle was a buy and the bottom is sell stop which was wrong because the middle should be a sell order...

So here's a fix. I apologize.

If you want to apply this new fix, I think it's better you save the previous setting into a .SET file.

And then attach the new EA and apply the .SET file you previously saved

Thanks

You need to use a FG Command if you want to change it.

FG_RRR_MONEY/PIPS_RISK_REWARD

for example

FG_RRR_MONEY_5000_10000 (1:2 RR Ratio in account currency)

or

FG_RRR_PIPS_500_100 (5:1 RR Ratio in pips)

FYI you can only change the EA Properties (F7) on the first time you attached the EA.

Alternatively you can also execute FG_RESET. Once you see the pop up, click F7, set your setting and click ok.

Fromm all I saying above there are 3 ways. Up to you which you want...

I love using a trend line as a BUY/SELL signal.

Let say we have 2 Trend line forming a channel.

The top trend line is called TOP

the bottom trend line is called BOTTOM.

If both trend lines have a positive slope (ascending trend line) and the price is between the TOP and BOTTOM trend line then that mean it's bullish. FG will always place a BUY grid until it breaks below the BOTTOM trend line and it will stop placing a BUY grid.

I had this plan long before but never got implemented because I trade manually.

Example time base is mostly for session break and momentum trading (DAILY OPEN) (Tokyo / Frankfurt / London / NY) (oil inventories / NFP / ISM / CPI / PPI / ECB / FOMC / RATE) the time base horizontal line if not trigger both which is unlikely, then user can delete it manually. As for trend line I am using TL alert file attached.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
About this I will make a code to a HORIZONTAL LINE

NAME_grid style_B/S_PIPS_YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM_YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM

Grid style = 111 or any other combination
B/s = buy or sell
PIPS = triggered after X pips over the line
YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM = will be online after that particular time
YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM = expiration

--- 帖子 #656 ---
yeah great idea.

I have had the USE LINES feature because I trade grid before breakout happened just like it did with the EURUSD spiked recently.

Yeah maybe I will add the time feature into the Horizontal line in the next iteration.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
I will also add

FG_NEWS_EUR or USD or AUD or CNY_HIGH or MEDIUM or LOW
i.e. FG_NEWS_USD_HIGH

FG_NEWS_ALL

then it will print out all/certain news into the EXPERT's Journal.

Then it will be emailed to client.

In the next update there won't be any AUTOSAVE for EXPAND INFO and EXPAND CALENDAR.

By default when ever you reset the MT4 or change TF you will see those 2 texts (EXPAND CALENDAR and EXPAND INFO)

That mean you have to click it in order to open respective menu.

I don't think it's not critical to trading to have the AUTOSAVE feature into these info text menu and calendar.

Hi,
Good work on FG, we thank you for all!
I was wondering if you have the time to take a look on a new project.

It's about Partial Target money management style.
(it can be added to or work together with the FG, as a diversification strategy)

I used this a lot in my trading over the years but I always encountered the same problem
about managing the scheme over the night and over my job or holiday time. So a trading Expert it would be mostly welcomed...

--- 帖子 #671 ---
This is like grid profit taking.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Doest it have the partial profit taking feature?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Probably I will make GRID TRADING MODE on/off

so trader can place multiple order when it's off using the horizontal lines.

Let say you place 5 horizontal lines at the same price with different profit target and stop loss to each horizontal line. It will open 5 orders with different PT and SL.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Probably I will do this instead

Horizontal name_execute multiple single order_n1_n2_pt1,ptn_sl1,sln

n1=buy/sell (b/s)
n2=how many orders
pt1...ptn=is the Profit Target. If n2 is set to 5 then there should be 5 PT
sl1...sln=iis the Stop loss target. If n2 is set to 5 then there hould be 5 SL

For example

Horizontal name_execute multiple single order_b_5_100,200,300,400,500_100,100,100,100,100

Command above will execute 5 Buy orders

with 5 TP starting from 100 ~500pips profit

SL all are set the same value to 100pips loss total is 500

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Nice, but is some other thing... my partial scheme it's about only one entry level, different targets, only one SL, RR1:2...

I guess it will take another project (no grid approach for start)

Maybe some other time... or if you still want to continue....

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Mate, no way to change the lot size in Auto modus? I´d like to test it and see the results.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Unfortunately no implementation yet because I want to focus on the manual mode first before going into full auto.

When the manual is ready we all can discus the entry and exit point.

probably I have to add additional input to the EA properties for Automatic mode.

Probably in the next release I'll add it.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
yes you right probably in the next project.

We'll use FG's framework for it except it's not grid.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Successful traders really don't depend upon robots to think and trade for them.

EAs that plan to think and trade are good for video games. I have hardly found any auto trading profitable EA so far.

Semi-Auto EA is very effective. Auto EA is needed for executing trades.

Discretion should be used for bias determination, planning and mapping out lots and positions, and managing the drawdown after the trades are executed.

It will be quite useful (what you are attempting to achieve) is to have a script to place combination of pending orders, with unrelated up and down orders, with the ability to do:

1. place a pending order at Xx pips from current price or at a user set price level (entry).

2. an expiration of the pending order after X minutes

3. ability to alter some or all of the pending orders stop loss or TP levels in pips or price level.

The SL levels also need the functionality to be offset from each other by XX_pips so that SLs do not overlap at the same price level ... they must be all at different price levels offset by at least 5 to 10 pips or more but this offset value should be via user input so that a trader could input 5 or 15 or 15 or 20 or ..... 100 as the strategy requires.

Your EA will be a big big time saver when multiple trades are on the chart and your  script will make mundane tasks very simply instead of time consuming when changing all these settings manually in MT4/5 (which is rather annoying).

Wish you all the best.

The future is not fully automatic but semi automatic where human and robot coexists and support one another.

Bright future for traders.

Fully automatic EA can't survive because the human including the institutional themselves hardly survive the market.

Any way with that said here is the latest version

1. Minimize and Expand the Info texts and calendar
2. FF Economic Calendar feature
3. NAME_grid style_B/S_PIPS_HH:MM

new horizontal code

i.e.

grid style = your grid tyle

B/ = B(buy), S(sell)

PIPS = A new trade will be opened XXX Pips after the lline got crossed

HH:MM= At that particular time the pending order is active and will opened the grid once it has reached the PIPS target.

For instance a horizontal price is placed at 0.8000

NAME_111_B_20_19:30

The grid that will be open is 111.

It will open a buy grid.

When the price crosses the horizontal at 19:30 it will place an order 20 pips when it crosses the Horizontal line.

Let say the market crossed to the upside that mean it will begin open the grid at 20PIPS + 0.8000 = 0.8020

If it crosses below then 0.8000-20 pips = 0.7980

Yousername,

Can you please explain how to place straddle trade grid combination  at 22.29:30 for the buy grid to open 4 step grid each of 10 pips  with a profit limit of 60 pips and SL 15 pips after it crosses horizontal line up 20 pips.

If price goes down at 22:29:30 and it crosses horizontal line down by 30 pips then set up 3 step sell grid each of 15 pips with a profit limit of 60 pips and SL 10 pips.

Both pending order type should be OCO ("one cancels another).

--- 帖子 #684 ---
What is 22.29:30?

--- 帖子 #685 ---
For the calendar it shows my local time for the horizontal line e.g. 19:30 do we use server time? tq

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Both are using local time because that way is more convenience.

Thanks for the question mate. Forgot to explain that.

--- 帖子 #687 ---

You can use the horizontal line for straddle.

Regarding the OCO is not available yet. I can code it just add additional flag i.e.

NAME_111_B_10_19:15_OCO  <--- you place it at 0.8060

NAME_111_S_10_19:15_OCO <--- you place it at 0.8020

When one of them is triggered the other horizontal line with OCO will be deleted.

Isn't that what you want?

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Here is the logic to the new line code.

You placed a code to the H line as the following

HORIZONTAL_111_B_5_10:00

1. Market crossed to the upside at >=10:00

2. FG Deletes the H line

3. Make a new H line +5 pips of the Horizontal line price with a new code such as "HORIZONTAL_111_B"

4. Set it invisible

5. Market executes HORIZONTAL_111_B accordingly when it crosses it.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Yes, that will be good.. Please use local time for input.

Thank you.

it's time to talk about entry and exit strategy because almost all feature have been implemented.

Here's how I take the trade in a trending market

1. Identify the trend. Presuming we are in an up trend

2. Look for the Economic calendar. If the expectation is lower than the previous result in an up trend market.

That mean the likelihood for positive news is higher...

3. Furthermore I look for a bullish engulfing candle where the wick is higher and lower than the previous candle. And the close is higher than the previous candle close/open.

4. Supporting point 3, it will be better if the volume has higher tick than the previous candle's volume.

5. Look for a buy position and use Grid style 111.

USDJPY H4

1.USD is in a downtrend.

2.Alligator jaw, teeth and lips are separated.

3.Economic calendar High imapact, CB Consumer Confidence is expectation is higher than the previous result which means it's in an over confidence mood.

Furthermore across the board, USD has been bearish.

So I expect the result will be below the expectation or same as the previous result.

4.If the bearish candle after the news released have a volume tick that is higher than the line I draw in the Volume indi. Then it indicates a bearish trend continuation.

However if the news turns out to be good (higher than expectation) and the market is able to break above the blue box. Then it's a bullish reversal.

In order to have a successful robot

First it must have good eyes or vision or lenses to capture lights. That is the first rule to create a robot or a living being. Let there be light, without light there's no vision. The light is there already just need a good pair of eyes.

By that I mean it has to be able to know a trending, sideway and correction as the data is there already.

Without good eyes it will crash to a tree or wall or fall of a cliff.

Without good eyes how can a blind robot lead a blind traders?

Correction

From FF website, the forecast is higher than previous 0.3% expectation, previous 0.2%. So that mean there's optimism in the UK.

So if the result is below than the optimistic expectation then the recent uptrend is about to die.

yyyy.mm.dd hh:mm

1. Create a horizontal line

FG_ADD TASK_due date and time_H LINE_your H line price_(Add the Horizontal codes that I shared last time)

2. Modify FG's parameter

FG_ADD TASK_due date_BREAKEVEN_0/1_size

FG_ADD TASK_due date_BUY GRID STYLE_style

first try. Actually i have 2 existing sell order before i activated the sell grid 111

--- 帖子 #715 ---
As this is a huge feature and will take so much time to complete it...

SO I guess I will release the new version with OCO (One Cancel Other) order type.

If you want to use OCO on the horizontal line. Make sure in the last command you input _OCO

example

HORIZONTAL NAME_111_S_OCO

HORIZONTAL NAME_111_S_100_13:10_OCO

Attachment 4 //Bug fixing

Fixed

Now when you place an OCO order. The other OCO orders will be deleted when one of them gets executed.

It is important to know the NEWS EXPECTATION and PREVIOUS RESULT.

If the trend is up and the expectation is lower than the previous result then that mean there's a possibility of divergence.

The news result will confirmed the divergence thus a reversal about to occurred. vice versa

If the trend is up and the expectation is lower than the previous result and the current result is higher than the expectation that mean we have a trend continuation. vice versa

If we are in a bullish correction (sideway, ABCDE pattern or any sideway move patterns) and the news expectation is higher than the previous result.

Then expect a breakout to the upside vice versa

If we are in a bullish correction (sideway, ABCDE pattern or any sideway move patterns) and the news expectation is lower than the previous result.

Then expect a breakout downward vice versa. However If the result is higher than the expectation, we should expect bullish trend continuation.

Basically it is very important to know what the expectation is in the context of the market trend....

Pay attention if the expectation is too optimistic or pessimistic.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
By too optimistic expectation I mean the market is in the uptrend but it's running out of steam...

And the economic expectation is higher than the previous result. That mean people are too optimistic about the result.

It's like the tower of Babel. When people are too optimistic and the tower gets too high (people gets tired to go up the tower carrying brick and mortar) then the tower will fall.

Pessimistic expectation is similar as above except it's in a downtrend and the result is lower than the previous result. However the result is higher than expected which lead to bullish reversal

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I  don't know what i did wrong but why it's always the default value for the settings? I change the value of the settings such as number of stop/limit on each grid, RR, and pip distance on each order when i first attach the EA. But for some reason it always uses the default value. I already uses the latest ones also i do manual trading.

How can a robot be made to learn to recognise trending or sideway or correction market? In random trading, is it possible? Can it recognise multi-year adjustments happening or about to start? Can it identify why a pair, inspite of having strong positive economic output fails to continue in the positive direction?

These questions come to my mind when we think of trading robots.

I'm using 1.957.

My trading was purely discretionary and based on having deep pip pockets (not necessarily deep dollar pockets) and working only on high daily range yielding pair of GBPJPY only.

The strategy is composed of two parts since I was not trading with stop loss.

First part was to jump into acceleration train for quick 15-20 pip journey.

Second part was risk management which required dependence on deep pip pockets to average adverse trades at every 200 pips movement .

Because of my vast experience in neutral (not directional) currency futures options trading, I will always go back to four months to find out the period's low and high

and plan risk management based on the distance between them. I will ensure +10% of the total distance is used  as equity loss stop. I will use lots and contract value as per the total dollar equity at risk.

I have given up this kind of trading as I have developed neck and back pain.

The first part required watching intensively just one pair GBPJPY for short-term acceleration of momentum (up or down) during Asian Hours by watching a matrix of eight mini-charts (subsequently mini Linear charts) in sub-windows as per this picture. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...95#post9585095.

I had done research first by building database of the size of the acceleration and probable times happening through an indicator. This gave me an idea that to earn 20 pips in quick burst will not be that difficult.

Initially, I started with having a minimum of four pairs moving in same direction and then jumping into the train. 90% of the time the trades were successful.

Subsequently I developed a feel for the probable moves happening and used to jump into on the basis of even two pairs moving in same direction.

Once in a while for using two pairs for guessing momentum speed, a trade got into adverse position. I used averaging to handle it. Because of my obstinate attitude on not having SL,the consequent drawdown was putting pressure on the psyche but I did not lose even a single trade. To avoid this psychological pressure, I later stuck strictly only to minimum of 4 pairs working in same direction if I were to trade. The silver lining was I learned averaging and varying lots in managing risk as well as my psychology well. In this trade no consideration was given as to whether the market is trending, ranging or reversing.

This phase of trading was too good to be true but it did not help my health. I had to forget about it.

Later, I shifted to trading through Quantum which was based on reversal trading, martingales, and discretionary risk management. This requires EA for shooting of trades and testing of pairs which will be suitable for this kind of wild trading. Till this date I haven't found any reliable EA for quantum trading. It requires EA trading indiscriminately with the reining-in done by manual risk management including using martingales and averaging. This kind of focus on risk management also paid off for this kind of MT4 demo-trading with too good to be true returns. I am therefore keen to pursue this because I don't have to watch the screen intensly for entering into trades and just focus on managing drawdown.

I use CME futures (not retail MT4 brokers who act against the traders by widening spreads). A reliable broker has recently introduced CME currency futures on MT5 platform. So a robot of quantum trading will come handy for trading with this broker. I will go for Quantum trading any day if a reliable MT5 EA is found.

Now I am planning to use zone trading because I want to stick to the risk management methods I have practised considerably. This zone trading will require determination of direction bias and sourcing trades with high risk: reward return. It will need a lot of patience and undoubtedly a fishnet has to be designed. Esimtate of trade duration will be another component which will help remaining true to strategy until the last minute. If you can somehow put trade duration vertical lines drawn as part of FG then your EA becomes my only tool for zonal trading in combination with your Zigcharm indicator helping me in determining zones.

Hi, I wanted to say that I've been testing your EA for a few days. And I am very pleased with that. My results are good.

Only there are some things that I do not fully understand. For example, the grid does not break out. You would expect if the price goes to your advantage.

That the grid is going to expand. But this does not the case. The second thing that strikes me is that if you have the grid on auto mode. it do not open the orders immediately. Or worse, that the system closes the orders again. All things you should not have if you want to take this system completely Serious.

Let me tell you how I handle it. I start the EA together with an order manager. (Multi order for hedging) and (Ronz stoplost system for the trailing stop) It works very well, I have not seen any bad results yet. But it would be a good improvement if the grid automatishe expand and does not close the orders again (on auto mode), or has this been done for a reason?

--- 帖子 #729 ---
If the "That the grid is going to expand. But this does not the case" then there won't be any order gets executed right??

Quantum trading can be used for EA robot and risk management has to be done manually. Semi-auto way.

I am attaching Quantum trading EA for your reference. Your EA has already laid a good structure for this kind of auto trading. Quantum needs efficient risk management and

constant lots only will provide stable results. Piling up multiple lots will blow up the account if the trend will run for consecutive 5-10 days but in short term will provide stupendous profits.

Hi yousername,

I have divided the 120 days duration in 3 parts roughly for determinig time zone.

Price zone will be around 800 pips for the 120 days.

I have provided the trading way and logic. May be you can build an auto robot for trading based on the logic .

However, risk management is purely arbitrary and I can't really explain the process. It is simply reactive type and not pre-planned.

I am not technology-orinted and now will try to understand use of custom grids with considerable time devoted to it. It will be worth it.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
The attached picture will impart more clarity on probable trading zone (measured in high-low pips)

--- 帖子 #735 ---
How do you determine it will go down based on your indi?

--- 帖子 #736 ---
hi yousername,

I think I should have marked arrows on both sides to make it more clear. I have not indicated down move.

I just marked the zone size which , as per my years of neutral options trading, should probably witness range trading (except when the pair is undergoing multi-year adjustments) during the next 45 days.

In options trading, I am a seller and I collect premium betting on mean-reversion of EU which means EU will do range trading and on the expiry date of options trade I retain all or part of the premium income.

In spot fx, I will be exploring ways to capitalise on my knowledge of the EU behaviour. Risk management is a lot easier for EU and averaging will be my main tool for adverse trades. In this pair, the gains  will be limited. The best part will be I can do this trade through email/push notifications.

I will first start with Murrey Math strategy in combination with news trading (acting as trigger) and do range-trading within the space of 800 pips.The discretionary part will be determining direction bias based mostly on fundamentals and occasionally on technicals.

You PMed me about Mastermind's and his quantum strategy.
https://www.forexfactory.com/masterrmind

With all due respect....

Frankly I don't like Mastermind's trading system. His TE return is so minuscule while his trading system is too complicated.

It tells me he doesn't have any confident on his system...

I don't think it's worthy to be implemented and I don't want to waste my time on it.

I my self earned million of dollars per week with >10k lot simply using zigcharm and grid trading(1 to 10 lot)

Professional trading experience can be acquired the hard way only and by having patience and persisting with your own strategies.

So it is better to stick to just one or two setups one is comfortable with.

Your focus on news trading will pay off if you will persist with it.

Dear yousername currently the expand info & calendar becomes invisible when change TF is it possible to have like the one click trading when we press it open  the drop down. Also currently to check profit we have to change TF and then open expand info to get the updated Profit & loss which the previous version without the expand it is live P&L

Hi yousername, I am new to trading and still trying to understand the basics. I have joined FF yesterday because of you. I just finished reading all 37 pages of your thread. There is a lot I still need to do in order to catch up. The good thing is that while I was going through your threads, I've picked up some trading ideas and skills, improving my trading abilities.

There's no words to describe the work you doing, I don't even know how you do it. It's simple amazing. Since I am new bee, I doubt I'll be much help to you besides testing your EA. I hope you still allow people to help test your FLEXY GRID_1.958_BETA EA.

No problem man. I'm not promising any one to be wealthy or what.

It's all depend on you to pull the trigger.

It's not just the platform you providing for free, It's also your time, your dedication and generosity. Since I'm new, your system seems too good to be true. But based on the comments from others "too good to be true does not apply to FLEXY GRID". So...let the testing begins!

--- 帖子 #749 ---
hi. what setting do you use for your ea?

--- 帖子 #750 ---
I don't use this ea automatically so I don't have any recommendations.

I use it for manual trading and sometimes I use its money management logic to take care of my grid when I'm not around and the shit hits the fan.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
That's the plan. Hahaha let see

That would be awesome!

I just had an Autochartist Webinar for an hour and a half and I was impressed. Then I was wondering if it would be possible to also include it as part of the decision making. In the coding part I don't know how it could be implemented. It can be used with the news release to determine the price movement. It's just a thought.

In the mean time I am busy playing catch up with the FG using the guidelines you and the other members provided. It's my first time doing this, so I am excited

Hi yousername,

Could you please advise how to set up through horizontal lines  two thick lines - one line for TP (for buy)/SL (for sell) above the current market or any other target entry price and another line below it for TP (for sell)/SL (for buy)  based on user's selected risk reward to be moved by drag and drop to print pending orders?

The idea is to set up a fishing net  on target entry price closer to resistance or support zones.  Picture is attached.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
1. Set the horizontal line position.

2. Once you have set the position, you should rename your horizontal line by adding _111_B_OCO or_111_S_OCO to the respective horizontals name.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
your first time doing what exactly?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
So here's the logic of the NEWS feature

It retrieves FF Calendar XML file once a week and parse it accordingly.

It doesn't have the ACTUAL data.
http://www.forexfactory.com/ff_calendar_thisweek.xml

Java come to the rescue to retrieve the ACTUAL data by web crawling FF's calendar website.

I programmed the web crawler to retrieve the data that I want and write it into a file.

Then FG merged the FF XML with the file that contains the ACTUAL data and display it to the screen accordingly.

Let's hope FF doesn't modify or redesign their website layout because if so, I have to re-programme the web crawler.

Hi Username, thank you for your response, I'm currently testing the grid on a vps. And the issues I mentioned earlier have not happened anymore. I have set up 3 grids and on the 1st I have hedge system linked with an order manager and the 2nd only in automated mode.
And I have to admit that your system is functioning properly on automated modes.
I'm going to this test for two weeks and I will come back with feedback.
Your system with my ordermanament and your system clean on automatic modes.

What really is a problem is that the hedge orders do not open in the way described.
I expected that any buy order that goes negative it opens a sell order. And this is not the case.
This is certainly a very interesting one. This can reduce the risk and thus provide a higher level of profitability.

today I have a profit of 99 euros with your system and my order management , and with automatic mode 19. - I'm so very pleased with it! If I can help you with anything, I would like to see the possibilities. For example, the extensive testing. Greetings

I presume you talk about GRID STYLE?

When you buy grid

1 = buy

0 = sell

When you sell grid

1= sell

0 = buy grid

That mean when you buy grid using grid style 111

Buy stop | Buy | Buy Limit

When you sell it becomes

Sell Limit | Sell | Sell Stop

If I'm not mistaken I think for Automatic mode I have not updated the grid style code.... So you will stick with 1 grid style 101.

Sorry for the late reply. I had no internet connection.

It is my first time testing an EA. I am new in trading.

I see I missed a lot. I have a lot of catching up to do...

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Hi yousername, I followed your instruction on post 755. I installed the latest java (version 1.8.0_144), that's what my CMD show. I inserted the javaGetActualEconomicData on MQL4/scripts. I have unzip Java Economic Calendar on MQL4/Files. So inside folder File I have a folder Lib and outside the folder Lib, I have Java Economic Calendear.

When I ran javaGetActualEconomicData it did the same as okshop but then file FG-ffcal_week_this appeared on folder Files. My FF Calendar does not go to the latest news like yours on your video.

Is there anything I did wrong on my above description?

I am using Automatic on FG since I have not developed any trading skills yet.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Hi yousername,

Idea for EA providing signal to open grid trading.

After testing your EA, I feel signal for volatility spike can reliably be captured for triggering grid trading by combining volume and alignment of direction of four currency pairs in seconds timeframe. Or just by capturing alignment of the direction of XX pairs in same direction will be sufficient to trigger the signal to open the grid order. Some control will be needed to regulate alerts interval.

MT5 can provide reliable volume of currency futures as CME has allowed this MT5 platform use for trading of currency futures. A reliable US broker has started offering currency futures, including mini version, on MT5 platform. Trading of CME exchange regulated mini futures without fear of brokers trading against you is big advantage. The volumes appearing on MT5 platfrom will be of actual futures being traded.

Quick identification of pairs behaviour moving in same direction will also be facilitated by MT5 . I read somewhere that ticks history and mql-language functions for handling this data is already included in the latest MT5 versions, so any custom tick collectors are not needed for seconds bars construction.

I checked with the broker about duration of tick history and it is 3 months which I hope shoulld be good enough for the  initialisation.

Since EA will be producing signals (alerts) by push /email notification on the basis of seconds TF without requiring any bar construction or TF visualisation MT5 will be ideal.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
thanks for the idea mate.

Does the volatility spike Indi available only on the MT5 platform?

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Hi okshop, was your issue sorted and if so, how?

--- 帖子 #773 ---
My eyes were working like a Spike Indy.

I  predicted spike in volatility by watching charts in M1 (MT4 has no seconds facility) by piling up pairs (eight times using a single indy which is attached)  in a matrix form and jumping into trade when my eyes signalled that at least four pairs are lining up in same direction.

you may use this MT4 indicator for the time being to see if it's worth going for MT5 platform use  later.

I don't have mq4 file for it but I have mql for the indy which was modified to include symbol and TF inputs. This mql is attached.

Why use MT5?

If the same process is repeated through seconds TF then the signal can reward well and quickly.

It can facilitate comparing price action in  pairs in seconds TF and send signals to EA or to user by push/mail notifications  without setting up indicator for visualisation.

It can use reliable volume figures of Chicaga Mercantile Exchange currency futures.

Please keep it for future.

Yes the actual results started appearing after I restarted my PC.

How do you get it to show the latest news, without using the down button?

In your video, every time you scrolled up, it automatically went down to the latest news. How did you get it to do that?

I just harvested my first 29 bucks. Now I need to figure out how to set the trailing stop to take out the orders Automatically. I still haven't got around that yet.

Sorry I misread your message. You have to click the row result and it should lead you to the latest result when you click it.

Perhaps try this latest update of the same version...

Regarding the latest update, you don't need to run the script again.

FG will run it automatically.

Why? Because Windows will close the JAR file in certain length of time of its run time.

In the latest FG, it will run the .jar file when the file last update age is>1 minute age.

For instance whenever Windows ends the JAR which lead to the file not getting updated for certain length of time. FG will check how long has the file not yet been updated. If it has not yet been updated for more than 1 minute, FG will run the JAR again and again until you exit the MT4 or end the FG

dude man, i'm still trying to understand about your issue Unable to access the jar file which is most odd.... I suspect it's not the MT4 issue because the code is running external program which the PC refused to execute it.

Maybe can you try on another PC/Laptop please? make sure before you test there, it has java ready. "java -version"

Please could you share your "FILES" directory here so I will make a CMD command for you to execute on your PC and see if it'll work... Thanks

Also try execute this command on your CMD. Make sure you place the lib folder and jar file into c:\

1) open cmd

2) execute command cd c:\

3) execute command java -jar java_economic_calendar.jar c:\

Once you follow the step above, you should see "WORKING C:"

=====================

If above does not work, perhaps you should try install java again

For your issue try read this solution here

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/...-file/32426647

4down vote  Just came across the same problem trying to make a bad USB...
I tried to run this command in admin cmd
java -jar c:\fw\ducky\duckencode.jar -I c:\fw\ducky\HelloWorld.txt -o c:\fw\ducky\inject.bin But got this error:
Error: unable to access jarfile c:\fw\ducky\duckencode.jar Solution
1st step
Right click the jarfile in question. Click properties. Click the unblock tab in bottom right corner. The file was blocked, because it was downloaded and not created on my PC.
2nd step
In the cmd I changed the directory to where the jar file is located.
cd C:\fw\ducky\ Then I typed dir and saw the file was named duckencode.jar.jar
So in cmd I changed the original command to reference the file with .jar.jar
java -jar c:\fw\ducky\duckencode.jar.jar -I c:\fw\ducky\HelloWorld.txt -o c:\fw\ducky\inject.bin That command executed without error messages and the inject.bin I was trying to create was now located in the directory.
Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
When you see the CMD screen open and close, i think it should not be a problem.

You can cross check if the file update its date to the latest date every minute. If it gets updated then that mean the jar is running.

Hi youserrname, great ea, thanks for your hard work, you are a very generous man.  Just a quick one, the signal that is given by the ea indicators (bullish or Bearish), is meant to change if a different TF is used, is that correct? So if you flip through the TFs of a currency pair, the signal status will vary (if)... correct?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Your indi shows the looks of the candle and it's range which is cool.

How do you use this indi to your advantage or during decision making?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #797 ---
The signal is based only on the daily TF. You won't see signal change when you flip through any TF. Let me know if you got any question or idea. Cheers

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Yeah I think so too.

It looks like the latest update of FG cannot be back tested. Nothing happens when try to optimize the robot on the strategy tester, except opening and closing the cmd until the testing period finishes. It does not display results or even the graph results.

Is that how it supposed to be?

--- 帖子 #803 ---
The indicator is a mini chart with candles.

My strategy is to catch volatility spike in M1 timeframe for trading 15 m trend trending with a small pip target for a high daily range pair like GBPJPY.

I would load on GBPJPY chart, 8 times the indicator -each for different symbol to catch the momentum volatility.

For GBPJPY main chart, I would download the indy 8 times each with different symbols connected with GBP - GBPUSD, GBPEUR (mirrored), GBPAUD, GBPNZD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF, USDJPY, EURJPY and make it a matrix to detect alignment of atleast four symbols prices moving in same direction. This is purely price action.

I have loaded 8 indicators and made a matrix just for visualization for me to manually detect signal - xxxx pair symbols moving in same direction.

This kind of visualization is not needed for EA to produce signal.

The signal is produced by comparing direction of prices moving in M1 timeframe on chosen symbols The input for choosing symbols should be provided. If four or more symbols are confirmed moving in same direction (say Buy/sell) then EA set up on GBPJPY chart should set up buy/sell grid with TP of 15 or xxx pips and SL of xxx pips.

Filters should not be provided except for controlling frequency of signals.

If you can compare prices moving in seconds timeframe, (which I am told MT5 can facilitate) it will be excellent.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Instead of EA providing inputs for selection of symbols to compare and TF, an indicator could be made for this inputting job and loaded on the pair chart to be traded (in my example it would be GBPJPY) and signal produced by this indicator by way of alert should drive the EA.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Sorry, I mean will it be possible for FG to execute an order based on the FF Calendar news?

But that might be impossible because it means that FG must be attached to all Pairs for it to execute an order based on FF Calendar news

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Automatically it won't be able to do in the short term.

Perhaps by next month you will be able to execute a grid using a new FG command.

For instance you will be able to tell FG to execute a grid when a particular news result is > or >= than the actual and previous result.

For now i'm trying to get most data out off FF to be displayed on the monitor.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
For instance if you trade EURUSD, it's possible to automate FG to use news that is related to EUR and USD.

If it's EURJPY, then FG will use news that is related to EUR and JPY.

basically split the instrument name into 2 currencies (EURUSD = EUR and USD) and find available calendar about those 2 currencies.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Ok that would be super awesome!

There's something I still need to do and I need to go back to the thread and find something that you wrote about making trading decision based on the FF calender. Looking at the estimated impact and the previous impact. I remember reading something like that.

The first time I just read the whole thread without using mt4, so now I need to try some of the strategies that were provided. Some of the guys even provided an indicator to help with making the decision. Still have a lot to do, to improve my trading skills. I may need your help every now and then...

You also mentioned that you made a lot of money in trading, what strategies did you use, if you don't mind sharing?

--- 帖子 #809 ---
I use news before pulling the trigger.

I also use my own custom indicator zigcharm in order to know the trend, divergence/hidden divergence, pullback, breakout, Elliot wave.

I also use volume with candle stick patterns 2 or 3 candlestick formations.

Yes when you change it  from the Expert Property, it won't be reflected onto FG.

You have to use FG command.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
There was a known problem when using FG in the MT4.

Whenever you click a button in the chart, it doesn't reflect the changes to the Expert property.

This issue has been posted in this thread. You have to look for it.

Because of that whenever you restart the MT4/change template, the property will revert back to default.

FG command solved that, it has its own way to remember the settings or in other word it has autosave feature.

So when ever to change setting, FG will autosave it immediately. That mean you don't have to worry losing your EA setting when your VPS/PC got rebooted or shutdown. This is a common issue to many EAs. It lost its setting when the VPS got rebooted.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Correct. The issue was with merging the file.

The raw files are correct.

Thanks for the question

--- 帖子 #830 ---
My first feedback with the EA, some bug trading the DAX, see pic below, first i open a buy GRID but EA open a sell position which i closed, i open a new buy grid with the button and not the FG_ because DAX is too fast and as you can see EA open different size lot.

When i closed the Grid with closed button EA open new sell grid as well, my broker is activtrades and it is the DAX cash index.

Hope this could help

--- 帖子 #831 ---
I have also small issue with calendar,latest version which does not update "actual", lib and java_economic_calendar.jar are in files folder

Also i did one sell grid with EU without issue and i got an issue buying UJ EA open a sell grid.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
can you tell me your broker please? So i can test it.

My MT4s don't have DAX and I don't trade DAX

YES I had the same issue before. the file folder problem is I extract from zip in the file folder. To solved this u need to clear yr file folder in mt4. When you download zip file to your pc/laptop u need to double click the folder do not extract. Then just copy the 2 folder to yr mt4 file folder and refresh.

Already a new version since this morning  ok i download the new one, my broker is activtrades and it is GER30 cash index and not gersept17 which they also have

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Thanks i will try this, i already extract on another folder on my vps and copy but did not clean the file folder, will do asap

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Please dont extract I had the same nightmare when I extract. When extract it tends to create a new directory which create a path problem. After you download to your pc the zip folder just double click the zip file & copy the 2 file. Then copy and paste to your mt4 file folder.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
yes no problem i did not extract but just double click and copy and refresh , still no actual i will check the java version now.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
I did tried on your broker

I don't see any problem when using FG on FOREX market.

Also when placing the grid, there's always ORDER SEND ERROR 130 and only happened with your broker GER30.... same issue when using UK100.

Well I think the issue is more to the broker side. Try trading with the same market on another broker and see if the problem is either with the broker or the market regulation doesn't allow to grid trade...

Thank you yousername for taking your time to test JARVIS with my broker  i don't know if you trade the GER30 already but from Frankfurt open and London open it is a as far as i know the most volatile pair so pretty good for grid trading, as you can see on my screen shot i bought this morning and 30' later price was 60 pips above, pretty usual for DAX !

Anyway i also had issue with forex USD JPY, when i click buy GRID EA SELL GRID, was on live account and now all my test on forex on demo have any issue so this could be an issue with my broker, if you are interested i could provide you some log or what you need to check (in PM).

By the way my actual trade manager have also a grid option with the difference that we cannot see pending orders and with this system no issue on DAX.

Yes you are probably right for using grid but this a UK regulate broker with the big advantage to have a negative balance protection and not only a stop out margin call and that s great for small account using high leverage, i also test the fee with other brokers like pepperstone but activtrades is the cheaper one even with higher spread but without commission, of course i m not attached to the broker and can change

Hi,

Is there anyway to make it take auto lot? Like 2% of your equity? That would be awesome!

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Regarding broker.

Do you recommend low spreads with commission or higher spreads with no commission?

Regards

--- 帖子 #910 ---
I think one of both should be fine as long you are standing at the right side lol

I use this with 1 lot and broker with leverage 1:200 and 1:100 no problem.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Autolot 2% of your equity??? Sorry I don't get it...

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Instead of fixed lot size of say 0.2 lot, it will automatically calculate the lotsize depending on your equity. So insted of fixed 0.2 it would maybe take 0.27?

This would really upgrade the profit on the long sight.

This way you don't have to change your lot size every day.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
If your equity is 1000USD, so your lot per pending order is 20LOT if you set to 2%?

I use grid style buy: X11 and sell 11X. So I have 1 market order then the rest as limit orders.

I would like a higher take profit (profit target) for the 1st trade (the market order). So if the trade goes my way, I'll end up with the expected profit.

If in case the trade goes against me, it will open up more limit orders, and I would want to get out of the trade as soon as it's in profit, so a combined profit target for all open trades (which is the way it works now).

The only add on I'll like, is to be able to set a separate profit target for only the 1st market order. Then have the usual combined profit target in case the trade goes and opens up more limit orders.

Hope I explained it better. If not, let me know, and I'll see if I can draw it

JUST a simple calculation for GRID 11X & X11  (*risk management)

--- 帖子 #926 ---
The key to an extremely successful grid is to incorporate individual stop losses and take profits for each grid level.

That being said, if you haven't coded that, this works quite well.

Made a 50% return in July (50k account). This grid has a 22% stop loss built in.

Interesting thread. Grids are aggressive so if you are going to try and run t hem, dont run them with a "minimalist" or "conservative" strategy.

Push them to the limit because if you catch the wrong side of the trend you will blow out anyway, doesnt matter how small your orders are.

You need manual intervention. For example, I didnt have the GRID in buy mode last week. That top at 1.19 was obvious.

I put it in sell mode. Now its back in buy mode, because we probably aren't dropping too much further (EURUSD).

TP is always 21 pips (from cost basis).

Also when your grid gets deep into drawdown, use your manual trading skills to snipe a high lot entry with a tight stop loss. You can recover that drawdown easier.

I personally run grids on as many uncorrelated pairs as I can.

Is this video the illustration of your grid style?

When you execute that command. That particular opened order won't be included into the take profit (groups) calculation.

If you want to include it again, simply remove the take profit level of the chart

I have been following this way of trading for GBPJPY with no loss for last 2 years. I m bound to lose at equity stop loss  if multi year adjustments happen. Luckily I did no trade during Brexit because brokers increased margin money.

Presently It works well and generates up to 40% to 60% a month of return on margin money.

The skills required are:

*Ability to have deep pip pockets (15 times of daily range pips)

*Primary Bias determination on fundamental and technical factors based on discretion.

*Exercise patience to enter trades only when minimum reward is 2. 0 times of risk of 1. On GBPJPY when I entered sell at 146. 50 I determined risk at 200 pips aiming for TP of 400+ pips.

The concept is to be a nett winner.

If I lose 50% of time in 10 trades I lose 5*200

= 1000 pips. IF I win 50%*of time in 10 trades I win 5*400 = 2000 pips. Net winner by 1000 pips. U can spot at least one trade a month of this nature. This is in addition to grid trading. Patience is vital for this trade spotting method.

*Quick judgement to trade high lots with tight stop loss  as per your suggestion to recover from drawdown stage.

*Good EA to produce  combination grid with the ability to take profit and set stop losses for different grids individually as suggested by you (which I do manually but EA can do far better job).

*Ability to estimate probable time duration of the trade. It helps in sticking to trade setup patiently.

1. News email alert X minute before released. You can set it to true from the EA Properties.

2. FG_SEARCH.

FG_SEARCH_anything you want.

This will perform Google Search.

This is convenient when you want to search for something like anything relate to forex or anyhing you want

3.FG_CALCULATE

FG_CALCULATE_(1.0943*1.618)-1.618*2.5

4. FG_URL

This will visit a url

e.g.

FG_URL_FACEBOOK.COM

it will open a Facbook page

5. FG_NEWS TRIGGER

This will open a grid when the condition has met

e.g.

FG_NEWS TRIGGER_111_SELL_USD_GDP_ACTUAL_>_PREVIOUS

Command above will open a sell grid style 111 when the USD GDP Actual data is bigger than the previous

6. Now FG doesn't rely the FOREXFACTORY XML file.

It extract all the FF ECOMONIC CALENDAR directly from their page.

You must download JEC v1.zip file and extract the content into MQL4>FILES.

Example of news email alert x minute before the news released

If you want to enable it, you have to go to the EA properties, scroll down and  set "Send email about up coming news" to true and don't forget to set the value after it to something else i.e. 5. If you set it to 5, it means 5 minutes before the news released, you will be notify.

Does the command work in this version FLEXY GRID 1.960 BETA?

--- 帖子 #934 ---
not yet. That will be added in the next iteration 1.962 i guess

--- 帖子 #935 ---
I will make 2 new command

FG_LS/LOUISETANO_on/off(0/1)_100(TP in pips)

That mean it will be in Louisetano mode where the initial trade will have TP 100.

i.e.

FG_LOUISETANO_1_50

This will make the first opened order to have a TP target.

If you want to make check if the LS mode is on simply run the following command

FG_LS STATUS/LOUISETANO_STATUS
ie.

FG_LOUISETANO STATUS

This command gives an alert about LS status

Louisetano is on, 50

The trading manager feature in FG will close the trade if the first opened order reaches the TP i.e. 50 pips profit.

But if the market touches/opened the other pending orders, FG will cancel out the 50 pips profit target for the first order. Instead it will use the group profit target calculation i.e. using RR Ratio or Profit Target as group profit target calculation.

However when you click the close button. It will close out all the orders without considering the LOUISETANO option. Basically it will override and close the order in case of an emergency.

1=On

Btw when you reset, try change time frame as well.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
lol right...

hmmm

FG_LS_-1_0

--- 帖子 #949 ---
One more additional detail...

If the pending order got triggered.

The Louisetano profit target will be multiplied by -1 therefore the value will be -X.

If you set the LS value to 50, therefore it will become -50 when the other pending order got triggered.

This will cause LS to be disabled.

It will be return back to normal non negative value when the combined profit target is reached.

--- 帖子 #950 ---

Am I missing any step or file? can't see the news.

Could not detect earlier as charts so slow. Uj & GU not deleted weird part EU deleted plus USDCAD activate 2nd order but LS TP still there.

hmmmm need some further test to confirm the issue.

If it works on chart it should work on the other.

I will test manually using FG command on the backtest.

The Java feature isn't working on my linux machine (what else is new?) - no problem,  but when I expand the Info, how do I collapse it again?

Also, since we are grid trading here, would it be posible to make the EA print the total grid $ gain/loss on the chart next to the closed trades?

Hi Yousername,

What commands can I use for creating different Stoploss as well as different TP .

Example: the chart shows two trades done

Two different SL

Two different TP

I may also have a series of different SL and TP.

Please advise how to go about it.

Thank you.

FG_RRR_PIPS/MONEY(you choose which one)_100_200

if you use PIPS that mean 100PIPS SL and 200PIPS profit combined

If you choose money that mean 100$ SL and 200$ profit combined

FG_RRR_PIPS_100_200

or

FG_RRR_MONEY_100_200

100 = is what you are willing RISK

200 = is the REWARD that you are eyeing for

that mean it is 1:2 Risk Reward Ratio

RRR = RISK REWARD RATIO

If so, you have to install JAVA into WINE

Yes, running on WINE. Installing JAVA into that has failed all over the place...

try put the jar file and lib folder to any folder

then execute the following command in the CMD

The path you input is wrong mate "path Exception".

The MQL4>FILES is not under Program Files (x86)/JFD-4/MQL4/Files.

Do you know where you put the indi in your Wine MT4? Please read FeruFx's reply Here's a and he tells you where to put the indicator/EA etc files into the MT4 with MT4 build 600 and above.
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...88#post7436588

The link above is what I was referring to MQL4/FILES

In the MT4, when you click FILE > Open Data Folder, it will lead you to the MQL4 folders

Once you got where the real MQL4>Files folder, there you should move the jar file and the files folder.

After that run the java -jar command again with the correct path.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
according to this

java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError happens because of a higher JDK during compile time and lower JDK during runtime.

Hello yousername,

Great job here, something I hope to be able to use soon. Now my question is about the FG text commands: WHY?

Why the need for this type of input? Can't all the style of grid be in the preset of the EA in a dropdown menu? The selection can be displayed on screen in the control box. Is there really a need to be changing all the time? Not for me, I would choose 1 style and then trade it, most probably after news to catch those fast moving markets.

Also, there is no user input for the Comments? It only shows ChooChoo for all trades?

And a minor thing, spelling of Trailling is only one " L " = Trailing

Hope to hear from you soon, thanks

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Lol sorry for my bad English. I will fix it it.

Why the command? So if you have your own custom Indi you can access FG's parameter by creating an object with Id that contains the command. Then FG will read and execute the command accordingly.

In addition to that it is more simple and make sense. I want it to be like SIRI or Ok Google or Cortana where you can interact using language. If I use button, the first problem is thr layout problem and everyone have different screen size from HD to 4K monitor. Furthermore more work which I don't like. I like to keep it simple. Imagine with the command, you will be like GOD Genesis 1. Also with command it's more personals like having an assistant.

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Regarding the comment, what do you expect? Lol

Choo choo train sounds funny

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
I agree maybe the comment to loooong when click show comment to see which EA is on which order lol. Maybe just FG Power (or FG blaster) of just FG

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Nothing wrong with the Comment, but I think everyone should be able to input what they need to track their trading (see picture)

For instance, I might want to input " NFP " and after 1 year, I can use TradeReport to display all trades with Comment NFP

And this will give a good way to analyze the trades

As for being like Siri or Google, we already have those things, and I have no need for a custom indicator, whatever that might do, I have no idea.

Only need for a good grid trader to control open, trail and close

I will finish reading the thread but I'm thinking you are going in a different direction, good luck sir

Latest updates on FG COMMANDS just copy from excel and paste to charts
***You can also create templates of your favorite commands

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
That's a nice idea. I will add it soon. I appreciate it

Well the command is not hard you know. It's human readable and common sense furthermore computer can understand it.

Traditionally it is the EA that call the Indi. Now you can do backward, an Indi that call the EA. That mean all you have to do is make your own custom Indi that produces buy and sell signal without to recode complicated codes I.e. trailing stop, grid style, opening a grid, closing grid etc. Basically I'm making your life easier from doing this redundant task recoding things that I mentioned above, so you as a trader just have to develop a reliable Indi that provide buy and sell signal. While FG take order from the Indi/human and managed grids

That's all.

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Also with command system I can have my own secret command that turns FG into a killing machine

If I use a buttons, my secret is exposed

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Just had a grid trade closed (3 parts) but this time none of the limit orders have been cancelled.

Version 1956.

Could it be due to moved TP manually (just in case) and I also use another EA for individual S-losses.

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
so did you mean in version 1.956 that it didn't close the pending order when you click the close button?

Perhaps try this version mate https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post10166067

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
No, it was closed by TP.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
So when it hit the TP, the pending order didn't get closed?

Hi yousername

Any chance to add commission to profit target?

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
Any chance to add commission to profit target???

Sorry What's that?

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
For each lot I pay a commission of $3.50. When I have many trades open, which is the case when I use Flexy , the commission eats away at my profit.
So it would be great if Flexy adds the commission to the total profit target.
i.e I buy 1 lot with a profit target of $100, Flexy then sets PT to $103.5. Flexy then takes 2 more trades, so I now have 3 lots open, my profit target is now $110.5.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
ohh i see, the Flexy at the moment presume there's no commission.

Sure i'll add the broker's commission to the calculation.

Thanks for letting me know that

BTW. Are you using RRR Pips or Money?

If you use PIPS that mean I have to convert the commission to pips

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
I am not using RRR, only Profit factor (money) I'm not using Stoploss

Thank you sooooo much for including it

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
New major update to the Trailing Stop

FG_TRAILINGSTOP_PIPS_X_Y

X = Trigger

Y = Stop Loss

The new stop loss will be incremented for every pip increase in the profit..

0.Presuming you executed the following command

FG_TRAILINGSTOP_PIPS_30_10

Let say you buy EURUSD at 1.12000

new SL formula = P/L - X + Y

P/L = Profit or Loss

1. Later the EURUSD become 1.12300 (you have 30 pips profit and still floating)

New SL = 30 pips profit - 30 pips trigger + 10 pips SL = 10 pips at 1.1210

2. Followed with price increase again to 1.11245 (45 pips profit)

The new SL is 45-30+10= 25 pips SL which is at 1.1225

3. Followed with price increase again to 1.11260 (60 pips profit)

The new SL is 60-30+10= 40 pips SL which is at 1.1240

Right now the price has moved 60 pips profit and the SL has trailed to 1.12400 or 40 pips profit from 1.12000

4. If the price moved down to 1.12450, the SL will stay the same at 40pips profit

Backtesting FG new logic
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Thank you for your command list. After reviewing the list I still have the following questions.
1. FG_BREAKEVEN_1_5; the 5 value mean 5 pips?
2. FG_TS_PIPS_100_200; does this mean 100 (SL) at every 200 pip increments? If 240 pips reached then SL=100 pips. If 360 pips reached then SL=100. If 450 pips reached then SL=200 pips?
3. FG_YS_50; what is YS and what is value 50?
4. FG Panel shows YS / LS=5 / 1.4; what is LS=5?. And 1.4 is probably the spread.
5. FG_RRR_pips_39_22; are these SL & TP pips accumulated pips for each open position? Example (position1 (15 pips) + pos2 (10 pips) + pos3 (5 pips) = 30 pips TP)?
6. FG_BUY GRID STYLE_AAA; this mean a signal buy order only?
7. FG_CALCULATE_(1.0943*1.618)-1.618*2.5, what does this calculate?
8. FG_LS_1_15; what is LS? Lot size?
9. “Use Lines” panel box; what does this do?
10. Can I place a trend line or horizontal line to start grid? When price penetrates line the EA starts?
11. How can I save a template of EA with all my favorite settings?
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Thank you for the long questions. I appreciate that

1. 5 means, the grid will be close when the profit is equal to $X amount. In this case the X amount is $5

2. Logic is in post 1022

3. YS = your spread, or your spread threshold. If the spread jumped >5 pips, FG won't place a grid

4. LS = Live Spread of the market

5. FG_RRR_pips_39_22 that mean RISK:RATIO is 39:22. You are willing to risk losing 39 pips to gain 22 pips. Basically, 39 is the SL, 22 is the TP

6. FG_BUY GRID STYLE_AAA this mean no trade will be placed.

FG_BUY GRID STYLE_101 means BUY STOP, SELL, BUY LIMIT

FG_SELL GRID STYLE_101 means SELL LIMIT, BUY, SELL STOP

101 (from left to right)

1=The Top part of the grid

0=The middle

A=The bottom
Inserted Video

7. FG_CALCULATE_(1.0943*1.618)-1.618*2.5 it is a calculator function
Inserted Video

8. FG_LS_1_15

That is a louisetano's trade management logic

Poast 921, go start reading from there

9. Use Lines button, it will open a grid when the price crossed over certain horizontal line that has a command in its name

10. It's in the command list.

Presuming your horizontal name is Horizontal 234234234

You want to buy with 111 grid style

therefore

Horizontal 234234234_111_B

11. You just save the template just as usual

Hi Yousername,

As you know I am Trading Ryan's Method I see he is using an additional filter in is Trading.

He only enters one Trade per candle so in extremely volatile conditions he is protected from multiple entries.

Could you include this filter, I am using version 1.956 because it meets all my needs apart from the volatility filter.

Thank you for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
in FG there is a filter that allows you to trade X grid per day.

If you set to 1, it will trade once per day.

As seen in the screenshot, isn't that what you mean?

Hi Yousername,

GBP/CAD is Traded on M30 the filter would mean if a Individual M30 Candle moves more than 20 pips, against you, only one Trade would be Triggered.

See chart below...

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Congrats on the 1% , senyum for sure.

PMed you earlier yesterday.

Just trying out your FG EA with visual backtesting to see how it works.
Noticed that when I use this parameter

"Stop grid trading after x amount grids are closed, 0 = Infinite"

by changing it to another value besides the default value "1", it will cause the visual backtesting to be extremely slow till it is not usable. On purpose or a bug?

In the latest update for FG_2

Now FG can receive custom signal.

For instance, when you apply ZigCharm into your chart and then you press CTRL+B.

You will see an object called BIAS_bla bla bla

Notice the object contains a value 1 or -1
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

As seen in the screenshot above there are 3 BIAS highlighted in blue that FG will use.

FG will sum all those signals

1+-1+-1 = -1

That mean whenever the outcome is below 0, the signal is Bearish vice versa for bullish scenario.

When the signal is 0, that equals to Neutral.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In the screenshot above notice the value I input into "Signal names (separated with dollar sign $)"

I input the Object Name that was shown on the first screenshot into FG separated with $ sign.

BIAS_MACD_medium$BIAS_CCI(20)$BIAS_KC(10,0,5)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When there's no signal provided, it was NEUTRAL.

After everything is set, you will notice the SIGNAL changed from NEUTRAL to BEARISH.

1+-1+-1 = -1 which is below 0 and that equates to BEARISH signal.

Now you can go use your Indi and provide a text object or any object into the MT4 chart with particular name and its value is either 1 or -1 or 0.

Then you plugin the object name into FG and FG will follow the signal accordingly.

You need to download the indi attached and put it into your MT4 indi folder.

Then you will be able to use the Keltner Channel music score

Notice the Tempo is set to Custom and the Custom Tempo is set to 10,0,5

10,0,5 is the setting use for Keltner Channel indi.

In the next post I will teach you guys how to code an indicator that provide the buy/sell signal which you can use to feed into FG's parameter.

I will make a youtube video for it.

Hi yousername,

Flexy Grid still works perfectly . I only use the 3 buttons to the right, BUY GRID, SELL GRID and CLOSE GRID. Would it be possible to remove or hide the other boxes to the left of the screen.  They do take up a lot of space when I have multiple charts open .

I appreciate it if you could share your trading strategy here

Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
I don't use indicators only trendlines and support/resistance and then I use your fantastic tool to open grids and take profit. So it's really hard to explain. My trading is from spending many, many hours even years watching charts. I trade both trend and reversal, so unfortunately I don't really have a fixed strategy I can share.

However I am grateful for your coding skills, you've made my manual trading style much easier to manage

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Well that's interesting. Perhaps could you help me how do you define trendlines, S/R? What's your method to draw those information?

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Thanks for your EA.

After I installed it i continui to get this error

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Could you tell me how did you get that error pop up message?

can you make sure that the java_economic_calendar.jar file is in the Files folder?

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
I don't have this java calendar.

I just installed you EA and got these error.

In your EA is there news filter? If yes I have to install that news indicator as well but which one is it?

Could you please tell me?

Thanks

Hi @yousername

You said that you trade manually with your grid EA.

How do you trade?

You buy and sell at each level or you trend grid trading (just buy or sell orders following the direction of the trend)?

But your approach could be totally different.

I'm really curious about these concept.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Hi, Yousername and team,

Hope you are all well and having a lovely day.

This is Excellent looking EA I really like it.

May ask please I think I may be doing something wrong.

I have been reading what OKShop said 110 is stop buy and stop sell

I changed it to 110 and I bought the grid on Manual and it still said buy stop and buy limit

I want it to when place a buy.... it buys but if trend goes wrong way hedges it by selling it.

If you can Point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.

Many thanks,

G-Fire.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
110 = BUY STOP & SELL STOP = if u press buy /// but if you press sell it will come out all  buy limit & sell limit.

try run FG_RESET

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Thank you very Much OKSHOP  very Much appreciated thats the one... will try that....... I have found 1.8 with it as welll and am just reading through the thread at the moment  will try as you suggested for the new one:-))

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
It's working thanks again.... reloaded a new chart sorry to bother you.

Going to love taking this for test drive live :-0)

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
Hello,

I have a couple of questions... Where can I find the source code? What is the purpose of the ShellExecuteW DLL call? Also there is something majorly wrong with the error checking when the calendar.jar is not present. It goes into an endless loop of launching browser windows and jvm. It crashed my system and I had to burn my default profile files to fix.

Grid style

BUY

111 = Buy stop, Buy, Buy Limit

101 = Buy stop, Sell, Buy Limit

000 = Sell Limit, Sell, Sell Stop

Sell

111 = Sell Limit, Sell, Sell Stop

101 = Sell Limit, Buy, Sell Stop

000 = Buy Stop, Buy, Buy Limit

From above you should see a pattern.

For buy case, 1 = Buy, 0 = Sell

For sell  case, 1 = Sell, 0 = Buy

Also notice reading from left to right, it determines the position of the order. The left is the top side, the right is the bottom side and the number in the center is the center side of the grid.

I hope you guys can see the picture.

That mean if you have grid style 010 and you click sell, you will see Buy Stop (top side), Sell (center), Buy Limit (bottom side)

I use ZigCharm indicator to tell me the market structure.

Correct I follow the direction of the trend and I don't trade that often.

My recent sell grid EU just got closed because it hit Breakeven, only earned pennies 2 pips, Mother FXXKER

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
In this video I show you how to perform backtesting FG with custom signal provided by ZigCharm indicator.

It's not the best setup, you have to find it on your own. You can also make your own signal and plug it in into FG.

Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
Thanks, but I have my own mql based library I'd like to use...I still think that the loop is flawed when the jar is missing. Is this a closed source project?

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
the jar is executed with a dll exec file and it doesn't return anything that tells the error.

So after you place the jar file, does it work now?

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
probably in the next update I will add a JAR File checking.

If the jar file is not found, FG won't run and give alert

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
Is this a closed source project? If not where do I find your source/repo?

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
Latest update

Now it has a .Jar file checking.

When the jar file not found, the EA will be removed and gives and alert about the missing jar file.

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
No repository.

Closed source project.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
I have also update the FG_2.1.ex4 so that it can run backtest. The old version 2.1 will not be able to be backtested because the EA thinks the .jar file doesn't exists although it does. Anyhow you must use the latest version attached in this reply.

In the video below I show you how to make a custom signal.

I hope after watching this video, you can make your own custom signal.

The code below is what I use in the video.

Ofcourse you can use your own indi and produce the signal into a text object as seen in the video.

a question

Grid style 110 also available in FG2.1

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Hey my man, great FG 2. But can you make a more detail video on how to extract the java calendar?

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Question: can the Horizontal type command be use on Trendline? Can I place a trendline on my chart and FG would go long grid 111 on price exceeding trendline?? Example: Trendline_111_B

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
Yes it does and it should.

No changes made on the Grid Style.

Let me know if there's a problem. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Sorry it only work on a Horizontal line. But I will consider to have it on a trend line.

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
You can compare the .txt file produced from the calendar against the FF econ and figure out which is which.

Once you got that figure out, you can use your coding skill to extract particular information from the .txt file.

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Thanks for the answer

it's right grid style 110

(Sell-stop, Buy, Buy-limit)

(Sell-limit, Sell, Buy-stop)

or am I wrong

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
110

Buy Grid = Buy Stop (1) | Buy (1) | Sell Stop (0)

Sell Grid = Sell Limit (1) | Sell (1) | Buy Limit (0)

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
Hi,

i would like to thank yousername for creating a wonderful EA. I have doubt in the latest version go FG 2.1 distance between grid is always 5 pips even if I enter 30 in the input. Is that a bug or may be I am doing something wrong? Kindly let me know how to increase the distance between orders in the grid?

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Thank you for considering to upgrade to Trend Line manual trading similar to Horizontal Line. I am surprised that nobody has requested that before.

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
is the right way

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
You have to use command in order to modify the EA parameter.

FG_GRID SPACE_30

that command will make 30 pips distance between each order

Hi Yousername,

I want to use the following two indicators and use your EA to trigger trade. How can I do it please?

First indicator:

1. I will use the 3 clicks to position my trade and assess my risk/reward by moving the lines. The click is instant trade helper because clicking first line selects the price to trade, clicking second line selects Stop Loss, third line prints TP and the RR is calculated by itself. FF coder has provided only the exe file .

2. Is it possible for your EA to convert the trade lines into pending orders? This is for medium-term trade only.

Second Indicator

1. It uses ADR volatility to show probable entry points. Can both buystop and sellstop positions be text printed and pending orders placed for Buystop and sell stop with both SL and TP on One cancels other (OCO) order type basis?

Martingale

How can I use it to ramp up positions while reducing lots at each attempt? Maximum 10 lots I will trade at any time. First trade of 10

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Thank you Username for adding Trendline feature, love FG. I been testing FG-2.12 and encountered few problems. Is it just my platform or others experienced the same.
1 FG starts with arrows showing the grid with lines. Few seconds later the arrows disappear and you lose the visual aid of start point on the chart, the grid lines remain (see picture).
2. The spread setting did not work for me. I set it (with FG command) to LS=5, but the spread was 14.7 and FG still took the trades (see picture).
3. Once the FG targets were reached it finished but did not keep the P/L results of trade. FG reset P/L to 0. I know I can count the trades manually from Acc History but it would be better if FG keep P/L from last run until restarted again.
4. I tried to drag the trades from  Acc History tab onto chart to visual see the trades, but that feature did not work while the FG was still on chart. Once I removed FG from chart then I was able to drag trades.

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
Hello Yousername,

Is there a chance that instead of value 1 or -1 or 0 FG can be adjusted to put there and "recognize " other description given from other indicators like SHORT / BUY etc. depends on indi.

I mean not every indi is giving 1, -1, 0 value.

Thanks for Your opinion.

mojepole

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
I can confirm those little bugs.

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
Sorry, you have to follow FG's standard. 1,-1 or 0.

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
1. Yeah I deliberately removed the arrow for better performance during the backtest. I can keep the arrow intact if not in backtest.

2. What instrument are you using so I can verify

3 and 4. I don't understand the issue.

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Thank you for addressing these issues username.
1. Yes please, keep arrows when not in back-test. It is important to see when FG starts trading.
2. AUDCHFH4
3. Next day when I go to see my trades and FG is finished (TP or SL reached), the P/L results are reset to zero. I don’t know if I won or lost pips when FG is finished. It would be nice if FG could keep P/L from last run until restarted again.
4. The MT4 has a feature that you can drag completed trades (from Acc History tab) onto the chart to visually see how the trades performed. This feature does not work while the FG is still on chart, (it worked before). Once I removed FG from chart then I was able to drag trades.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
There is a very handy indi to show your trades (open & closed): these arrows also disappear when FG is running.

Hello guys, first sorry my english...

I'd like to know if someone could make a Script or EA to Open & Close: Open_BuyLimit and Open_SellLimit
on the fibonacci retracement levels Drawed Manually in the chart. The strategy it's
based on Scalping with fibonacci retracement, so to get few pips.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The retracement levels used will be: 100.0%, 61.8%, 50.0%, 38.2% and 23.6%.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed lot size
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rules for Open & Close Open_BuyLimit (2 orders):

1º Order:
- Open_BuyLimit it's executed when the price touch the 50.0% level;
- and is Closed when the price touch the 38.2% or 23.6% level; (configurable in pips too)

* if this 1º order Close in Protit on the 38.2%, or 23.6% level, the 2º order in 61.8 level must be automatically desatived.

2º Order:
- Open_BuyLimit it's executed when the price touch the 61.8%;
- and is Closed when the price touch the 38.2% or 23.6% level; (configurable in pips too)

The Stop Loss for two orders it's the 100.0% level. (configurable in pips too)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Rules for Open & Close Open_SellLimit (2 orders):

1º Order:
- Open_SellLimit it's executed when the price touch the 50.0% level;
- and is Closed when the price touch the 38.2% or 23.6% level; (configurable in pips too)

* if this 1º order Close in Protit on the 38.2%, or 23.6% level, the 2º order in 61.8 level must be automatically desatived.

2º Order:
- Open_SellLimit it's executed when the price touch the 61.8%;
- and is Closed when the price touch the 38.2% or 23.6% level; (configurable in pips too)

The Stop Loss for two orders it's the 100.0% level. (configurable in pips too)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The Open_BuyLimit and Open_SellLimit orders, don't be must executed more one time if the price touch
the 50.0% and 61.8 levels again.

* Once time the 50.0% and 61.8 levels are executed, they must turn inactive, until a new fibonacci
retracement be drawned manually.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If someone make this, I'll be Very Grateful!!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exemple:
Open_BuyLimit

and
Open_SellLimit

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Hi Username. I been learning your FG since Sept. 2, 2017 and I reviewed all 57 pages of blog several times. I started to demo trade about 1 month ago and I have doubled my demo account from 4k to 10k, in spite of many mistakes I have made along the way. I have never experienced this type of success and I have tried literally hundreds of Ind, EA’s & systems. This is a great EA when properly applied. Before I dare to go live I must learn few more items (see questions) and I would also like the creator of FG to implement my wish list items.
Questions:
1. Slippage (pips) = 50, how exactly does this work?
2. When failing placing an order, how many or... = 100, What does this mean & how exactly does this work?
3. Time out (in ms) per retry = 10, What does this mean & how exactly does this work?
4. When I use (FG_YS_100) FG command it does not change the (LS=5). How do you change (LS=5)?
5. My (LS=5) did not work. During a news event the spread went well past 5 pips and FG continued to make trades. Can someone confirm this problem?
6. Grid style 1A1 (FG_BUY GRID STYLE_1A1), does the letter “A” still used and means no trade?
Wish list (important improvements to have):
1. FG needs at least one arrow on chart to identify when EA started first trade. When I go back to check on my trades, I can’t tell when the EA started to trade. It’s like starting a race but you don’t mark the starting line.
2. FG reports Profit= 13.50 USD / 15 pips during running of EA. Once EA is finished the profit resets to 0. When I come back in morning and my FG is finished, I don’t know the Profit or Loss because it was reset to 0. Can you program for Profit or Loss to remain on Panel until FG is restarted again.
3. I set FG for grid style 111 for total of 2x 15 = 30 trades (15 limit & 15 stop orders). In order for my strategy to stay profitable, sometimes I need to add extra limit orders. Can you please program a FG command so I can add extra limit orders while the EA is already running? Or a feature where the EA automatically adds additional limit orders as price continues against my direction.
Thank you Username (creator of FG) for this fantastic Grid EA.

Hi Guys! Need some help here:

1) The trade closes after hitting the first grid, i.e: grid space=2pips , the trade closes after hitting 2pips profit (take profit is set at USD 10,000, while my 2pips profit is just USD 2)

2) The forex news calendar is empty once it opens up (i did tried all the method taught on all 57 pages, by OKshop and by Yousername as well) i did drag the zip file inside the FILES folder first and then unzip it, as well as open the zip file copy those files and then paste it into the FILES folder, it didn't work for both of the method

Hi Yousername,

Thanh you for your EA !

I am trying version 2.12.

When I change grid style 111 -> 101, it seems not change as your method when I put the Sell (or Buy) button.

Did I wrong in somewhere ?

Could you please explain for me!

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
dear yousername since its already winter when you have the time request in FG to add DST feature TQ2

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Here you go bro.

Near the top EA input, you will find DST true or false.

By default it's false.

You should see a correct time now in the news.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Assuming you buy with style 111, all the order and trade will be buy.

with the same assumption as above, for style 101, the middle part of the grid will be a sell trade (opposite of buy), while the other pending order will be a buy pending order.

This goes same as sell.

1 = sell

0 = opposite of sell (buy)

000 SELL = buy stop, buy, buy limit

000 BUY = sell limit, sell, sell stop

101 SELL = sell limit, buy, sell stop

010 SELL = buy stop, sell, buy limit

010 BUY = sell limit, buy, sell stop

Hopefully you see a pattern here

1 buy = buy

0 buy = sell

1 sell = sell

0 sell = buy

(non numeric i.e. XYZABCDEF) = no trade

XX1 sell = no pending order, no order, sell stop

Hello everybody!

Sorry for my english.

I started get acquainted with FG recently. I readed whole thread twice. And I started backtesting with automatic mode yesterday. I setted first based on the example video with custom signal.

But today I changed settings as you seen. And I found a strange thing. The price fly away, but the profit is minus. If I close all with command, it will be minus too and it does not put new grids until the profit is minus(I guess).

What should I do?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
I guess something wrong. It said not enough the free margin. And if I restart the backtest, I will get the same.

Previously I tested a lot the same settings and It worked then.

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
Does the EA have an input that would allow the grid to start trading again once the grid profit target is reached?

Hi

How do you manage the grid system when a strong trend is suddenly against you without busting your account?

Do you have any idea?

In my testing I was not able to find any good solution to manage a condition like that.

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Unfortunately there's no solution to that except accept the loss.

Alternative solution is not to get too greedy (it's a cliché)

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
When the pending order get triggered and at the same time the margin is not enough, that error will show.

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
Are you talking about automatic mode?

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
hi,

1. is there any option to take profit every single grid? (cash in pip every single grid)

2. and when its reach TP , EA will make pending order again in exactly in its price level grid. so EA not make double order in that level.

becouse price is always up and down, so sometime it can make more than 4 TP before breakout

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Closing out my EURGBP long & short grids out for the week because I will not be able to manage them tomorrow. The one long trade taken on the short grid was my mistake in case you see it on the statement. Would like to have the EA automated to open a new grid as soon as the profit target is reached.

Note: EA is not closing out all the open orders when profit target is reached. I am having to close these out manually that the EA does not close. I also have a trade explorer linked for each grid.

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
Ok I will have a look.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
Thank you. Also, can you please add an input so the the EA would automatically open a grid again once the profit target is reached? It seems trading both sides of EURGBP may provide an overall profitable strategy. I will forward test it and post the results on the thread.

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
I hope it's a demo account with all that trades you could easily run into margin call.

What strategy are you following using grid (one way or both ways)?

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
I am trading 2 demo accounts. In live accounts if I were to trade this way, funds could be sent from one account to another account if one is experiencing heavy draw down. There has to be a point when a trader decides to stop trading based on a percentage of their account being down. My max risk would be 30%-35% total over both accounts while aiming for 100% + gain over both accounts.

As far as the strategy goes, I have one long grid and one short grid demo account for the EURGBP pair running at the same time. EA settings can be seen in the images a few post up from here.

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
It's an interesting approach but needs a substantial capital.

If you are doing both ways, there will be always 1 winning and 1 loosing trades at any point in time.

How do you guys make money?

Really curious about this approach.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
Grid spacing and lot sizes can be adjusted relative to your account size. I want to test the limits of the current settings and dial it back from there if needed. I have my profit target set to $100 for each account grid. You can go into draw down as see above on the long grid. The market turned around and I was able to close out for a profit. Meanwhile I was taking profits on the short grid as the market was moving down with not much draw down.

Closing out the EURGBP long & short grids for the week. Not a bad 2nd week. Still have a problem with the EA not closing out all the trades when the profit target is reached.

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
Hi

As you are trading on the same pair a buy and sell grid, do you experienced a loss or a win on both grids?

Are you able to give some statistical data for:

Both grids win

Both grids loss

1 grid win and 1 grid loss (most common scenario)

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
The trade stats show on the summary (images attached above for both grids in post 1171).

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
My computer restarted last night for some reason. Once I logged back in this morning, I opened up both platforms. The EA closed out the short grid since it exceeded the profit target. I manually closed out the long grid for the week. See below for 3rd week results.

Hi, all this is Auto?

What time frame?

settings?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
I am using the EA for both long & short grids on the EUR/GBP. Time frame doesn't matter on a grid. See image for settings.

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
I found a broker that allows hedging for US customers so I opened a $10K demo account to trade the EURGBP long & short grid on one account. See results starting from 1/26/2018 - 2/8/2018. I will post updates starting next week. See below for EA settings. Had same problem above with my computer restarting in the middle of the night. Had to open the platform when I woke up. Max loss willing to incur is 30% from the initial balance before I shut it down.

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
Hi,

If your strategy is to build grid on both long and short, why not just make one dummy trade in demo account, if it reached targeted profit / drawdown then OP on the opposite in the live account. This way you can save capital by 50% on live trading.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
One could certainly do what you have said. The way that I am doing it so far has netted a positive return for each grid so I will continue to forward test it this way.

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
so you base your closing trade just by a certain drawdown of the opposite position? how do you know that it will not go deeper on the opposite position once you close the profit grid? for me this is just the same as trading naked and the EA will have no edge.

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
Good morning, I am new here.

Could anybody advice a Setup for autotarding please.

Thanks and best regards, renkotop

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
I have my profit target set for each grid (shown in the previous images). I will open a new grid when I see the EA closed out a profitable grid (rinse & repeat). I will simply stop trading the grids if the overall account falls below 30% of my initial balance otherwise I will continue to trade the grids targeting 100% or more gain in the account(s). I am risking 30% of the account to make 100% or more simply put. I am forward testing this pair to determine if there is an edge trading this way.

FXCHoice hedged acct results 2/4/18 - 2/9/18

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
It's an interesting strategy. My question is, how do you cover the gap if for example the price spikes and then you rinse the buy grid and then somehow the price stuck in the middle between buy and sell grid while the interest rate slowly increases for holding both position?

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
1. Let the EA close the grid when the profit target is reached which could take some time (most favorable outcome)

or

2. Close all trades if the initial account balance exceeds negative 30% and stop trading this strategy (simply didn't work)

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
Hi

How are you using the EA on your hedge account?

are you placing sell/buy at the same time and then 1 trade will reach TP and other is managed by EA to be closed in profit? Is this how are you playing?

Please explain.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
1. Open a long & short grid at the beginning of the week (Sunday).

2. EA will close out the winning grid when the profit target is reached (note: EA setup for each grid). Keep opening new grids when this happens.

3. Decide to close out grids at the end of the week if the net profit exceeds the losses or carry over grid trades to the next week if open losses exceeds closed profits.

4. Keep testing this way until account reaches 100% return or -30% loss of initial starting balance.

Note: It would be nice to have the EA automatically open a new grid when the profit target is reached. Can someone please modify the EA and add this as an input?

--- 帖子 #1190 ---
I opened the hedge acct with $10K on 1/26/18. Attached are the stats through 2/16/18. I did have some computer issues as previously stated.

--- 帖子 #1191 ---
As you have an hedge account wouldn't be easy to manage the buy/sell grids together?

For example set a total profit or a total loss of the buy/sell grids.

Let say:

total profit: 300$

Total loss: 100$

the 2 grids will be running on the same hedged account until total profit/loss is reached.

What do you think about this approach?

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
You can certainly test it and post your results. I am going to stick with my current strategy to see if it plays out to my expectations based on current performance.

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
I completely agree. This is a very important function for E.A.

Please do it.

Hi gridfxtrader

I'm new in FF and I'm following your work with 2 grids buy and sell.

If I understand, when a grid is winning, currently you re-open the grid manually ?

You need be in front of your computer permanently ?

So I agree with you an automatic re-open by the EA.

I think that yousername is able to do that easily.

Thanks for him.

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
I reopen a new grid after the grid profit target is reached. I don't have a set schedule for checking the grids (usually in the evenings - CST). Automatic reentry would be a great feature to have. Other members have said the same thing so hopefully the thread creator will add it.

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Yes but in automatic there is a re-open function with Grid limit per day=0 (infinite)

no in manual

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
I saw that in the inputs, but thought that it was related to the grid trading with horizontal line crossing set to true. What you stated I set to 0 to see if the EA will automatically reopen. Not sure if the EA knows if it is a buy or sell grid and don't see where that can be selected.

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
Hi gridfxtrader

I tried your method with 2 charts and 2 EA (one buy only and one sell only)

but if you have a winning on a chart you have a loss on another !!! if R/R is the same

Could you explain again your system ?

Thx.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
That is most certainly the case or you can have both grids losing at the same time (see below). You simply have to let it play out. Open a new grid when the take profit is reached and keep doing this (rinse & repeat). Either your account is going to grow or you are going to reach your max drawdown (you decide what % of pain you can stand). EA settings are below and are the same for both grids with the exception of the magic number.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
Thx zoraxfx

I understand your method now.

And with that what about your tests from march 1 ?

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
@gridfxtrader - I've just found this thread, and I'm very intrigued with this strategy, and would like to thank you for your input - very encouraging.

One question though: you appear to be using V1.9; is there a reason you've stuck to this version instead of using the later versions?

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
I just happened to download that version at the time so I stuck with it. The EA has closed all the trades on my hedge account when profit target is reached unlike my 2 separate accounts were it would leave some stragglers.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
weekly results: 3/11 - 3/16

notes: Computer restarted late last night so I will be carrying over open grids through the weekend. Need to figure out how to configure windows so this doesn't happen again. Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
Set your connection in the Control Panel to 'Metered'.  This stops Windows from automatically downloading and installing updates.  You can then switch this off at the weekend and download and apply any updates that are outstanding at your convenience.

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
Friends! It is very unfortunate, however, the results of the trade gridfxtrader are accidental.

I traded on this pair, with similar settings and constantly turned on the grid when it stopped (as a automatic trading).

Result: Drawdown on the account of -28% (max. 20 orders) !!!

The grid can easily not reach the minimum profit and continue to "stretch" ..... in both directions.

Last week there was recoilless upward movement, then down .... in both directions a lot of orders were not closed .... -28% drawdown.

I just want to warn the others from delusions ... and false illusions! I hope for your understanding.

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
I am only checking the account in the morning and evening to see if I need to open any new grids so that might explain the different results. I am having some drawdown due to my computer Thursday night restarting leaving the platform shut down and the EA not running. Next week will be interesting to see if it can recover. Here's where I am at since opening the account on 1/26/18.

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
could it provide a setting for ease of testing? Because it would have many possibilities of combinations ... This would make a test pattern ...

can you make the break even auto? so we dont need to press button manually?

and if you add new buy order after it touched the break even it would be the best trend catching ea

is this means when it touched BE it will put another buy order (if we buy) ?

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
Hi yoursername,

I'm testing EA on live account. Once I close the core order, the rest orders also closed following it. Besides, I can intervene the individual order (which is not the core order). Could you might think, the core order also can be closed without bothering the rest orders?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
That's a good EA, I've been waiting for v1.8 with BBBBSSSS style so bad. ) I'm trading with:

Lot size: 0.02

4 pips space between orders

manually

RR= 35:50

But I have a big problem when it's automatically close all orders once it hits $-7.34 or overnight trade, I dont know why. Is it about expiry of grid orders?

Here is the second result, pretty positive, the 1st one is approx. +$5.00.

One more question, once automatic and start button are on, the grid will trade follow the trend? or on which criteria it bases on?

Thank you once again Yousername! and wish you guys have a nice trade.

Hi

Probably stupid question but what does "Breakeven amount in currency" means in setting?

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
I will post again since I have gone through the whole thread and have learned a lot.

1. I am testing V1.9 from post #486 - does the grid trades nicely. It's very good for less technical people as they are able to change settings on the settings window without using commands, and it reflects in the info box on the right.

It doesn't have some good functions that you developed later: a. broker commissions included in the TP; b. option to hide/show buttons and info box; c. economic calendar.

2. Then I came to conclusion to test out V1.966 BETA from post #1024 since it had a working calendar (though it shows the events 1 hour earlier than the actual local time). BUT the spread analysis doesn't work correctly on it - on V1.9 it works fine (stops from placing a grid if the spread is higher than what we defined). I didn't use later versions as the economic calendar didn't work on them.

My questions:

1. Is it possible to include broker's commissions in TP AND the show/hide option for buttons and info box on V1.9? If yes - great, if not, then:

1.1. Is it possible to fix Spread analysis, calendar timing and show/hide buttons on V1.966BETA? If yes - great, if not - still thank you for all that you have done so far!

Thank you!

Hello - I am looking to see if anyone has ever had the issue I am having with the flexygrid1.9 on MT4. I am unable to view the text in the boxes to execute trades and the information in the upper right hand corner is running into each other.

I have been attempting to resolve this issue for weeks. I have uploaded what the chart looks like when I use flexygrid hoping someone can point me in the right direction. I have even contacted my broker and they advised they don't support EA's. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I am having the same issue as FMedina posted above - the text on my flexygrid 1.9 version in MT4 box in upper right corner is overlapping so I can't read the text.

Dear Yoursername, came across your thread. Great post on the EA as I'm looking for similar one. Unfortunately, the one I'm looking for not in your EA configuration. Would it possible to include one more Sell Limit, Buy, Buy Limit EA ? Also in all the EA would it be possible to choose Buy/Sell as 1st trade. Tq for your consideration.

Screen shots of my charts and settings are attached for reference. I'd really appreciate it if someone can tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
That's pretty normal, any orders/positions placed on a currency pair will be visible on all charts open of that same pair. The EA should work as you intend it to. If you place a manual position into EURUSD for example, open 10 charts of EURUSD, your position will be visually visible on all those charts.

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Gridfxtrader, the poster above me, has been splitting his buy/sell grids on the same currency pair without any problems(look at his multiple posts with screen shots). There is obviously a way to do this this, but I am unable to come up with a solution.

this grid trading strategy is the easiest way making money, but sometimes need long time to close all with profit. but it is fair since it is not as difficult as other technique.

You're right. Currently my two grids are fighting each other. One goes up, the other goes down - one goes down, the other goes up, without reaching TP.

This strategy work like any other grid while you are staying in a range market. so you close the profitable transaction and what you dowith the losing one?

Let's say eurusd go from 1.15 to 1.12 with no significant rebound. Your sell are peofitable but you accumulated a lot of losing buy trade. How you manage that?

Hi Guys,

I have been lurking here for awhile. I'm attaching my EA, if the thread owner doesn't mind. It trades the 111 strategy automatically. It is a simplified version.

The EA will open Buy Grid and Sell Grid on same chart, and track profit for each grid. If the BuyGrid reaches it's profit target, the BuyGrid will be closed and reopened. The SellGrid will remain along with any open sell trades and vice versa. The display in the upper right hand corner isn't as fancy, as yousername presented, but it will do the job. You can also set a day of the week and time to close all trades for the given pair. There is an EquityProtection feature. so if you put in 0.30 it will close all trades, if your equity is down 30%. I'm sure there is some clean up to be done, but here it is. My contribution. It seems to be working fine for me. I put it on 28 pairs on a $10,000 demo account just to wring it out and stress my CPU. If you are going to do something crazy like that. I would attach it to one chart and let it open all the trades first and then open the next chart and so on. I did that yesterday and it took awhile. I'm just running it on 28 charts for now to see how it works and find what pairs will be more successful. At the moment, I'm not sure if I will close all trades at the end of the week or not.

Here are the inputs:

CloseAllTrades = false; <== Emergency Close all trades for the pair

UseProfitGoal = true; <== Use Profit Goal for each Grid

ProfitGoal = 5.00; <== Profit Goal is $5.00, all trades will be close for grid that is in profit once goal is met.

thank you tallcoolone but how you manage your losing trades?  you just close it?

Hee hee, not really sure yet.   Others here with EURGBP & AUDNZD pairs have been closing all their trades on Friday, and seem to be making a profit.   So, It will take some testing to come up with a strategy.  Right now i'm at break even on my demo account, but it has only been running since yesterday.   Early indications for me are that AUDUSD, CADJPY,  CHFJPY, EURUSD, GPBAUD, GPBCAD, GBPCHF, GBPJPY, GBPNZD, GPBUSD are all doing well.   So basically i'm just letting play out for now.  Letting it close profitable grids and I think I will close all trades on Friday and put history in spreadsheet.  Sort on pairs and run subtotals for each pair and see which pairs are profitable at end of the week, and keep doing that.  If you find a pair that seems to be profitable week in and week out, then that might be a go live pair.  Just my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
Thank you for your contribution. My main concern with the original EA was having to manually restart the grid after every take profit.  Your EA solves that problem. Ultimately, I want to see if the banked profits can stay ahead of floating losses. If so, you have a winner.

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
You are welcome!

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
Thanks for sharing your EA, initially it looks less complex than FG

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
Hi Kaylan, yeah it just trades the 111 strategy automatically. Hopefully should close grids and open new trades successfully. I'm using a DO WHILE loop for closing trades, so it will keep trying to close trades until all trades are closed. I never put open trade logic in a loop before, so hopefully that works, i might have hiccups on an actual real trading account, we will see. I would love to make my display in the upper right look as nice as the yousernames, I will have to look into how to make that happen, but the EA should work. So good luck!

Working fine on my platform. Already closed one grid in profit. Currently negative float, but the important thing is that the EA is working

correctly, so far.

Hi TCO

Interested to try putting the 28 pairs on one chart.

Do I need to change the magic numbers and the Max Order setting?

Anything else need to be altered?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
[quote=Kaylan;12225146]

Hi Kaylan, you can leave the Magic Number 11111 for buys and 22222 for sells.   The Pair + MagicNumber is what makes the order unique in the EA.

Hi mates!

having little trouble with fg 2.12 concerning the trade manager.

I have 1 demo and 1 real account of the same broker.

With the demo account no problem, all the profits/losses are calculated well.

With the real account, it seems that FG makes something strange and the pips  are wrong...

but the real situation is this

anyone with the same problem? Or any solution to this?

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
That's simply the way for BIG moneys ( wins or losses of course) in storng trends.

Or keeping two 111 opposites grids (one buy and one sell) and collect sometimes how someone here in this thread does.

--- 帖子 #1297 ---
Hello mates!

I've played with FG about one month and I have to say that's one of the most powerful tools i've ever discovered!

I've tryed not to bother till now, trying myself and searching if someone else had my same questions, but I found no answers.

I have some question, if someone can help me I would be very grateful

1 Often in my trading style I need to open a second grid (with the same magic number) on the same pair using lines. No problem with the first grid, but the second won't open. . I've noticed that if I try to open a new grid on the same pair where already is a grid opened, I have to change the magic number. But this is very complicate concerning the trade management, because I cannot monitor the entire trade and is difficult to calculate two different take profits cause the hedging. Is there a way to manage sl and tp of two or more grids on the same pair with different magic numbers? Or I should use an "extern" trade manager?

2 is there a way to implement a grid that has run out of orders? I mean to add orders to "continue" the grid. 4 example if my 1X0 grid didn't go as planned and i need more trading levels, I have to open a new grid or maybe with a FG command is possible to add pending orders?

Thanks a lot, and go on with this incredible tool!!!!

Hi,

I need help with a setup, I am using OANDA as my broker and they are following NFA FIFO, which means the first trade need to be close first and in order, Please see below from OANDA, Is there any way this can be done?

Thank you so much

Your trade could not be closed because you have an older trade on the same currency pair.  To comply with NFA FIFO regulations, you must first close your older trade.  Please note, continued FIFO violations may lead to your account being locked. For more information please refer to http://fxtrade.oanda.com/trade-forex...rader/faq#fifo

Hi Tallcool

This sounds a nice EA and closely related to a strategy Im working on. Is it possible to change the buystop  to buy limit, so that I can work on the counter trend?

--- 帖子 #1323 ---
Good afternoon, my name is Robson and I live in Brazil.

First of all, I would like to congratulate the friend yousername for the beautiful work.

I WANT TO LEAVE AN IDEA THAT IS WORKING

I work with the US30 asset, and that asset has a daily ADR of 400 pips. I don't want to dwell on it, but I would like a little patience from you.

On average US30 runs 400 pips a day, it attacks round numbers several times a day. Round number is like a magnet, it attracts and then it turns out, what idea have I used with EA FLEXY GRID _1.9?

I created 4 different templates using Grid Style 110, being:

WHEN PRICE IS RUNNING UP AND ATTACKS LEVEL 00

1st template) Grid of 15 pips and SELL will always be placed at the level (95) 27.395, 27.495, 27.595 with (lot 0.01) using the line in pending order (_3S).

2nd template) Grid of 15 pips and BUY will always be placed at the level (10) 27.410, 27.510, 27.610 with (lot 0.02) using the line in pending order (_3B).

WHEN PRICE IS GOING DOWN AND GOING TO LEVEL 00

3rd template) Grid of 15 pips and BUY will always be placed on the level (05) 27.305, 27.405, 27.505 with (lot 0.01) using the line in pending order (_3B).

4th template) Grid of 15 pips and SELL will always be placed at (90) 27.290, 27.390, 27.490 with (lot 0.02) using the line in pending order (_3S).

NOTE 01: I leave the GRID PROFIT TARGET with $ 100, because my goal is not to use the $ 100 profit. I use another EA (Equity Sentry) to close the trades with a gain of $ 1.00 or 10 pips.

OBS 02: Price when approaching level 00, or he returns or he passes directly.

NOTE 03: An account with leverage 1: 500 is the suggestion.

I would like friends who know how to program to test what I'm talking about first. Then you will certainly create EA Flexy Grid level 00, which can place orders at these levels, without the trouble of using pending orders, as I have been doing.

I am available for any questions.

Good Morning

From the opening of the market until now we had 5 opportunities with the idea I posted (#post 1325)

Opportunity circle 1) Attacked 27,800, would sell in 27,795 and price returned in 27,771.

Opportunity circle 2) Attacked 27,800, went straight and would fire 27,810 and win, went straight.

Opportunity circle 3) Attacked 27,900, armored 27,895 ..... passed straight and armed the cover at 27,910 and went up to 27,939.

Opportunity circle 4) Attacked 28,000, armored 27,995 and won pos returned at 27,978.

Opportunity circle 5) Attacked 28,000, went straight and would arm 28,010 and gain one more entry.

Just showing you the opportunities with that idea. I would very much like the attention of the programmers on this topic.

Grateful for the attention

Hi guys just two questions which should I use FLEXY GRID_1.9 (1).ex4 or FLEXY GRID_1.958_BETA.ex4 ?

Firstly, thanks for the work man, it makes my job much easier to manage.

Secondly, I ran into some issue with the flexy grid 1.9, it keeps opening and closing grid by every tick and I'm not sure why. I made sure to not use automatic function (Manual grid = true, Automatic trigger = false and no break even), so can I ask for a small update that only has manual option?

Hi Erebus,

On line 125,

change  "int" to "long" and compile. I think it will solve the problem even if it's only a warning.

"int" is for 32 bits , and "long" is for 64 bits allowing more precise datas, I think.

Have a good day.

iTime() returns a datetime value
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You'll have to typeCast the value returned to your desired type.

Am not sure whether time_bal is a double or an int in your code.

If it's an int edit the code this way:
Inserted Code time_Bal = (int)iTime(Symbol(),BreakTime,0)

if it's a double:
Inserted Code time_Bal = (double)iTime(Symbol(),BreakTime,0)

You can also change time_Bal to a datetime type and also go through the code and make sure changing it to datetime doesn't affect the math/algorithm in the code.

Hi Richard,

please can you help me to code an ea using news to put stop buy and stop sell orders.

for exemple when a news very important concerning EURUSD 10 Stop buy and 10 Stop sell are placed to use the impact of the news.

regards,

Ludovic

--- 帖子 #1346 ---
Thats very good to hear Richard!!

I have been using grid eas till now and like it alot, but sometimes it can be to high dd. And I think my new idea can be very profitable. To reduce the dd if the trend is getting stronger.

So my idea is:

1. Buy (0.01 lot ) and 1 sell (0.01 lot ) is open at same time (tp is adjustable)

2. Next trade open (sell goes in profit and open a new one right away with same lot (0.01) and buy (0.02 lot ) open another one. That will be 2nd level)

3. Next trade open (sell goes in profit and open a new one right away with same lot (0.01) and buy (0.03 lot) open another one. That will be 3rd level)

4. Next trade open (sell goes in profit and open a new one right away with same lot (0.01) and buy (0.04 lot) open another one. That will be 4th level)

5. Next trade open (sell goes in profit. And now here is the part i think we can reduce the DD. It open sell with higher lot let say 0.03 (adjustable) Buy open with 0.05. 5th level)

6. Next trade open (sell open a new trade with 0.04 lot and buy with 0.06)

And this will continue till the trend goes opposite direction. So now we have 6 buy and 2 sell. The trend is going up(no more trades is executed, we will only focus to get this trades in profit ) and all trades is going in profit and now we have some profit (here we can have the option to adjust the amount ) trades is in tp and closed.

7. We start from the beginning

If you can code this ea i will be very grateful!

Best regards

Henning

--- 帖子 #1347 ---
trust me , u definitely have to combine some trending inds with your existing gridding system, in order to generate consistent profit within foreseeable period of time.

trending inds like MACD ,SD,momentum , you could be one step further to ultimate greatness

Hi, i bought a technique that wins 98% of time on gold and dj30, one trade per day + recover trade if 1st is loosing, i have the complete pdf to do the thing. Could you help me to code the EA ? i have coded a version but it does not work properly.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1349 ---
Yes yes indeed. I also heard you must combine the following in exact order:

Bollinger Bands

MACD

Stochastic

RSI

AO

AC

CCI

And only when they all align, does a holy golden arrow appear on your screen directing you to ultimate greatness.

--- 帖子 #1350 ---
yes , you are such a smart guy, you know what should be done , excellent pal, normally i dont really reply heavily on so many redundant inds , i just focus on one or two like MACD + RSI, so, for those who want to earn consistent profit using grid system, i strongly suggest you guys to put in MACD and RSI into your EA, make hybrid of grid +MACD +RSI, so that you could few steps nearer to complete  perfection
