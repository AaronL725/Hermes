this system is only base on indicators along signal to enter Super Signal will give you alert can be many times(that is told you to get ready to enter) not enter right away. Signal Line will turn color when it turned, you may want to enter. however, if you want to be sure is when the line have good angle like 30 degree or more then that is strong trend. Aroon (do not change setting was 20 change to 50) how to read this is when either trend line is going down, that is another signal Moving Averages with Signal Line will give you big MACD on chart. as Stochastic enter when it turn color, make sure other indicator agree to do so. I might have final version soon! way easier (you do not have to babysit your monitor!) current final version at post # 138

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Which pairs do you use please.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
some snap shot example will be good

--- 帖子 #4 ---
screan shot without Stochastic any pair can using this system but 1 m or 5 m is better, but if for higher time frame you may using super signal with singal line. do not jump even it is good to do so.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I would like to have fee back on my system. or any improvement will be good too.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
When will we get out when we are in winning or losing Tp Sl ?? best regards

--- 帖子 #7 ---
5 m good for 10 pip but if the signal line and moving average big MACD shows could give you even 50 pip or more. since you do know the trend then you should be able to get the profit within the 30 min or so.

Hi mtuppers I am enjoying trailing your system so far. I have spent only a little while tonight trying it out and i think that I am about 3 x3 trades +90 pips all up and x1 -5 pips trade ( all on the 5 min). I am only trying it on about 4 currencies. I am also trying it in one currency on a 4 hr and so far I am about +100 pips. So I am a happy chappy at the moment. Just thought I'd add, it's like 'forex for dummies' which is probably why I am doing so well!! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I'll be trying it on the 1 Hour Charts. Happy Trading, cwave

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I didn't mean anything bad in my last post, all I meant is that it is easy to use (even for me). Ah!!!!!!!!.........I love pips!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
this system is imposible to get loss, unless you are chasing or do not following the rules.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Tuppers wich setting r u using for ma? and wts ur stop and target for 1 min tf? im backtesting ur system atm and it looks promising thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Tuppers, I am not sure what the use for the Aroon indicator is for. Are you to explain further please. I am finding that I am not using it and maybe I should. Regardless, a total of 245 pips last night, 9 +ve trades and 2 -ve, trading 4 currencies for about 2 hours. Not bad Tuppers, not bad!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Are u trading this system live ? Please post more example of ur trades so that we can understand the rules better. Thnx I have done some back test and it seems that u only need signal line and super signal to agree for a trade. The stoch is not of any use because whenever signal line and super signal both agree on the direction, stoch will always turn to the correct colour before that. As for aroon, I don't know how to read it but it doesn't seem to provide any value to the trading decision. I only look at signal line and super signal on my backtest and it seems strange enough to work very well. It will be interesting to see an EA made out of this system. Question: (1) Ur snap shot have another line on the chart , what is that ? (2) How to read the Aroon indicator ? (3) where is the big MACD ?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
i think Super Signal repaints

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Mtuppers.., your system so simple 1. How do you use super signal with signal line in the Higher Time Frame, such as 1H and 4H? is it work same way in TF 1 and 5? 2. I see MA at your Chart screen shot (white line), is that right? how is the MA setting ? please attach your template, if you dont mind. Thanks Buddy..

--- 帖子 #17 ---
hi there! can anybody help me, i am new at the forum? i cannot open the mq4 format. any ideas? 10x in advance

--- 帖子 #18 ---
"Moving Averages with Signal Line will give you big MACD on chart." what's meaning of this?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Nice results can't wait to see what this weeks does I will be testing this system alone this week.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
from anyone using this?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi mtuppers I have been having mixed results this week. I am finding that when I wait for the signal line to change it is usually to late to enter a trade. Do you have any suggestion mtuppers or can anyone else suggest when is the best time to enter a trade using this system. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #22 ---
overall, this system if you go for longer time frame, you may just using super signals. however, be caution. becuase. when alert shows, it may not ended. as for super signal to reprint. that is at that time may shows the lowerst or higherst price. however, for the big trend. as the super signal will retest if for this time frame is end the trend. that is reason why I said wait for signal line to comfirm before enter. depends on what time frame you are using. if you using 1 m chart. you can wait for super signal and singal line to confirm. have a good angle for signal line. do not enter when signal line still is like flat. "Moving Averages with Signal Line will give you big MACD on chart." what's meaning of this? what is mean is if you see not stander MACD you should see two lines. so when line cross over, is signal to enter. well, I will try to put it on video to let you guys know what is my system. for mq4 files. the file on first post put all them under expert/indicator/ Aroon indicator how to read it. it has two lines, one up trend line and the other down trend line. as indicator window form 0 to 100. when the line stay at 100 means very strong trend. however form the trend line start moving down like 70 mean other trend line is in control then trend. for easy one is which ever the line at top is loss the strenght. but when ever you see a line is not reached 100 and drop down like you see up trend line go up for 30 and drop down. this can mean there is a weak up trend. if it go more then 70 and drop down. either big down trend is coming or down trend already ended.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Answer, 1. that is Moving Average 2. when ever line is drop down form 100 then that is strong trend comming as other trend line below. 3 the big MACD is signal line with Moving Average. so when ever the signal line on top of Moving Average is signal for buy. if Moving Average on top of signal line mean sell. for Aroon indicator check this page http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aroon.asp but for me is when ever the trend line form 100 start toward 0. this one show better http://www.onlinetradingconcepts.com...sis/Aroon.html for above page red line is down trend line and greed line is up trend line. so at center of this indicator on this page shows down trend line which is red. is totally ended, and up tend line which is green is start testing the 100 the reason way I said please do not change the setting, is by defautl is 20 however, the indicator will look like the pages above. so more confusing. my setting for aroon is 50.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
for your case, I think you better using color stochastic instant. so when the color change, and start to moving either up or down. that is signal to enter. however, super signal have to agreed on that. remember this system or other forex system the rule number one is wait until every thing comfirm. anytime is good time to do trade with this system. but just need to wait until indicator confirm.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Mtuppers.. better you post your chart once after you take LONG/SHORT Position, and give spot on the chart, and explain why you take your trade! that will help a lot for newbie to learn about the simplicity of your system ..! anyone have back test..? please post

--- 帖子 #26 ---
well do that on friday on chart, please zoom in to second largest as you can see the candle sticks clearly. as for Aroon indicator as default up trend is yellow color, and down trend is doger blue. so you can see it very clear, that one of trend line when it ended, most of time give you very big profit.

add gold miner setting 5

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Can you please explain the purpose of this new indicator.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
gold minner indicator by default Deep sky blue (signal buy) Red (signal sell) change SSP to 5 (default is 7)

--- 帖子 #30 ---
here is update how to using this system. using Vertical line to draw the line when you see the Aroon indicator either up or down trend line do down. if you do draw a line. and you can see it better on all the indicators. if all agree then that is the signal to do trades. here is my indicator order 1. color stochastic 2. gold minner 3. Williams' Percent R (check at codebase.mq4.com) 4. Aroon for color stochastic, gold minner, and signal line. my up trend color is red, down trend color is blue. so uniformed the color on your indicators. if you like darw a Vertical line on chart when super signal ends to see if that is good signal to trade or not.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Opened Goldminer2, went to inputs but cant seem to change the 7 to a 5! What am I doing wrong ? Eddie

--- 帖子 #32 ---
OK - Sorted it, guess my mouse was stuck!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Out of all the systems I have looked at over the past 6 months I must say this seems to be the easiest to pick up and work with. I have already used it for short term pips this afternoon and it all seems good - 60 pips over 3 trades. I do have a few questions relating to the system and I just wanted to check that I am understanding this correctly ( and that so far isn't just a fluke !) Aroon - I get this and it is a simple way to show if things are really up or down at the time of trade. Goldminer2 - Simple way to indicate whether buy or sell is the most likely move at the time Stochastic - Now I am not sure which one we are using here or what it relates to - any help please The Chart The arrows and crosses relate to the moves but again I am unsure as to their exact significance - any help please. (I have already Googled where possible and am looking for feedback and advice from people using/improving the system) Many thanks in advance Eddie

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Mtupper or somebody else, can you help me step by step how can I download your indicators? My metatrader with FXDD broker does not support third party software,as they say. Please, tell me your broker and I open demo acc. with them. Thank you,

--- 帖子 #35 ---
You should be able to add them in: Close MT4 Got to where you istalled, usually programme files in your C: drive, MT4 - (or whatever it is called in your installation) then: Put indicators into experts/indicators Then restart MT4 You will see the new indicators in the list (got to the top - View &gt; Navigator) Hope that helps Eddie

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I will post the picture now...

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I draw the Vertical line to see if that is start trend or not see the picture below anyway basicly idea is if all indicator comfirm then that is signal to do trades.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
thanks for your system,can u attach your templates pls? thanks

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Great... always post your picture/chart to help us easier to learn. thanks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I have added in some pivot levels to give an over view. I have found these help as you get an idea of where the market is going before the other indicators kick in .

--- 帖子 #41 ---
below is template, but I did not try it. anyway. make sure you do download all the indicator and place in indicator folder. What I do find is for color stochatic if is down trend continues, more likely will not reach 100 and if up trend continues, more likely will not reach 0.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
nice system you got here i do not fully understand it yet but from what i can see it work i have taken 90 pips so far today on it and that is with not fully understand the system to it's fullest yet

--- 帖子 #43 ---
well by ending of day took 120pips on 5m going to try longer time frame anyone trading with this on longer time frames any info would be great

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Sorry people just cant seem to get my head around the aroon indicator, do i take it that whatever coloured line is at the top near 100 and dropping down is the strong trend and the one that we should pay attention too? Thanks, any help would be greatly appreciated. juls.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Aroon - read http://www.onlinetradingconcepts.com...sis/Aroon.html

--- 帖子 #46 ---
This template is not right - doesnt include even the basic super signal! Please post a full template. Also please add the "ServerUnag" indicator you have used. Many Thanks Eddie

--- 帖子 #47 ---
On the aroon indicator then if we were looking to buy we would want to see the sell colour coming from 100 down towards 70. is this correct please? many thanks juls.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
sorry, I knew that will happen. it seems like too many indicator for the template does not work at all. what I can do best is to put all indicators if in mq4 files. I can do change the setting other then that only one file is in ex4 which is goldmine 2

--- 帖子 #49 ---
yes! that is correct. that is #Market_Price1.4.mq4 below it attched zip file for all indicator that I use. if you guys fine more indicator that you like. please post on forum or pm me. thanks

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thank You

--- 帖子 #51 ---
while watching this system, on the goldminer when we are waiting for it to change colour for entry (assuming everything else lines up) all of a sudden it changes colour about 2 or 3 bars previously which then gives us late entry. Is this correct? Many thanks Juls.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Mtuppers - thanks for sharing your system, I will be doing forward testing on this system and make suggestions if I have any. Seems like an interesting system so far.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
you said this earlier:- this system is imposible to get loss, unless you are chasing or do not following the rules. can you please explain what you mean by chasing. many thanks Julian.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Chasing means. if every indicator shows almost ended the trend. and you still want to get like 20 or 30 pip in like 30 min time frame. of couse, if you can double check with longer time frame will be better. however, for longer time frame you need way more margine. I will try to post a picture to let you know why I am saying chasing as for gold miner did you change setting?

--- 帖子 #55 ---

I will try to post a picture to let you know why I am saying chasing as for gold miner did you change setting? __________________ How do we notice end of trend with your system please, what do the inicators look like for end of trend, also yes i have changed settings on goldminer to 5 makes no difference when waiting to go short. many thanks Juls.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I think pictures showing us winning trades and false trades would be a great help if you have time, for some reason when i wait for everything to line up to show entry its too late. many thanks juls.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
or if you dont have time to show charts, tell us your trades for the day on which market and what times and then i can check yours with mine, this would be a great help. just let me know the day and times of your trades for one day, please state your time though, gmt or est? many thanks juls.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
now at GMT time at 8:49 am (Friday Nov 7 2008) EUR/USD 1m chart look good for uptrend. if I enter for long may be to late for 30 pip. maybe good for 5 pip! after just check 1 m to 1 h shows, uptrend may be ended soon. 4 h stochatic shows going up. but too risky as result 5 pip is alright. came back down for 20 pip and retest the high go over the high like 30 pip I just turn on computer. Juls what time frame you are using? anyway for Juls, I think better for you just go for signal line, and color stochatic if both have good angle then that is signal to enter.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
my time frame is also gmt. please keep me posted on trades and entry so i can grasp this system. many thanks juls.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Can you post a couple of examples of a good entry line please....

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I mean which chart do you use, like 1m, 5m or 15m etc.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I mean which chart do you use, like 1m, 5m or 15m etc. __________________ i use mainly 5 min charts.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Mtuppers....would you happen to have the mq4 file for the goldminer indicator?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
No need to "I think it repaints" becuase it does and you are correct. It always looks good in the past but in real time it just keeps moving so of little use.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
that is reason super signal only can be a guide for you get ready to do trade. also need to use other indicator to help you to know when is end the trend. well don't know how many time I have say this! sorry no luck, search on google and other forex forum only the ex4 I got. I will try to find other indicator which is quite similer to gold minner okay, that is good for signal line with color stochatic. I did pm to you for msn. pm me back thanks

--- 帖子 #66 ---
anybody plz tell me how can i check these attachments?? i downlown these attachments but dun know how to check it??

--- 帖子 #67 ---
after download click on zip file. open C:\ Program fileMetaTreader...expertindicator unzip or copy all the indicator file to above folder Juls I got your email please remove on the forum otherwise you may be get a lot of spam.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
E-mail has been removed, please feel free to mail me any charts of entry or information etc. that will help me understand your system, many thanks in advance. regards, juls.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Better off putting it on here so that we can all learn....... System does work as a "heads up" that things are moving, but shouldn't be used on its own.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
sorry, I am going away for 2 days back on Thursday

--- 帖子 #71 ---
new indicator maybe replace gold minner how to use it when red bar go above 0.5 get ready for sale when blue bar go below -0.5 get ready for buy. however, using super signal and singal line to comfirm this system is not for anyone who want to jump in and do trades. as for who ever do watch NHL goaltender always know "better be safe then sorry" anyway for any sytem trades at your own risk.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I wish to thank you for your simple system, this is the first time for me to get a system i understand very easily and practice it. I think with more practice i will make good pips .I wish you could put the gold minner indicator in mt4 format,it looks a very good indicator. thks for your system. have you tried it on long tf like 1hr or 4hrs.?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Does gold miner indicator repaint?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
yes it may repaint but once stochatic and singal line do have good angle then color will stay.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
for who ever whish to go for longer time frame like 1 h or 4 h add few rules want to be sure, will be same rule and go with Moving Average with Signal Line forms MACD (you should know where the uptrend or downtrend) and Parabolic also go and same trend. Off couse do not ignor the Aroon indicator (this one will play major rule) however, make sure you have enough margine to play with even most of time will go that way, however, it may like you have to have like 100 pip or plus margine. I don't know if gold miner indicator is free or not. but... see link below see http://fxtradingreviews.com/forex-funnel-review/

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Rads MACD might replace goldminner 2 Aroon indicator change Mom Period form 50 to 20. gold minner 2 this indicator mq4 version sorry I has not test yet. I asking other people at other forum to decomplie for me. I will add other indicator later and post new chart

--- 帖子 #77 ---
If you think signal line is too slow download the HMA Modified forget about HMA Modified, even HMA is faster, however, more likely give you false signals

--- 帖子 #78 ---
stochastic cross alert might replace super signal what I find is stochastic cross alert when is show up most likey Signal Line will follow, if not, no trade as Stochastic Candle Bar over brough and sold, this one, will let you know when about to buy or sell order

--- 帖子 #79 ---
following is chart the system rule when super signal show up first, then stochastic should draw the arrow later on. so does signal line will change color. if using stochastic candle over brought or sold. you may want to wait until over brought or sold color show up. (this one you have to wait for a while to show up, work best 1m or 5m. for stochastic candle by default over brought color is red over sold color is green nomoral color is orange

--- 帖子 #80 ---
But let me say something again my fellow trader, -there are hundreds of other systems out there -almost all work well in trending markets -u will certainly find a fault with all systems BUT....... - almost all thread starters are real traders and give good advice - they think and think to produce a system...a good work indeed So...... - stick to the method u prefer -some like it simple,some complex and some are attracted to only beautifu setups(simple or complex based on the indicators involved) As 4 me.... - this thread is beautiful and good for my logic. Good pips to all.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
sorry wrong idea.

Indicator Goldminer2 actually ForexOffTrend (Formerly known as SilverTrend ) http://www.carigold.com/portal/forum...ad.php?t=60886

--- 帖子 #83 ---
greetings mtuppers I've been testing your system really gives good results in most of the times I would ask you if you can put Updated use of indicators and set the table and pls I really learned a lot with your system thanks mtuppers

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Well try to update the system Feb 10. sorry, I do not have internet access. at current location.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Am not surprised about alot of work put together here by every good people on this thread to make this system work perfectly. I have been testing this system since last since a week now on 5mins and 15 mins, its works great but only tested it on daily trades for two days and its giving me good profit on Alpari Uk and also trying it on Fxdd, it only requires patients. I formally use OZFX which i work with the indicators and Signal generator, but i just think this SSS - Super Simple System is just the ideal Forex system for me. I love it Wish you all the best, Alphizo Fx

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Interesting trading system. Has anyone created an EA for it yet? It would seem that with so few rules, an EA would work well with this sytem. I'm looking forward to trying it Sunday.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Pls, someone help me with Stochastic Colour Line EA, I really love the indicator but i want the EA for the Indicator. pls someone help me. Thank you Alphizo Fx

--- 帖子 #88 ---
man this system is realy helpful , A BIG THANK YOU ! Please try to keep posting if u have new updates .

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I'm sorry, but after reading the six pages of this thread, I am VERY CONFUSED... No offense to mtuppers, but his english is very poor and I cannot understand half his sentences. Can someone who has been having CONSISTENT success with this system, please post your template, indicators, specific TP and SL levels, Time-frame , etc... I am sure this will benefit more than just me on here THANKS! PS: I am a huge fan of super signal... I use it in my personal system daily, it is great!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Note: Super Signal only can be used as a guide!!!! sorry template tried does not work. TP veries, depends on time frame for 5 min 10 pip or so should be able to be reached. SL I don't think you need, because if you follow rules. you should be able to be profitable. okay I try my best to let you understand more. indicators Aroon, Super Signal, Stochastic Cross, Signal Line, Moving Average. steps 1. Aroon indicator When trend line start to move down form 100 that is big trend ended. 2. Super Signal and Stochastic Cross both indicator should show arrow. 3. Signal Line should start to change color. 4. Angle, you will not want to trade when angle is way more like flat. you want to trade with good angle. good angle should be more then 30 degree. 5. Moving Average with Signal Line would let you have an on chart MACD. key point is step 5. if you see very good angle, and the gap between Moving Average, and Signal Line is huge. another key point is After Aroon shows ended Color Stochastic should show change color first. then Signal Line should change color soon. Then see if there is good angle. see picture at post #79 stick with above steps you should able to understand about system better. Another better system indicator Aroon, ADX, WPR, Stochostic. rules? study above indicators. and see what is in command

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Had some thoughts, but don't want to stray from the very good basics of this system so I edited. ....Again! Thanks everyone! Keep up the great work!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
any thoughts are welcome, because there is no such things as perfect system

--- 帖子 #93 ---
MTUPPER Great program. right now i am 21 for 21 on trades. I hope i can continue the trend. I have a question about the aroon setting. Is it supposed to be 20 or 50 ? thanks lde

--- 帖子 #94 ---
[quote=lionsden;2566580]MTUPPER That's awesome lionsden! Is your chart set-up the same as mtupper. What timeframe are u trading, what is your take profit and your entering your trades at the close of the candle? Thanks for sharing your experience.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
thanks fxcash, I will attach my template for you to use. I am entering my trades based on the position on the indicators being all in line. The best indicator so far is the signal line. I use the super signals as an indicator for a possible trade coming up. The thing to remember with the signal line is that some times it flashes back to the previous state shortly if it was a weak trend. Remember to trade off of higher highs and lower lows looking for the retrace if possible. The signals are not 100% but pretty close. What gives you the edge is understanding trading as a whole. These indicators will give you the technicals but there are also fundamentals that you have to trade around. You can run into a buzz saw if you don't. Money management is key also. Not all trades are good trades. Oh yes i was using the 5M only. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #96 ---
yes Aroon suppost setting is 20, the reason I change to 50 is that as setting 20 you have to understand more. you may want to have to Aroon one setting as 20 and other 50. as for 20. more accurate in short time. but 50 give you big idea. don't forget the Signal Line, and Moving Average. this give you most accurate signal. most of time if this MACD is been formed, with good angle, that would be good signal to enter.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
new update. forget about the stochastic cross. also add WPR rule 1. after Aroon show end the trend 2. Super Signal and this new indicator should have both show arrow on chart. 3. Signal Line should already change color if not, will be soon. 4. Color stochastic and WPR should go same direction. 5. Signal Line and Moving Average should form good MACD angle maybe you might want to keep the stochastic cross alert Do not ask me who wrote sar_sto_as_stevejames_alert.mq4 becuase even I do not know

--- 帖子 #98 ---
below picture is different with Aroon setting 20 and 50 you can use 20 as your default, it will more likely work with stochastic and other indicator as current time frame. as 50 setting, is to give you the big picture

--- 帖子 #99 ---
below chart is example why I setting Aroon for 50 instand of 20 50 setting does not show uptrend is ended, but 20 show ended. note that is about before 50 setting show ended

--- 帖子 #100 ---
this salha-cross-signal replace super signal? don't know, but this indicator seems like is better then super signal. if go with sar_sto_as_stevejames_alert.mq4 then if both signal show around same time. bigtrend note sar_sto_as_stevejames_alert this indicator more likely show when Moving Average and Singal Line cross over.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi guys. Is it possible to grab 2 pips when super signals "initially" sounds by going "against" the signal and "with" the current microtrend on the 1m chart? I find that it repaints so much, that it may be feasible to do the above - untill such time that it eventually signals the actual reversal. Maybe only take the first signal that goes against the signal line color or equivalent trend indicator. So for instance, in the above scenario, price approaches upper bollinger bands from below or middle, signal line is blue (up), super signals sounds for the first time signalling down - in this up microtrend cycle - and we grab 2 pips by buying instead of selling like super signal is telling us. ...Price continues up, super sig. sound again, but we ignore untill next cycle. Many signals per day, but maybe timefiltered for more volatile periods, and 2 pip profit may come very fast with very small stoploss and almost nonexistent draw down. Right now as I write this signal for up, going against red signal line sounded for e/u at 1.2567(18:21 1m bar on FXDD - high of 1.2568 and low of 1.2562) which would have easily netted 2 pips. ...another signal for down going against signal line blue color which would easily have netted another 2 pips, ...all in a matter of minutes as I write this! 2 pips here and there I realize is not everyone's style, but if this proves to be consistent, no one will complain I'm sure! Please someone more competent than myself check this out, and maybe make a SUPER simple ea out of this. ...maybe using the repainting issue to our advantage??!!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Of course, I believe the valid signal with the yellow thumbs up below would have netted many pips. That signal actually conforms to mtupper's rules I believe. ...But notice the super signal up top from the last screenshot above to the shot below: very jumpy!; (That's why we wait for confirmation, but while we wait, maybe the hypothetical ea I eluded to in my last post can get us an extra pip or two!!!...every half hr. or so )

--- 帖子 #103 ---
...And knowing that supersignals repaints, I bought on the dip and made $40 demo bucks. Should have let it run. But till where?! That's the question at least some of us struggle with I'm sure.

There have been so many changes made, so many suggestions changed, so many indicators included and then removed that this is not any kind of a "system" but rather a "Very Difficult Experiment." Sometimes on the very same post there is "Use ....indicator" followed by "forget ...indicator." No offense to mtupper but why not do your experimenting and then present us with a system to help refine?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Personally, I wouldn't be where I am without experimentation and mtuppers, among others and one cannot predict where improvements can come from. As long as we don't talk about radically different systems in this thread I think we can only gain from each other. So no stocks, no weekly charts, ..... To my mind, we are still on track with the original "intent" (foundational system) that was started on the first post. ...Just refining and understanding it's "personality". A good example is to take the latest indicators posted by mtuppers and compare chart to chart how they actually perform compared to the previous. Two brains are better than one, and so on. The quicker we get to a consistently profitable system, the better, but it's a process that needs to be gone through nevertheless. All the best to everyone here.

Some trades since my last post: Wish I could do the same with a live acc., but invariably my concentration will lapse and I can loose a full day's trades all at once! EA anyone?? Basically a trade taken by ea on a - maybe w/trail stop when in volatile market - reversed first supersignals alert appearing during a pre-established trend, and said ss alert going against said trend or 1m microtrend. (Trade taken on first signal only, since further repainting may signal actual reversal, which we await with other confirmation per mtuppers.) Then rinse and repeat...and it may even help my less than optimal trading below ;

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Any pairs will do, concentrate on 1M TF but always compare with 5M TF, better judgement, follow the rules.. the best when the signal line changes its colour or angle 30 degrees. Very effective for scalper.. Cheers..

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Please note last trade below taken on 1m timeframe while priceaction was bouncing around in a lunatic fashion ... untill it decided to cooperate with my wishes : (Could have had much more of the move, but 2 pips was all I was after had it been a simple ea trading according to my stated strategy which I'm trying out.)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Rinse, Repeat - a few minutes after:

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Ok, seems to work: My last post for a little while since I'm hogging this thread, and it's not mine to do that with. Thanks mtuppers and everyone!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
this system work best at high time frame like 30m 1hr 4hr but also work smaller time frame. but do not expect big profit. Indicators Aroon, and Stochastic rule using Aroon to see trend ended or not if so stochastic either had cross over or going to cross over soon.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I do not using bollinger bands because it does not show too much what would it indicat what going to happend. As I said super signal only can use as a guide, you may want to enter with Aroon maybe with parabolic. for that case signal will be when parabolic shows.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thank you mtuppers for sharing with us and taking my trading to the next level! With my stubborness and lack of discipline, not there yet, but much closer!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
should I post other indicators??? or just leave this system as it?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
As a matter of what is to be used as a rule in guide for this trading system. Can you post once again your final selection of indicators and their priority for use in your trading system ? Can you also explain if the spread is important to consider given this system on the 5M chart is optimized for a 5 pip return ? Do you trade around news or completely stay on the side lines during major economic news like to day on the USD because i know you are not in favor of stoplosses? Which pair have you had the most success in ? And do you feel an EA would work with this strategy? thanks for your Help MTUPPERS. lionsden

--- 帖子 #116 ---
spread should not be a problem. as for news. I not enter before the news, only after news, see stochastic, ADX, Aroon to comfirm the trend. Like today, as ADX show tons of Buyer at 5 min chart (form marketiva platform)(DI+ at very high and DI- at 0) when you see this happend, you could enter 50% of your money in trade, becuase the trend will continue up for a while. I trade mainly EU only, others if Aroon, WPR, ADX, and Stochastic do agreed on trend will enter. For EA, that I had an idea, but I am not good for programing anyway, for EA idea is check Aroon, if end, if so, Stochastic, should cross over for same trend, exit when Stochastic cross over again. this idea is copyrighted, if who ever creat this ea, must to share, can not be sold. All new indicators are in Attched ZIP file this time new rule, sorry, I know, it has been too much new rules, but this time would give you have more free time, and you don't need to be babysit to get signals. well don't go too far... for big trend 1. check Sidus-Crossover Signal (as attch File) this one may not alert that much, but give you the major trend will show signal on main chart too. 2. check Aroon (which I seeking someone if able to do alert) 3. check Forex Trend fxfariz (if turn color) this one better then goldminner 4. Always using longer time frame Stochastic as your guide (if longer time frame Stochastic is not go that way, like 1 hour chart show uptrend not downtrend, you better enter uptrend. for small trend 1. Forex Trend fxfariz alert you. change color and trend 2. Salha_Crossover_Signal should apear on chart 3. Aroon indicator should already start pushing the trend line down. 4. exit when super Signal alert for stop loss, I would said 40 pip if you using Sidus-Crossover Signal. Exit when Forex Trend fxfariz change color What indicator I would keep are Color Stochastic Salha_Crossover_Signal #Market Price_v1_4 anyway, attch ZIP file the indicator that I use right now. Sidus-Crossover Signal (I do not know where I find it, anyway googled unable to search for this file) For old system SHI-Silver Trend Signal Alert replace Stochastic Cross Alert Rule 1. Super Signal Alert 2. SHI-Silver Trend Signal Alert (printed on chart) 3. Signal Line and color Stochastic change color and direction 4. Signal Line and Moving Arveage form MACD 5. if gap between Moving Arveage and Signal Line, wider then super big trend otherwise small trend. for who want to enter earlier using ThreePoloSuperSmootherFilter (this indicator in attch Zip file) 4 indicator system (which I meationed before) Aroon, ADX, Stochastic, and WPR Rule 1. Aroon show end 2. Stochastic, either already crossed or soon crossover wait for 1 bar over. 3. WPR should start to toward center 4. ADX should show DI+ and DI- should try to closing gap. 5. Exit when Stochastic cross over.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Not bad.. tried out for a few trades. giving good signal.. and look at my indicator list.. haha

--- 帖子 #118 ---
For this indicator Forex Trend fxfariz you may want to hold until it alert you change trend I will try to make this indicator into EA, seems like quite good... for longer time frame

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I don´t know how to install this .m4g file on meta trader charts. If some one can help me I will thank a lot.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
where can i find the forex trend fxfariz alert ? thank you for the update also. Lionsden

--- 帖子 #121 ---
unzip the zip file, and copy all the file to C:\ProgramsMetaTrader4...\expert\indicator

--- 帖子 #122 ---
sorry somehow it is not in the zip file anyway here is

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi, Thanks for the topic. I think Forex Trend fxfariz repaints... not so good. Brian

--- 帖子 #124 ---
all indicator might reprint!!! If you follow the rules, when it show change color, using other indicator to comfirm the trend. remember if you only using one indicator along then indicator is crap! most of indicators do reprint, becuase it just do what does programmer write. there is no such things as poor programming for indicator when indicator reprint. Like Super Signal as indicator show what is current lowerst, when it meet the condition it print on chart, for a short while, it getting lower condition so it move the last printed arrow to the current. if a programmer can do an indicator without reprint. The Programer will be the best programmer! But more likely not going to happend. if programmer want, have to do a lot the checking with other indicators! think if you are an indicator. if current low is more then 10 pip do alert and print on chart. when next bar have 20 pips, it do alert few times!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I do not know if others want to see the chart anway here is I write down one more time for the rule I using now 1. Super Signal, and SHI-Silver Trend Alert have to print on chart 2. Signal line change color have good angle. 3. color stochastic change color(might already change color) 4. Aroon should show end already 5. Forex Trend fxfariz should change color. 6. Sidus-crossover alert should print on chart too(optional) if all meet, big trend! for chart below is current 30 min chart on EU

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I think it wasn't a perfect setup..

--- 帖子 #127 ---
hi mtuppers i just using your system 2day,and have a great pips,easy to understand..really,thank you so much for such a great work..it just i cannot attach the market price v 1_4 on my chart,is there any new version of it?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
you mean indicator or system? sorry that I have to say is please do not post half of what you thought! please post all of your thought! Thank you! did you double click on the indicator? it should apear on chart! I has not found any new version of market price v 1_4

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Sorry, I meant the last sign of your system wasn't perfect, because the eu is in a downtrend now. However the system isn't bad.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
what time frame? and when that happend? if you are saying about the drop during the weekend, that is unexpected. most of time I exit trade before the weekend. Anyway, no system is perfect!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Yes, there is no perfect system. About how percent of your trades are winner?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
near 100% below is double check on major trend. Aroon indicator check on 1h or 30m to see what is major trend at current Stochastic 1h sideway (going to crossover to buy) 30m just crossover 15m crossover 5m crossover buy (might going to crossover to sell) note 4h might still show very good to keep going down, then if you want using WPR, ADX(DMI) to comfirm the trend. please list all the indicator you using. if other indicator you using is not on the thread, please post them. so I might able to correct what you have done wrong. or even improve the system.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Thanks Mtuppers, but I don't have any system yet. I'm still searching my strategy here. Do you trade with real money?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
yes real, and 20% plus of real money!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
forgot to tell you all Aroon this indicator play major role in this system, therefore no if's and or but will leave this indicator out. sorry! as I am unable to edit the other post so... sorry! I hope the money you been make donate some of your money to charties or whatever who needed.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi mt. Do you mean you make 20% per month real money? My goal is to fund a $20K usd account to start and make 20% monthly. If you can help me achieve that goal, I would gladly donate at least 2% to you monthly. And you can do whatever you would like with that. And if it would grow exponentially, ...well...wonderful!!! The least I could do! Maybe a new paradigm in the making! ...Instead of handing your money to a stranger and getting ripped off Madoff style - which I know about first hand, dammit - that stranger shows you how to make money no strings attached, and you reward them accordingly. ...What a modern concept, huh??!! Happy to live in this century. It's about time!!!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I would like to have 10 trader who would like to partice on this new update before I relised to public. pm me if you intrested!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
all the current indicator I using are in this update zip file Note I am waiting if a programmer able to help me for one of two combined indicators pm me if you able to help me. thank you! watch this flash BBMACD see how it was used apply it to chart as for the band on the flash using Signal Line instand. rule colorstochastic arrow alert* (need to fix something, but is alright to use now) when it alert signal line should already change color if not no entry then super signal, and shi-slivertrend aler should printed on chart then apply the BBMACD rule. and Forex Trend Fxfariz change color if not no entry. oh using 30m and 1m colorstochastic trend as your guide if not change color yet, then trend continue. see the chart below if have any question please post on forum! *color stochastic arrow I been fixed, org show when uptrend line go over 80 printed down arrow. I think the org auther, which has same sitting as I have, do know when it is over brought it might have good signal. Remember good angle the stochastic indicator show over brought or sold mostly 5m or 15m TF some time 30m or 1h!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
better post tpl file also

--- 帖子 #140 ---
tpl file is here, but does not know it going to work or not

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I like ur system seems very good,Could you provide more info about it? Want to know depends on what ,What the concept for buy,sell signal? Also Not sure how this arrow,Simple above candle working,Is checking pattern or MA Thanks

--- 帖子 #142 ---
hi.. great job mtuppers ...I have watch the short video about bbmacd,look great...may I know where can I download the indicator many thanks in advance,

--- 帖子 #143 ---
BBMACD can found at this thread LOHAD Scalping system looking for V2.0 if want to have very easy system would be super signal and stochastic, as long as stochastic is not crossover no entry. note: I am thinking if progmmer can help me to put super signal and stochastic crossover together. as other indicators just suppot to identified the trend. note always double check on longer time frame stochastic if 30m stochastic is not crossover, the 5m or 15m stochastic should be small trend. you may enter, but remember, do not expect much profit. step is 1. when super signal alert (show arrow), change TF and back to see if shi-slivertrend signal (show dot it does not update it self) did print on chart. 2. signal line, and color stochastic should change color. (for me is Red, and blue) 3. for forex trend fxfariz should change color after.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
oo man its tooks a long time for me 2 understand,coz of my understanding of english is not so goodm,damm.. ,+ here already 3:15am,i agreed wit u bout super signal and stoch,a bit difficult for me 2 using signal line ...,for me when i see super signal+the arrow appear then wait for stoch to turn around then pull da trigger,is it correct?coz im quict new using this system,ya opinion much appreaciate mtuppers..one more problem wit me bout stoch crossover no entry,brother mind if you put just one picture for me,so that i can understand better boout crossover p/s:thanks for the link

--- 帖子 #145 ---
what Time Frame you using like 1m 5m 15m etc 1m only work best at major sessions, for other time, I may just get few pip and out. here is 30m about 2 weeks ago. this one just super signal and the stochastic crossover Note: stochastic crossover, may show arrow, before supersignal

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Hi, MTuppers! I found your thread Friday and read all of it. I'm looking forward to your progress. Where do you live? I'm in the USA, California. I hope to follow your system.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
i think this system is simple but i dont quite understand how to enter a trade. please clarify this. thanks.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Step for first method (post number 1) 1. super signal alert. 2. check Aroon (when line is goind down form top) 3. color stochastic and signal line both change color 4. signal line and moving average have good angle. second method (post number 30) 1. Aroon either line start to going down form top draw line 2. Williams' Percent R should start to going toward center 3. gold minner change color 4. color stochastic change color and direction. I like this method third method 1. Aroon end 2. Williams' Percent R should start to going toward center 3. ADX(DMI) start to close the gap between DI+ and DI- 4. stochastic should crossover 5. if ADX has big gap, and the price does not move too much to other side within 15 pip or so. then should reverse for a big trend (happend most often at big news) forth method 1. super signal alert change TF and back to see if shi-sliver trend alert does show dot on chart. 2. when color stochastic and signal line change color that is signal to enter. 3. forex trend fxfariz double check on longer TF before entry. indicators in zip file forex trend fxfariz might be more to come but... now that is steps.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thankyou for the sistem and help.... Im making an EA with it, but it isnt profitable on the strategy tester yet. Although some buys are profitable, some arent, but it doesnt loose too mutch, just a little touch left to be winning... The rules to open are, indicator by indicator: //////////////////////////////////// ****Color Stochastic v1.04d arrow alert Buy when signal is given Sell when signal is given ****Signal Line Buy or sell when it changes to the buy/sell colour and there is a jump from last value to actual one of 0.0002 at least (for EURUSD) ****Super Signal v3f Buy or sell when the last Strong Signal it gave was buy/sell ****Aroon buy or sell whenever the correspondent line goes from 100 on last bar to a lower value on actual one ****Forex Trend fxfariz Buy or sell when buy or sell signals are given ****Williams Percent Range open an order whenever it starts going to middle When ALL of this indicators tell the EA to buy, it will buy, and same with selling. //////////////////////////////////////////// As for closing the positions: If "signal line" changes colour, or "Aroon" changes direction, or "Forex Trend fxfariz" gives opposite signal, then close. /////////////////////////////////////////// No stop loss or take profit used. Any suggestions? http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/2839/testergraph.gif

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thanks Armagedoom EA contiditon to entry Aroon show end (when line start to go down form 100 check entry when line reach 95) WPR when it start to go to center, check entry for buy when it start to bounce form 0 for sell is bouncd form 100 after above condition meet, then check color stochastic change color. exit when both color stochastic change color. for other indicator I think just for double check the condition only. note: Aroon this indicator if want to be more acurate, have some other rules, like when ever line is go up like to 40 to 70 might mean current trend is going to end. oh, could you combine super signal and stochastic crossover?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Working on it. Actual settings: ENTER WHEN: SignalLine --&gt; Get ready to Buy or Sell ONLY if (its actual value)-(its previous bar's value)&gt; (Price*1.4*3/20000) Aroon --&gt; When Previous value was 100, and actual is less, gets ready to buy/sell ForexTrend --&gt; It must be in selling/buying colour to be ready to sell/buy WPR --&gt; When it starts going center from 0 --&gt; ready to Buy WPR --&gt; When it starts going center from 100 --&gt; ready to Buy ColorStochastic --&gt; Enter AFTER all previous signals are ready and it changes colour EXIT WHEN: Signal line changes color, or color stochastic changes colour EXPLANATIONS: I put the first one in red, because so far, its the most determining enter condition. If I take it out, all loosses, if I put it on, something interesting comes up. Its going slow on my computer, but so far the graph does as in the link. (1M EURUSD chart, 2 trades a day more or less). When the strategy tester finishes ill keep u informed. http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uplo...8ddb9cb055.gif On the formula,where I use "Price", i guess that the factor I multiply it for wont work for the rest of the pairs/ chart times. It will have to be adapted. Ill do tests just with 1m EURUSD by the moment. I still need to implement what you told me about aroon indicator, and yes, any combo can be done, just tell me which and Ill try it. Oops the graph just went down a bit... cant wait for it to finish the month ^^

http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/3351/testergraphz.gif Check the attachment, there u can see where it failed and where it was right (and could even check with real chart then see why it happened and how to improve). Read be4 post to know which configuration was applyed for the EA to this chart By the momment i will still be working on any sugestions you make, starting now with: "note: Aroon this indicator if want to be more acurate, have some other rules, like when ever line is go up like to 40 to 70 might mean current trend is going to end."... Mhm could you explain a litle more this rule? didnt understand.... especially the part "line is go up like to 40 to 70"... Any other rules want me to try? BTW, I like it, some times it makes a REALLY good moves, we just have 2 figure out when not to enter Thx!! I tryed to PM you, mtuppers, but the system doesnt let me. If u want me to contact you, just let me know your email. Greetz all.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I think the problem is just too much indicator to using. as I do not know if it is possible to using longer TF color stochastic as a guide or not. if is possible, then 1h or 4h should be used for only buy or sell for the smaller TF. anyway, maybe add this indicator to my system EMA Angle Zero above link is to forex-tsd.com on the first post have rules for EA I think try to using Aroon WPR stochastic EMA Angle Zero for EMA Angle Zero should be limited on bad angles as the rule on the first post said The angles are measured in Radians where 1 radian is about 57 degrees. So .33 is about 19 degrees. what we are after is good angles so I think EMA Angle Zero should help. Note I has not try yet. would it be possible to test entry as 1m have 10 pip different within a bar or two bars? if so, should be good angle! for Aroon I think super signal and stochastic crossover should slove the problem. as for manual trade some time I using only 4 indicator to do trade but what I find is when Aroon show end stochastic would going to crossover soon. if stochastic is not crossover no trade. the indicators are Aroon ADX(DMI) WPR Stochastic

--- 帖子 #155 ---
hi Armagedoom would it be possible to have alert on this indicator like super signal or stochastic crossover? or even make into EA indicator is Rads sMAC-D

--- 帖子 #156 ---
yup, just tell me when you want the alert. If you do it soon, you will have the alert-ea today posted here (only alerting). greetz.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I need is Rads sMAC-D have cross over alert seems like this indicator is very good for longer time frame

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Here, this should do the trick. Couldnt test coz today there is no market. Any problems, just report.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
First of all I would like to thank mtuppers for sharing his wonderful system with us. I have been testing the system and got some very good results by swinging the odds a little in my favor, by applying the same (original) indicators to the 1 hour chart. Then trade in the same direction as indicated by the signal line on the 1 hour chart of the 5 minute chart. If the signal line on the 1 hour chart points upwards - take only long positions on the 5 minute chart after getting a super signal arrow and waiting for the signal line to change color. If the signal line on the 1 hour chart points downward, take only the short deals of the 5 minute chart.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I noticed that a few months ago, and stopped using it. Same with BeginnerAlert.mq4

--- 帖子 #161 ---
As I only discovered this system last week, you obviously have the advantage over me. What filters do you use, if any?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Signal Line on 1 Hour chart vs aroon indicator on 5 minute chart, please see attachment

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I guess I have to swallow my words, there is place for both the signal line on the 1 hour chart as well as the aroon on the 5 minute chart, only trade when these two agree for high probability trades.Even if it sometimes means missing out on great deals, our biggest responsibility is to preserve precious capital. Please see pdf for detail.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Does the forex trend fxfariz repaint the past?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Damn, thx for making me notice that, YES it does!! And same for the super signal!! I hate indicators which repaint

--- 帖子 #166 ---
that is reason I am thinking if you could make super accurate signal! which include super signal and stochastic. (yes you do not get the signal that early but at less 99% of time is accurate!) as I posted rule as once super signal show buy then stochastic crossover should crossover for uptrend. either indicator might show earlier then another. however once if both indicator agreed. 99% plus of time is accurate. hope programmer can help!

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi mtuppers, A really good system you have here. I have tried really hard to follow the whole thread so i can get the full picture of how your system works but i am sorry to say that i am only getting more confused. So I would be glad if you can give examples (using pictures) of the rules (the ones you posted in #1 and #30). I would be glad if you could please give charts that include buy entry point and sell entry point and probably their take profit and stop loss. I think this would help me understand it better. Thanks Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
sorry earlyman that I has not post reply last week. anyway I find a better easier system indicators Super Signal v3f Signal Line ThreePoleSuperSmoothFilter nxMACD Rads sMAC-D rule is when super signal alert, wait for nxMACD to change color and Rads sMAC-D crossover Note Rads sMAC-D would be next TF stochastic update with template. note, will only work with all the indicators in indicator folder.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Blue line is around 100 and yellow is below 30. What is that telling me? Thanks

--- 帖子 #170 ---
if blue line is uptrend then more likely it going to end soon, then yellow line more likely be the trend. using signal line as your guide.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Now I'm confused again.Which color is for up uptrend and which is for down trend? I thought that you once said that if yellow line is pointed up it is uptrend. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
would you post a chart? I just think what might be... http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...4&amp;d=1224765294 for example above chart blue is downtrend, red is uptrend. when blue go all the way up and down, trend is ended (around 19 Oct 22:45), uptrend start.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
mtuppers, Ok.Now sometime the blue line is way up around 70 -100 and other time it is the other line that is up high.I wanted to know which line tells me what? Also on what time frame is super signal most reliable please? Why does it beep up strong sell when f.e. trend and candles are bearish ? Sometime the arrow is dark blue for buy and sometime it is light green. Any importance?And the little sign that looks like star..what does it represents? Your newest indicator? Are they better or the earlier one is as good? Thank lot.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
for super signal higher time frame is way more reliable, however, may lost more too. using other indicators to help you to avoid the wrong signal. as for Aroon indicator remember, you may want just enter when the line start pushing down. what ever other line is doing, it does not matter most of time. I think you might want to put this indicator in same sub window as aroon. as indicator y_effect_m.mq4 after you put the y_effect_m in indicator folder open meta4, later move mouse over y_effect_m one click and hold it and drag to aroon sub window when the super signal show strong sell, is when the indicator think at current time frame is reached it's current high, that is reason it said strong sell. the sign look like star more likely is minor buy or sell, however, I think only good for closing order. there are quite a bit of good indicators. however, I still think stochastic is very good along all of the indicators. please post a chart, so I can understand what colors that for your indicator!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
mtuppers You stated:you may want just enter when the line start pushing down. what ever other line is doing, it does not matter . Which line the top or bottom Aroon line and is that a sell or buy indication when it start to push down? I placed y_effect_m.mq4 over Aroon now i need to know how to interpret this indicator.If you can give some pointers that would be great. Thanks again.I like this system and really want to learn it.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
sorry wrong file will pm you.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hey mtuppers, guess what i found out when I tested your system, I found out it could work with a lot of currency pairs. Not only that, I tried using it with M30 timeframe and oh how great the result I got. Rule for entry: Enter trade when the lines in the nxMACD indicator cross. Rule for exit: Exit when lines in nxMACD have crossed over again or when you have grabbed enough pips. Below I have attached a USDCHF chart on M30 time frame indicate an entry into a trade. In this case I took a short trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hey! As you know Mtuppers, im following your thread, coz I like the simplicity and I still think that a combo of indicators could lead us very high... I told you I tried programming thoose together, and tryed many combos, but got nothing interesting, although from time to time I will still try again and report if I get something.... Just wanted to point out that I found an indicator similar to "Super Signal" but without the repainting..... well just my 2 cents hope this helps, its the Goldminer and maybe you all already got it but I think its very promising...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I just finished reading the pdf. This system is really nice. It's not something like the famous holy grail. But with MA cross and MACD and price action, that's all we need to "sense" movement. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
sorry as I remove the forextrend and AO alert as first forextrend do reprint. therefore when forextrend change color for small trend it just too late. so what would be the point to wait for AO alert. Kingstrendsigsig is like goldminer 1. signal almost the same, sometimes one bar earlier or later. as current, buy eur/usd only!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Here is the Goldminer only Ea, I would like you guys to backtest in visual mode and see if you see a good pattern by filtering the entrances with another of thoose indicators, which I will gladly add if you tell me... I have been trying to mix it with the stochastic crossover alert, got nothing interesting, there is the EA too, try if you want with different pairs and tp/sl. (It is the MOD version). (Original EA is not mine, I found it elsewhere, I didnt change the credits)

--- 帖子 #182 ---
myuppers, I am using supersignal since almost one year. what do you think it is based upon? I mean upon macd or rsi or what.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
not macd or rsi. super signal how it work is like there are 25 bars(candles) at first 20 bars the 20th bar has current high price then alert, after 20th bar price drop a bit, however at 25th bar has the higherst price counted form 5 to 25 so it alert again. and reprint the alert as removed the 20th bar signal and reprint the arrow at 25th hope it is clear.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
mmmmmm,so it depends on highest high of certain period of time.(or low). I used it a year a go (not from this sit), but I find it non consistant.so i stopped. but i see here a new version i think. is there any difference between it and the old one?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I said before as if you using one indicator you are gambling! so using at less 3 indicators to help you to filter out bad signals every version concept is same, therefore, not much different. as different is it add some minor buy and sell, but not too effective. however you may want to using kingstrendsigsig or goldminer 1 as your entry signal. as new one is super signal v3f (based on version 2) as different between version 3 and 2 is add minor buy and sell (I did not code this version as I modified version already as version 3) I just modified for to let user to have 4 option as strong buy or sell buy only sell only all signal for new version, may required some major work. as how to combine 2 indicator into one and name of indicator may be as super acurate signal. as indicators super signal and stochastic crossover, however, I not a good programmer therefore I still unable to get the code done.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Bro, i am using your super signal v3f (based on version 2) and also the kingstrendsigsi. From the attached, see the last candle, is it the right time to go long now? or should i wait for other signals? or should i wait for the nxMACD? Other indicators there in the attached, i am not sure how to use, can you help? thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #187 ---
back testing for mod version, I did not change anything, no trades at all

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi Mtuppers and all others following this topic! First of all thnx for the time invested in making and sharing this system, great work! I'm trying to do some testing with it and so far it's looking good in Demo but after reading the complete topic I'm not able to figure out exactly what indicators I should use and how I should use them. Is there any manual or good despriction what indicators to use and how to use them? (if not then I can offer my help in creating a good manual) Kind regards and keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
yes! that would be good idea to have another version of manual and put other thought together. maybe will improve the system most of info is at this post post 148

--- 帖子 #190 ---
what you should wait is Rads SMAC-D crossover or as MACD I think. or using color stochastic as your entry signal because if that is confirm then when you wait for MACD to crossover you will pocket your pips

--- 帖子 #191 ---
bro, u see the attached one? for 1) and 2)... Can help to answer? thanks

--- 帖子 #192 ---
at 2 is long 1 is short nxMACD red is long and blue is short for inactive time exit when super signal alert.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thanks a lot for the prompt reply! If we just look at the nxMACD for the entry signal, then how about threepolesmootherfilter and the signal line? (see attached), do we see them for entry signal as well? And so we exit when the super signal alert? What is the preferred time frame? cos i now looking at M30.... Really thanks for your assistance

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I find out as best time frame is 1m or 5m sometimes 15m longer time frame, you are more likely can trust nxMACD longer time frame as for threepolesmootherfilter and the signal line it is stochastic for next time frame. but for higher time frame to have good entry signal more unlikely. but if you trust stochastic and signal line is good enough,

--- 帖子 #195 ---
nice.good effort.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
THanks for the prompt reply. In Summary, we should use the below indicators 1) signal line 2) stochastic 3) nxMACD 4) Rads SMAC-D 5) Supersignal v3f 6) KingtrendsigSig Time Frame: 1M, 5M or 15M (nxMACD) Signal to entry: i) when Rads SMAC-D crossover ii) MACD change color. nxMACD blue - long entry nxMACD red - short entry iii) signal line change color red - long entry blue - short entry iv) stochastic oscillation (14,3,3, exponential) less than 10 - long entry more than 90 - short entry v) Kingtrendsigsig when blue up arrow - long entry when red down arrow - short entry When 5 indicators all shows the same signal, then we can go short or long. Signal to exit i) when supersignal v3f alert to buy only sell only strong buy strong sell Hi, am i correct on the above? thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #197 ---
for higher time frame using super signal, signal line (color stochastic should agreed) as for 1m to 15m Rads SMAC-D crossover, then other indicators just for confirm. as for KingtrendsigSig can use as entry signal, because it more likely when SMAC-D crossover, then KingtrendsigSig print and alert. as my uptrend is red, and downtrend is blue.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I think 'super signal' is a very good indicator. Normally, previously, considering my experiences,the arrow or cross indicator in chart represent signal too fast or slow...hence I could not believe these kind of indicator. however your indicator gives me often an appropriate timing to jump in ,especially super signal!! my appreciation to you defy descriptions. Good luck to you.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
thanks bro mtuppers for the reply. So you mean for higher time frame, example 30M and above, we can just used the super signal and signal line for entry? But how about exit signal? which indicator should we based on? By the way, is it possible to do some printscreen of the examples so that we can have a clearer view? thanks

--- 帖子 #200 ---
for exit signal if you just want profit then exit when super signal alert or signal line change color. that is entry signal only. but still based on the macd crossover is safer. as chart below is 1h or eur/usd current chart with only super signal and signal line. as you can see below some times when it alert strong sell, however, price does not go to far and signal line change color (at Sept 16 21:00)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thx for the examples! But we could not enter on thoose setups, because remember supersignal redraws madly, so all the signals of there will probably appear way before / after the bar is formed... So, can we see an entry based on non-redrawing indicators plz?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
this indicator below maybe is what we are looking for! sorry Has not test yet.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi Mtuppers, I dont know how but this seems to work thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Zigzag pionter seems to be a better indicator, however it re-draws too. I think the best way to use it would be as a reference or as a short term trend highlighter, which is a great tool too.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
so can i say that this indicator is to replace the super signal??? thanks but what do u all means by re-draw? thanks

--- 帖子 #206 ---
hi, see attached, i go sell when i see the blue signal line...22 Sep 0900hrs.. for AUDUSD 1H, but it seems that it did not go my way.. may i know what have i done wrong? thanks

--- 帖子 #207 ---
most of time trend will retesting the high or low before it turn another way. as current time(22 Sept 1200hrs). nxMACD show all blue, and Rads SMAC-D going to cross over soon. jeywhistle means reprint

--- 帖子 #208 ---
yes zigzag pointer will redraw however, it one is way more like confirm instant of reprint. using Aroon this indicator to help you to see if trend is ended.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I just took 255 points and have another 260 waiting for trend to end works for me lol

--- 帖子 #210 ---
what indicators u using? and what is ur time frame?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
using 4hr im when supersignal strong coloured stoch rads mach and signal line same colour out on change colour rads mach

--- 帖子 #212 ---
hi, thanks for the prompt reply. do u mind if u can print screen some examples? cos i really not sure what u mean.. thanks I am now using 5M and entry when macd cross over....

--- 帖子 #213 ---
hi bro mtuppers, any new developments? thanks.. or can help to summary the whole thing, eg used what indicators, etc...

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I think pretty much done for the development of this system. However, at 4shared.com you still can find a lot of indicators (you may not know if it is indicator or ea). yes it might have some update later on. as for title of this system should change to Super Simple MACD System. Reason: MACD this is most profitable indicator at less for EA. summary for first 4 system at this post 148 the 5th system at this post 168 for all systems if you are not sure about current trend. always double check on higher time frame. at less super signal should alerted and printed. what Stumpy1 mean is when nxMACD and signal line change color have good angle the trend is confirmed. I draw line to let you see what Stumpy1 mean.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Nice and simple.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Mtuppers, In post 214 your last post you show your final version it seems to me I have a differant version of nx macd Could you please post a zip file with the indicaters and a template of the version you show in your last post. Thanks for all the pips so far

--- 帖子 #217 ---
sorry I did not check for nxMACD as mq4 file not avilable to public, I did using ex4 to mq4 and change the color. but only give out ex4 file. but should be same as the post 214

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Thanks thats just what I was looking for will give moore feedback

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I need a template for this system. thanks

--- 帖子 #220 ---
thanks for the reply... so u r not using stoch anymore? thanks

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I still using it when aroon show end. that the trend for confirm. like when higher time frame Super Signal alerted and printed. you can go to smaller time frame for a while to see if trend is confirm. template is in this zip file easy2.zip

--- 帖子 #222 ---
oic... what is aroon? i never used it.. thanks

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi Mtuppers, need ur guidance again, pls see attached. I did a long when i see the nxMACD crossing and the signal line changing to red which indicate a long signal. But however i think i am wrong.. is going down now.. may i know what is wrong with this? thanks

--- 帖子 #224 ---
The red cross was a sell signal you need a buy signal as well as the other conditions

--- 帖子 #225 ---
what u mean by that e red cross was a sell signal? i saw e MACD crossing as indicated on the attached previously... then the signal line also turns red.. that is why i go into a long..

--- 帖子 #226 ---
would you zip up the indicators and temp. you are using let me see what is problem. otherwise I am unable to answer questions! thanks. Aroon is an indicator that more likely will show when trend is end and start new trend. very good indicator to use with super signal. as rule as see the chart below when super signal alerted and printed, aroon uptrend or downtrend, should already hit 100(at top). entry would be when the trend line start to move down. and signal line agree.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi, attached is my zip file... but i got the zip file from this thread... unless i get an outdated one... Btw, can send me the aron file? would like to check it out...but i not sure how to read that aron indicator? there are two lines, which one should i see? thanks

--- 帖子 #228 ---
okay, you using the easy system, but remember double check on next time frame. if you are not sure about the trend. we are after angle more then 30 degree or more. the one you enter only have 10 degree. that is not a entry signal at all. using color stochastic note: there are some error as it only draw arrow on chart when it crossover 80 either up trend or down trend. as for aroon. rule magenta color is up trend aqua color is down trend. when the line is going down form 100 that mean more likely trend is ended. sorry to saying, I think you have learn an indicator at a time. I draw a line on 1m eur/usd before the line, is no entry, after the line, is entry signal

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi, i change the stoch to aroon... but still not sure how to see for aroon. Please see my attached for the question. U were saying angle more than 30, r u referring to the nxMACD angle? thanks

--- 帖子 #230 ---
i try out the Color Stochastic v1.04d 1.mq4 and never know that it also have a alert as well... too many alerts coming out for Color Stochastic v1.04d 1.mq4 and also for the supersignal v3f... it making me a bit confusing.. lol

--- 帖子 #231 ---
turn super signal alert off. I will answer your question 6 hours later. lol missed 20 pip profit

--- 帖子 #232 ---
ok, no problem so i just stick to Color Stochastic v1.04d 1.mq4 signal for exit? so i used Color Stochastic v1.04d 1.mq4 instead of aroon then? awaiting for ur reply.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
using both. as aroon is to indentifed the end of trend or beginning of trend. for color stochastic as I post before as the good angle most of time the color stochastic should very fast go to 80 or above for uptrend and go to 20 or below for downtrend. try to line up 3 time frame at less like 1m 5m and 15m so when 15m super signal printed, and see lower time frame like 1m if stochastic go up or down very fast. then at 1m should have very good angle. however, check 5m nxMACD it should already change color. I understand what your problem is. as you are try to get every trend opportunity.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
i see... so i should have aaron and color stochastic in my chart huh.. but will it be too squeezy to see? can u give an example of both aroon, color stochastic and MACD signals? btw, as in my last reply, i not sure how to see the aroon indicator... thanks

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi, as u mentioned that i should use both aroon and stochastic for entry signal... as attached, which one should give me e 1st signal of entry? or i just see which indicator give the entry signal first? and also how abt the exit signal? previously we were seeing the supersignal for exit, is it still the same? then how abt the alert for the color stochastic? is it accurate? please see attached as well...for 15M it say Up trend alert and for 5M it say down trend alert... so which one is more accurate? i have also attached the 5M for u to reference as well.. thanks

--- 帖子 #236 ---
for good angle should already in over brought or sold for color stochastic. for your entry I would said using 1m chart. at 1m when Rads SMAC-D crossover, it is a trend for 5m stochastic so 5m when Rads SMAC-D crossover, it is a trend for 15m stochastic and so on. check the chart below I draw line when it want to crossover, well for real time maybe a bit late, however, would be accurate . check next TF stochastic as your guide, and check back current TF to see if MACD agreed if so. signal to entry. chart 1. 1m draw line when Rads SMAC-D crossover 2. when change to 5m TF that is what 1m line for SMAC-D crossover. 3. 5m draw line when Rads SMAC-D crossover 4. when change to 5m TF that is what 15m line for SMAC-D crossover. for chart 3 and 4 check at next post

--- 帖子 #237 ---
chart 3 and 4

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Mtuppers, thanks for the reply. By the way, i refer to my M1 and M5 for EUR/USD ( Please see attached). For 1M time frame, there is a cross over for MACD and when i refer to 5M, it indicate a downtrend for stochastic and so does the stochastic alert... in this kind of scenario, is that a short signal? and can i do a short entry? if so, when would be the right time to exit? Because when i change to 15M time frame, the stochastic alert indicate a uptrend (see attached), i am confused whether should i do a short or long signal? By the way, you have not explained how to see the aroon indicator? because i not sure how to see the aroon indicator.. thanks

--- 帖子 #239 ---
http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1253991998 okay for you forget about aroon indicator, if you want study your self, because you can use color stocastic as a guide. study chat above. what does aroon do when color stochastic change direction for most of time? trending rule is very simple all three indicator have to have same color as indicators are nxMACD, color stochastic, signal line. if all three indi's have same color and have some angle(not too flat) when it happen that is trading signal. as for exit using super signal. as for post post. always using higher time frame as your guide, if not sure, check next time frame. and do not trade at inactive time. if you want. off couse at your on risk.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi.. thanks for the prompt reply... i cant see the pattern for the aroon... from your attachement given, if the stochastic goes down, both the line for aroon also go down... so what can that conclude? thanks by the way, u were saying to look at differernet time frame to confirm the signal.. so can i just see 3 different time frame, 1M, 5M and 15M ? once the 3 time frame confirm a short trade then i go for it? is the stochastic alert important? or i can just turn it off? thanks

--- 帖子 #241 ---
if not sure using higher time frame would be safer, however, still wait for your signal. if you go other way. you know you might loss or gain some profit and out. now I has not find a good alert signal to trade with. some is too late, some is too early. therefore if you want to turn off it is up to you. or you try to notice for super signal at less 2 bar or 3 bar ended, and and super signal is way off form the current price only for 1m or 5m TF. sorry I will not reply post until Oct 2. afternoon PST.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
hi, thanks for the reply.. but i still not sure how to see the aroon indicator? can give an example? thanks I am using 1M and 5M to gauge my entry signal.. i let u know if there is any problem or perhaps, u can show us also? thanks

--- 帖子 #243 ---
study this chart below, it is easy to under stand how to read aroon indicator. Attached Image (click to enlarge) when color stochastic change direction above 20 aroon indicator should show the aroon downtrend line start to going down form 100 toward 0 means down trend line loss control of the trend. so when color stochastic below 80 aroon indicator uptrend line start to going down form 100 toward 0 means uptrend line is loss control. yes loss control may be just for current time. anyway I will not answer more about how to read aroon indicators. Please read though the thread. I did say how to read. also other member do helping other how to read.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
hi.. thanks mtuppers for the help... i roughly know how to see the aroon indicator... by the way, in summary... if i were to see timeframe M5, M15 and M30 for confirm signal right? 1) if MACD cross over in M5 2) go to M15 and see whether the stochastic indicate the same signal... 3) go to M30 and see if the signal line indicate the same signal. So if MACD in M5 cross over M15 stochastic same signal M30 signal line same signal equal entry signal the same goes if we look at other time frames... M30, H1, H4 Is the above correct? thanks One last thing i would like to ask about the exit signal, you were saying for exit signal, we have to look at the super signal to signal us but which time frame should we see in? M5, M15 or M30??? thanks

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi all, from the attached H4... what entry would u go? just not sure whether did i get the wrong signal again? it always goes against the signal that i see... Please correct me.. thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
you get correct entry. however, as for all usd pair show usd is strong at less for usd crossed pair on 4h chart. but daily chart show down trend! what are you enter buy for? anyway, for you would be better just go with three indicator with angle rule as indicator nxMACD with Rads SMAC-D Signal Line Color stochastic and maybe with Aroon rule is as long as all indicator have some color that is entry signal. exit when color change!

--- 帖子 #247 ---
ok thks.... then i just stick to the one that u recommend... hope that i can get some profits out of it... so the exit signal is when either of the time frame change signal on any of the indicator? (nxMACD with Rads SMAC-D, Signal Line ,Color stochastic) because i am still not so sure about the exit signal, whether to see on which time frame.... Now i am seeing M1, after which M5 and M15, cos i thought u recommend the supersignal to exit but not sure which time frame do i look at for exit signal.. thanks

--- 帖子 #248 ---
yes you may using m15 for exit.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi, there...anyway to contact u personally? msn or anything? thanks

--- 帖子 #250 ---
hi, i think i did not get the signal right.. i just go in a aud/usd for a short signal based on the indicator signals (see the line attachement).. based on M1, M5 and M15... but now it is going in the opposite direction... losing 11pips now. PLease see attached. m1, m5 and m15. The signal was correct for the 3 tf but when i entered, it goes the other way.. may i know what wrong? thanks i was thinking if you were to see the MACD cross over for 1M signal, and for the confirmation for 5M and 15M, it would be too late to enter. and if you were to say that if to wait for the angle for MACD cross over, it would be too late.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi... I'm newbie with forex. m'm sorry for this ridiculous question. but how to use it?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hey, i think this one will be the most kind answr to your question: You have to read a lot before asking.... You dont even specify if you cant even use the indicators in metatrader, or even install metatrader at all.... go to babypips and learn... first stages in forex (and probably all of the rest too) consist in a lot of learning and reading, and when you post here it would be good that you post something about the system not how to configure metatrader

--- 帖子 #253 ---
using 1m as your entry! when super signal show at 15m and see if 1m MACD start to crossover, and 5m stochastic change direction. that is entry signal. if you wait 15m chart it will be too late.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
thanks for the reply. Yup, i take 1M as my entry.. when the 1M MACD start to cross over and 5M stochastic change direction, i will go in.. but however although e MACD starts to cross over, but when i go in, the MACD actually did not cross over completely and hence i have done a wrong enty... so i am not sure how to prevent this.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
what is your trading time? as I am saying try not to trade at inactive time. what is 1m entry the signal line and moving average have good angle of MACD? if not no entry. also does 15m show end? maybe my system is not really for you! what kind of angle of the signal line and moving average? post your chart thanks

--- 帖子 #256 ---
thanks.. i wil post screenshot later... normally i dun have any preferences time to trade... either when new york is open or in the day. (GMT 8+). by the way, u thought of doing an EA with your system?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
someone tried, does not work. read the thread please.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi, attached are the examples... M1 give a short signal and M5 and M15 also indicate a short signal Hence i do a short now... hopefully it will go down.. i just aim for a 4 pips profit..

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I have been reading this thread with great interest and can't wait to try this system next week. I have noticed alot of confusion over the Aroon indicator and can I suggest changing its colours to your preferred up/down trend colour scheme. For example I use lime green for up and red for down on all my indicators and candles. Once you have the lines on Aroon matching your theme you can see what mtupper means. If a new downtrend is about to start the red line will have reached 100 and then be sloping down. When the downtrend about to end it will be closer to 0 and the green line will have gone up to 100 indicating new uptrend in the near future. Seems to be more accurate with the 20 setting. See attached chart for trades that could have been taken Friday (daytime Australia - my trading time). Max pips of course is probably not achievable but according to this chart if you stay in the trade until Aroon reaches its maximum level more pips can banked. Seems it gave only 1 possible losing trade using just the arrows and all indicators agreeing on colour. It would depend on your entry price and stop loss preferences. I do have a question though about the arrows and crosses - arrows seem obvious but what are the crosses? Please note this chart was static and I have not looked at it while markets moving - problem could be if arrows move down with trend and repaint as do many indicators which try to pick top and bottoms. Looking forward to trying it out Monday. Thanks Mtuppers for all your hard work and great website at Forex Optical.

julie1585 can you maybe share your template? Thanks

--- 帖子 #261 ---
when I want to extract the file, I can't do it. can anyone help me? thank you

--- 帖子 #262 ---
"julie1585 can you maybe share your template? Thanks" Hi Fabje, sure. Trading went well, just 2 silly mistakes but all the rest positive trades up 183 pips. I deleted goldmine2 as it repaints horribly at least 3 lines back - on 5 min chart that is bad. Looks good in hindsite but no good for true entries. Deleted Super Signal as the arrows move down with trend so only really telling you trend could change some time in the future. I found it disconcerting while on a good short trade to have an arrow in the opposite direction for 76 pips. I like Aroon set at 20 for 5 minute chart but found if I checked other time frames it didn't look right. Mostly used the Market indicator for other TF which is great to easily see what candle is forming and trend on all time frames. Good for overall sense of where its going. I believe pivots are essential for such short term trading so I have daily, s1-3 and r1-3 and midpoints, also have yesterdays high and low as they can be pivotal points also. I have been looking for a system that fits in with pivot point trading and this seems to. Looking forward to rest of week trading. I am hoping to eventually lose a couple of the indicators to make it a nice, clear template. Moving averages and williams R are probably not necessary. I like the BBMACD, need to study the info again on this indicator. I use plain shi_silver_trend as i don't want the alerts at this time. The dots on silver trend are reasonably stable and only appear very close to end of trend. They occasionally move 1 or 2 candles but still seem to find low or high point in a timely fashion. Good warning that you should be thinking of getting out of trade if you get opposite dot. Please note I have only tried it 1 day in Asian market and only GBPUSD on demo - not saying it is perfect but so far i like the way it works. Please Note: Swap the red and green colours on Aroon round on my template for correct interpretation.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
It seems mtuppers and a few others have changed many of the indicators it hardly resembles the original system. I am finding the signal line, stochastic, silver_trend, aroon to be enough to confirm entry and use aroon and or silver_trend to exit. Also having pivots on screen is really useful. I really like the original system. Can i ask why you needed to change it - was it producing irregular results? Maybe i was just lucky today - finished with nearly 300 pips (demo). I will add the nMACD and SMAC indicators to see if they improve things but how do you get them in one window? I have tried dragging from chart and from indicator list. I was told once but have forgotten how to do it.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I just try to improve the system to be simple as possible. as the org system is you have to wait until have good angle, then you well get very good results. for dragging indicator(s) open nxMACD and drag Rads SMAC-D over nxMACD (forgot this two indicators) if you using color stochastic forget W%R see julie1585 chart above it almost same. nxMACD and Rads SMACD-D may not work well not higher Time Frame as it may be choppy market.

Read about Aroom here: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aroon.asp?&amp;viewed=1 http://www.onlinetradingconcepts.com...sis/Aroon.html Ok had another go at researching and understanding the Aroon indicator and it seems I had my colours round the wrong way and thus interpreted the lines slightly differently to what is meant. Apparently when the green line is in the 70 zone up trend is strong - when it starts to move out thru the 70 line trend is ending, (a bit like over bought) if red line moves to 70 zone red will be dominant trend. If they don't swap sides cleanly and stay in the dead zone, it likely be sideways market. Mtuppers or anyone who understands the Aroom can you confirm my understanding is correct or not. Note I have Aroom set to 80/20 - just prefer all to be the same. There is an Aroom oscillator http://www.onlinetradingconcepts.com...is/Aroon2.html which just has 1 line (2 colours)- that may be easier to understand. Does anyone have it? Thanks so much for everyones help and this system.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
here is the aroon Oscillator in one color as attchment seems like using color stochastic is good enough see chart below

Thanks Mtuppers, no i did'nt like the look of that one either. I am specifically looking for the one like the jpg above that converts the 2 line one we use to a one line version. It takes away the difference of the 2 lines and displays that instead of both lines. I think it would be helpful to see easily which trend is dominant and how strong. But I am starting to get the hang of the one you gave us. Thanks agin Mtuppers, I am hoping I can stick with this system and really get my tradiing going.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
for the one you are looking for I am don't think there is such one. I think because this one is not accurate so. no one using it. if you look at longer TF and just using when 2 trend line crossover rule. you will see why!

The Aroon indicator is really good especially with the setting of 50, has anyone got a version that will give a sound alert when it is at 100? Also I found it fits well in the same place as nxMACD leaving more space free for the candle chart. Great system thank you to those who have contributed especially to Mtupper for sharing your work

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Fourxxxx, what u mean by setting of 50? do you mind if u can give an example? Picture speaks a thousand words.. thanks

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I am talking about setting as Mtupper has done right from post number 1 there will soon be a thousand pictures on this topic but you need just one word FIFTY

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Here is the picture with Aroon combined with nxMACD

--- 帖子 #273 ---
i see... thanks. Btw, may i know what is the signal for entry? thanks

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I use this When Aroon starts going down on 1 minute chart, buy or sell when signal line changes colour. (I have changed colours so Blue going down is buy and red for sell) This must agree with trend on 5 Min, 15 Min and 30 Min. Exit when smacd crosses back at end of the run. Pip pip FourXXXX

Here is a picture to help

--- 帖子 #276 ---
thanks man... Is for all pairs? or mainly on EURUSD? What is the successful rate? Do you set any TP or SP? guess i have to try it out and see whether it works on me..

--- 帖子 #277 ---
bro, by the way, how u place two indicators on the same windows? My aroon and macd is separate windows.. how to place them together in one windows? so u have to glue to the monitor and wait for the aroon to go down? thanks

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi... i know how to put in e same windows for two indicators... thanks man!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yes you have to watch for Aroon to go down and the signal line to change with an angle greater than 30 degrees(this all as per Mtupper, he's the MAN, or the Woman LOL), the other indicators will give you alerts but many times way before needed and as Julie said they can be telling you to go the other way when that is not the best thing to do.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
thanks dude... it works with all pairs? How many pips did u mostly catch? thanks and any stop loss strategy? thanks

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi Fourxxx, this works on only one pairs? That means u only enter based on the aroon indicator, when it goes down, u either buy or sell? U did not see the SMACD? U only see Smacd when exit? U were saying the conditions must agree with 5 Min, 15 Mins and 30 mins... which means, that for 5 Mins, 15 Mins and 30 Mins, the Aroon must go down with the same color right?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
the system is work for every pair. if all 3 time frame agree off course you may hold longer time frame. that is reason I saying using longer time frame as your guide. like sometime when I trade 1m always double check on 3 time frames. and if 3 time frame agree. I will hold longer. for example check your self on your own chart. at 30m TF what was happen on nxMACD? it should be uptrend color. so you know it is safe to enter long only. you may enter short at 1m chart at less 5m chart have to be agree on stochastic.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I've been following this thread with great interest. Why are there no latest feed from our regular...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
either this system is not good enough or is too good I think this system is the first one not good enough.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I have combined the Super Signal and Aroon from here with the THV system also on Forex Factory, these 2 give very good early signal, but sometimes there are many false entries without elements of THV but the combination is working out well for me.

Hey Mtuppers, I disagree, I think this system will work very well. I am trying to make it a scalping system specifically for 1m. I have been trying different indicators to assist. Currently using Signal Line, ema crossover alerts(arrows), the colour stochastic, nxMACD and SMACD, QQE (adv) and just added FX Snipers Ergodic CCI to see if that aids in entry. I wrote down all my trades last 2 sessions and all the losing trades I did not have all of my entry signals - usually missing 1 and thinking yeah close enough. The winning trades had all entry signals correct. I am very trigger happy so need to get more discipline obviously then I can make this work as a great scalping system. Here is a chart of a trade today - my entry signals for long trade at present: 1 min 1. Signal line changed to aqua 2. MACD histo blue 3. Light blue SMACD above white - recent cross preferred 4. Stochastic blue and either heading north or in 80 zone 5. QQE above red signal line 6. QQE heading north preferably above 50 7. FX Sniper says LONG (blue above red) 8. EMA crossover up arrows visible This can be gauged fairly quickly as all indicators should be blue and heading up. Important: check 5m to see if signal line also aqua Long trade should be suggested by indicators on 5m. For example better if 5m MACD also blue, QQE above red and 50 etc. Be wary if 5m long trend looks to be about to end or if close to round number or pivot. For me 7 out of 19 trades failed because the 5m signal line was opposite colour. Exits can be any of these: 1. predetermined scalping pips - say 5-15 on GBPUSD. 2. multiple lots and scale out. 3. Change of signal line colour - trade will reverse (wait for close of candle) - sometimes can stay in if at beginning of 5m trend. 4. MACD changes colour 5. SMACD blue line crosses or points towards a cross. 6. Check 5m to see if its best to exit or hold. So I hope we can continue to work together and get a super simple system consistently profitable. I intend to go live very soon. Just gotta get my finger off the trigger until all rules satisfied. Any suggestions, tips etc greatly appreciated as I am just learning these indicators. Thanks again Mtuppers.

here is two indicators would help in trades one is cycle indentifer the other SEFC 084 (bull and bear) cycle indentifer do reprint. however good for scalping with 1m SEFC 084 is very good however I think is commercial indicator no mq4 file. if owner of this indicator please pm me. rule aroon and cycle indentifer confirm the trend. SEFC 084 change color. and other indicator should agree already. note: SEFC 084 would give you right signal, however, at chopping market. may not be that well. for cycle indentifer I upload 2 files 1 is for major which you see below (and well reprint) however when SEFC 084 change color then should not reprint unless it does not think it is ended. the other as all which you will see all the cycle detected, however will still show major one as size 4 bar

I really enjoy this thread. Does anyone happen to have an EA that will buy and sell based strictly on the (Blue/Red) SIGNAL LINE shown in the main window? I need to have something to work from to modify with some ideas I'm playing with. Of course I will post my mods for all to use. I hope someone has one...

--- 帖子 #289 ---

Hey I am also using Aroon Ocilator with DODa it works well at higher time frame

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Im new to the super signal and the stochastic single line and I was wondering if someone could point me to a video explaining how they work or a post i could read

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Good Morning all I to am very interested in the supersignal v3 indicator its very good for filtering out trades once loaded but I dont think i understand how it works which is bugging me this is my understanding please correct me if im wrong It is similar to zig zag or having two zigzag where it is hunting for highs and lows in the market. the X's are looking for minor trend reversals and the arrow and X is a major trend reversal point. This means that when the current candle is making a new high it will follow or jump to that candle and long as it exceed the last major high.... is that correct????? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #239 ---
i think mr tuppers is dead no more conection since 2018 all thanks his system and collabos
