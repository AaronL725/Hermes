Hello Liviu,

good luck for your thread....I just subscribed....

Yesterday I saw your post in the other thread explaining and sharing this strategy, downloaded the target bands indi and implemented it to my charts....and made a visuell backtest with some currencies...looks very fine, should give a lot of pips...will see.

May I ask some questions?

1. You are paying spreads and commissions as shown in your screens. I am sure you know that there are a lot of brokers around the world where you only pay spreads or

commissions....just wondering.

2.You take at top or bottom of a channel independent of the direction of the channel? If the channel goes strongly down, you place long trades against its direction after a signal?

3. Are you able to give a nearly %-number of win quote using this Billy and Jim?

Thanks a lot in advance and have a nice day

If you are profitable you will have a smaller spread ...

talk to your broker about this

look at this system and make it your own

it doesn't matter how I enter ...

it's very nice to discover you ... yourself ... because you will have a heart full of joy when you discover ...

it also has weaknesses

but those are strong points if you notice them ...

and you find them useful in your favor

Hi Liviu,

Thanks for sharing friend. You have a solid system here. I will be comparing it with my system in the future. I was able to get into a nice buy and sell trade today using your setup.

Anyway, as I have mentioned before I will close all my trades today and will be going on holiday. Will be seeing you sometime in January.

Have a blessed Xmas,

Hi LvMMT,

I have found one of your indicators that says it is nrp (non re painting). It repaints less.

However, it does repaint, some.

I added a chart re-fresh to help.

Do you know which indicator is plotting the large blue box on your chart?

Hey LvMMT,

this EA looks to be mind blowing....

it will be like the cockpit of a starfighter...

very amazing and fantastic...god bless you....

suggestion as wished:

is it possible to implement the following features?
1. when position reaches target, sell X-% and set SL to BE + X-pips
2. when several positions are running, close all when the basket has reached
a winning amount of X or X-pips....
3. a trailstop

Have a nice day

a few small losers but still a great day with great trades for me, ty

--- 帖子 #175 ---
1. when position reaches target, sell X-% and set SL to BE + X-pips
Example:
o,5 lot long...entry 1.2550....target 1.2580
price reaches 1.2580....close 0,25 lot (sell x%...variable of the EA was set to 50)
SL for 0,25 moves to 1.2560 (SL to BE + x-pips....variable of the EA was set to 10)
Now 50% of the position was bagged to account...the other 50% built a free trade with the chance of much more profit,
saved by the SL in little profit which moves as price climbes up and up.
Hope its clear now.

2. when several positions are running, close all when the basket has reached a winning amount of X or X-pips.

Example:

A.0,01 lot long...entry 1.2550

B.0,01 lot long...entry 1.2560

C.0,01 lot long...entry 1.2570
price reaches 1.2540...positions=-10...-20...-30=-60 pips
D.0,03 lot added entry 1,2540
price reaches 1.2550...positions= 0.....-10....-20...+30=BE

price reaches 1.2555...positions=+5......-5....-15...+45=+30 pips

Now all positions are closed by EA (winning amount of x or x-pips...variable of the EA was set to 30)

Hope its clear now.

good night

Hi LvMMT,

For trailing stops & BE, I like to use an adjustable % of the daily ATR.

For bigger time frames like 1h & 4h, something like 1% to 1.5%

on 15m to 30m, I like 0.6% to.75%.

Then breakeven at .6% to .8% of daily ATR. But BE is + 3 to 5 pips to cover cost.

Agree, be careful, protect your capital with SL but at the same time don't be afraid. When you place your SL and know your risk it's much easier to control your emotions. If a trade hits SL, there will be always many other opportunities.

Hello LV , thanks for the good system you provided. I used this system for binary options 6 or 7 years ago and I wanted to tell my opinion about this system to. This trading system has a high winning percentage and can be trusted. Trading conditions should be such that you lose less and can win more. To do this, we have to place the stop loss above or below the high or low, and if we lose, we should not stop trading and take the next position in the same currency pair, because the market will compensate our loss. Even if we lose twice in a row, you can be sure that all the losses will be compensated the third time. For example, NZDUSD today the first position lost, but the next position gained and compensated. With this system, you can earn %1 or %2 per day if Used properly.
But only use for currency pairs.

We are here to help improve each other's systems and trading types.

Good luck.

Thank you very much, but unfortunately I do not have any photos from previous years because I was not taking photos of my trades at that time. In those years, I worked in binary for 5 months and then I entered Forex and my system was the same, but it was a bit more advanced because there were 6 channels in that system and when the price hit the fifth or sixth channel, 90% of the time. It comes back and I make a profit but your system works the same.

After 2 years, I changed my trading style and left the indicator altogether until today.

Today, after many years, I ran your system on a chart to see its accuracy, and it was great.

I will try to find that system and show it to you here.

And about NZDUSD today:

Simple stuff:

Do ... Wim Hoff breathing exercises

every night ... just before you fall asleep ...

BEFORE YOU MEDITATE ... IN FACT ...

Theoretically ... cleans and refreshes the airways ...

But ..sure ... take away the anger ... (breathing exercise)

You become calmer

You alkalize your blood ...

so those who are not invited may also leave ...

(I mean viruses ...)

...

another method ...

I HAVE NO PREFERENCES FOR CHEMICALS

use a 3% hydrogen peroxide concentration from the pharmacy

put water 3 times its amount (3 TIMES YOUR BOTTLE OF OXYGENATED WATER)

(distilled water ... if you made at home ...)
not from plastic bottle ...

(some use "mouth water")

OR WATER ...

that is, dilute it to 1%

TEETH WASH ...

gargle ...

wash IN your nose too
rinse well ...

...

if you don't have ... hydrogen peroxide and / or "mouth water"

wash your nose with "tap water"

which has chlorine

chlorine kills .... life ... in general ...

don't exaggerate ... and don't abuse ...

try it and see if it works for you ...
if not...

search until you find it ONE SOLUTION ...

.....

if you don't have any tap water ...

at least vegetable oil ...

PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH

hold it in your mouth for 5 to 6 minutes ...

(20 minutes recommended ...)
DO NOT SWALLOW IT...

spit it out ... throw it out of your mouth ...

rinse well ...

...

these things can keep you away from that disease ... virus ... etc ...

WHAT CAN KEEP YOU REALY SAFE ...

IT'S LOVE ...

MAINTAINING LOVE IN YOUR SOUL

MAINTAINING THANKSGIVING IN YOUR SOUL

24 HOURS FROM A DAY

DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN FEAR?

ANYWAY YOU ARE NOT IMMORTAL ON EARTH ....

PLEASE BE HAPPY ...

IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS FOR YOURSELF ...

PLEASE...
DO IT FOR:

YOUR CHILDREN

YOUR WIFE

YOUR PARENTS

YOUR FRIENDS

YOUR PET

=> => => => WHAT THE FACT IS

PURE LOVE

FOR YOURSELF

WHICH IS

This is my profit for the last 4 days trading this system. What I’ve noticed that trading this system it needs to apply proper money management and the system is just as a guidance for taking trades but it is great and it works. I don’t think that for this system is possible to apply hard rules for every trade except SL. I normally trade liquidity zones and my trading this system was more or less based on that but in addition applying target bands for the direction. I guess for us traders the main goal is to be profitable and it doesn’t matter how we trade. Thank you LvMMT for introducing us with your system! Have a nice weekend to all!

I did not sleep

and my wife kept me shopping all day for the end-of-year vacation

I'm exhausted

I have a formula that gives me energy

their juice

4 oranges

1 lemon

I specify that I do not sell anything

I'm just telling you it's something that works great for me

search the net for this Gel from this company Forever

Forever gel

I used to drink 30 ml of that classic Aloe Vera

it tastes bad to me..

after which I drink another 2x 30 ml of Mango Gel or any other fruit I have at home

I tell you that this gel is extraordinary and hydrates the tissue more than water ...

water hydrates only 3 levels..

that's just theory

consume this gel with confidence and see the results in a maximum of one week

if you do intense sports ... if you are sedentary ...

does not matter

try it and you'll tell me

after Aloe Gel...

I use oranges daily

normally 8 a day and 2 lemons

required 4 oranges and a lemon for one day

Believe me, this is a very powerful medicine

it works even after a day of alcohol

after alcohol drink only oranges fresh  ... as much as you can

up to 4 liters per day of juice you can ...

I drink 1 or one and half liter of orange fresh...

try it

I don't give medical advice

it works great for me

============

another one high energy pump:

2 bunches of fresh parsley

lemon juice

a tablespoon of honey

in blender

============

I wish you a pleasant and loving weekend

Hello Tronis. How are you?

Thanks for the report you sent, but a few questions,

What percentage did you earn in these 4 days? And has this $ 729 been a profit for these 4 days? What was your balance? And please indicate the losses as well.

I only traded with this system for 30 minutes yesterday and made a %1 profit and I no longer had time to continue, and it is interesting to me what percentage of your profit did you make in these 4 days?

Thank you.

Hi cdk1212,
I don`t understand your request: you ask for beeing able to hide the "HL MTF"-button as shown in the left upper corner of Livios screen?
If so...the indi has a "Hide"-option...also its possible to put it into another corner....

Hi Livio,
I tried as you described...but can not see any change in the behavior of the indi...mmhhmm
Nethertheless again many thanks for your engagement here

Billy & Jim WET DREAMS
Hi Liviu and all,this night I dreamed  of some trading days of the last week...woke up in the morning, had a breakfast, bathroom...then at 9:00 (UTC+1=London open) to the charts.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)
Began to open every chart (28 pairs) to find setups .......oh, there are signals in pair xy...quickly open a trade, setting SL and TP....and going again to the buttons tofind more setups (knowing that the London open session offers most liquidity besides NY open).Having looked to all the forex charts its about 9:20...quickly checking the running positions...some walking towards profit, some still hesitating....some moving against me...Mmmhhmm, some pairs had wonderful signals to enter, but have already gone when coming to the chart...entry is to late now...Mmmhhmm, some positions should be watched concentrated to close them before reaching target or stop loss...But no time, as there ares still some markets to check for potential trades as Gold, Crude Oil, Indizes, Bitcoin...damn...time is running against me...Having checked all the markets its nearly 10:00....stressfull...not satisfying....in my dream I am drenched in sweat...But than....there came a chart from the horizont....nearer and nearer...and I was able to realize it....it looked like:
Market Overview
Distance to... in PipsMarket.....Price....M/H..........M/L.....W/H....W/L...and so on....ROUND.No100...HRN50....FIBO 79...62...38EU..........1.1355....236..........123......65.......33...............GU..........1.3230....122..........344.......5.......128............UJ...........1.1370.....498.........211.......76......233........................................20Gold........1805........100..........10.......55........231.........Dow.........35.454.....534.........231.......77......287.......................................................................15and so onand so on.
And now....in my dream....it was sooo easy to see in one view where to watch...where to wait...where to actI felt relaxed...knowing I never would miss again any opportunity....and the profit came in
Than i woke up and recognized: it was just a dream
Have a nice sundaydoerpn

The mind ... this wonderful "machine"...

Einstein had a recurring dream with some electrocuted cows ...

this later helped him with the theory of relativity ...

Sewing machine ... also in a dream was created ...

there are many inventions created in dreams ...

rather ... they found the solution in their dream ...

Jim Kwik talks about some morning routines how to remember what you dreamed ...

It's wonderful to dream.

A. Einstein

"Imagination is stronger than knowledge"

Copy paste from Google

He said imagination is more important than knowledge, because knowledge is limited, but imagination encircles the world. Knowledge will get you from point A to point B but imagination will take you everywhere.

for demonstration purpose only right

use only one ...

only the one that works

for me... both work ...

I think you got me wrong...yes, each of them works for itself...

but to draw current lines with one of them and previous lines with the other parallely is not possible. MT4 only respects the settings of the later installed indi of both....

thus there are only shown the current or the previous lines...

I thought you offered  your "(1)"-Version in post 354 to make this possible....

Hi Aliens,

I was posting here almost every trade, my SL always was very small so RR was at least 1:1 or higher, preferably higher. I was posting almost every trade here so everybody could see my profits and loses. I don't think that the account size matters for this test. I think what matters is absolute and maximal drawdown and not in $ but pips. I think the max drawdown in pips was around 40-50 pips. I've started this test with about $500 and 0.5 lots per trade but I was ready to add some more if needed and for some trades I used smaller size because of SL being further away. I normally trade with bigger lots and that's why I didn't want to trade such as 0.01 or something like that but to add some money to this test account if needed. The total profit for those 4 days was $619 (110 was the deposit). I attached the stats. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi Tronis,

respectable results...wow...great....

As I see in your trade report, you entered a lot of markets. Would you mind telling me/us how you check the pairs to get overview about the best entries?

Thanks a lot.

Have a nice night.

doerpn

--- 帖子 #363 ---
The most profitable trades were entered from target bands on 1H timeframe which had larger RR but I was also playing with other timeframes such as 4H, 5 min or 15 min hence so many trades. The smaller timeframes also works but not from any level. I was posting trades which I took from 1H timeframe. I mentioned before that I normally trade liquidity zones and all this trading was based also on my everyday trading. I wasn't taking blindly any pair or any trade when the price hit the target band and reverse but also based on my own experience. I can say that definitely Liviu strategy works and it could help avoid taking unnecessary trades for new trader as well as experienced trader. I like his strategy and I'll keep trading like this and I think that it adds loads of value to my everyday trading and thanks to Liviu. It's very hard to explain how I took the trades because I didn't use any hard rules for that. I was only placing hard SL on recent highs or lows.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hello dear Tronis, thanks for sharing the results.

I never asked anyone about the trade and its results, but you were different,

You, like me, showed everything clearly and did not hide anything in your trades. Some traders even hide their volume and I do not know why and it is very ridiculous.

Your volume has been relatively high, but these issues are not important at all, and as you said, loss and account management is important.

Thank you again for saying everything

I hope you have better results next week.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hey

I want to thank to Tronis, Aliens, doerpn, cdk1212 for the discussions posted today

I'm really happy and thank you very much.

I wish you a new week full of joy and full of green pips and very few reds.

I don't think I'll have time to interact so often until January 10th.

I promised my family I would stay away from the trading station.

I'm going to sneak in anyway ... for you ...

I'm getting ready to go on vacation.

I'm not sure if I'm leaving tomorrow or the day after...

From now on I wish you an extraordinary week, full of joy of love  and full of abundance

This week, if you hear a happy story, tell it to everyone.

If you hear a sad one ... forget it very quickly.

I wish you happy holidays!

God bless everyone!

Thank you.

I'm still a baby girl.

I do not know if it is good or bad, but it has been so until today.

Sooo right.....

--- 帖子 #374 ---
And for me...

family means people who think like me who help me or which I help ... those who feel like me ... who have the same values as me ...

not necessarily the one genetically related ...

It's simpler ... much simpler ... when you're alone ...

If you're okay with that ...this is what matters

I'm happy for you

Your "Alien" angel knows when a change is needed ...

What is best for us (for our evolution) is always happening to us in these moments ... Right now ...

I learned that nothing is good or bad (I still have to assimilate some things)

Hi LvMMT & All,

I have been playing around with your indicators and like the current setup. What I found is if you have a HMA on the screen and after the TMA+CG plots an arrow. Then wait for the HMA to be in the same direction.

This is how it all looks in the bigger picture trading this system for a week now. There is a big drop in balance pic due to $200 withdrawal. In just one week I've managed to earn $1000 profit on a small (about $500) account. Thanks to Liviu for introducing this system to us. It works great!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Wow, Tronis...thanks for sharing!

Very great work

Hope to be able to learn from your charts

Have a nice day

Hey folks,

Thank you for all your posts and for your great vibe!

Thank you:

Tronis, doerpn, kd1, kette, ForeoneX

I also welcome the new ones:

josip, Zakarh, sboy.s63

...

I see that some of you are aware of the reliability of the system.

I'm really happy for you folks

Others don't ...

ok those of you who are not satisfied with the reliability of the system ... look for another system ... my dears ...

you need to find your own system ...

the system must be similar to your personality ...

...

I have sent this system to many people and NO ONE ...

NO ONE told me that this system works ...

after that I concluded ...

it is not for their personality. Period.

(some didn't even bother to try it ... I'm aware)

...

our live account is growing ...

I took a transaction while going to the mountains

I was found to have mobile internet ...

my son tells my wife KGB ...

I think you realize why ...

....

I didn't go skiing because my son wanted to go to the pool ...

We often go to a winter aqualand with an olympic pool, jacuzzi, slides, heated water ... Hammam ... dry sauna ... etc ...

Today I sat at the outdoor pool ... with heated water ...

it was snowing a little ... splendid ...

I wish you all this experience ...

I took my "heart in my teeth" ... and I also entered the pool with ice cold water ....

He quickly got the impression out of my head and calmed me down immediately ...

immersed in cold water with ice ...

helps a lot the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) / parasympathetic (rest and digestion)

helps the immune system ...

but ... I was in a state of peace ...

did not last more than 20 seconds ...

....

I'll put some pictures for you ...

I wish you a week full of wonders and accomplishments.

God bless everyone!

Ours live account...

yes I know ... I know ... I wasn't 100% focused and I took the transactions a bit chaotically  ...

however, our account has increased ...

-11 degrees Celsius ... not so cold ... but you still feel it ...

see the explanations in the picture ...

You have to get in where the arrow is going down ...

and go under some plastics / rubbers ...

so you can get inside ... where the arrow goes up ...

everything takes up to 20 seconds ... if you don't make a mistake ...

but ... it's an experience that's beneficial ... even though I'm used to it ...

now i know what to expect ...

the legs stay in the ice water for the longest time ...

when you go out ... you really feel them ...

I'm grateful for that ...

I go underwater ... I think a maximum of 2 seconds ...

if not... a second and 0.00001 hundredths ...

for me ... it's very beneficial ... for my morale and body

...

I still can't convince my son to do this ...

but he runs barefoot through the snow ...

and he encourages other children to do this with him ...

he even has a lot of fun when he enters the hot water after a few seconds of running through the snow ...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I really recommend you do this ...

it's very nice ...

and I think it creates a little addiction ...

in a good and pleasant sense ...

God bless you doerpn and God bless everyone!

My russian neighbar wants to go with me into my pool in january....as he does every year....i promised to to so...after some drinks and now he tells me always that I had promised...
I will never drink again...I think...

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Find a solution ... something ...

You say ... the pool is ice ...

That it had an oil spill in it ...

After you do that ...

Drink with him one more time ... and tell him the truth ...

Don't really think before you do it ... just get in the water ...

... most people do not consciously influence their life ...

physicists ... those who practice quantum physics ... know that only we influence our lives and we create them ...

the one who doesn't know this ... he does this too (he influence his life)... even if he doesn't know ... even if he is not aware ...

if thoughts influence water ...

imagine what thoughts can do to us ...

(we are over 70% water )

thoughts must be supported by feelings

you can't think of a car (house ... girlfriend/boyfriend ...) ... without feeling like you own that car ...

the way we look at the world is the way the world looks at us ...

consciousness = awakening
self-awakening

if your life is devoid of joy, happiness ... fulfillment ...

it is ... because your attention is deficient on these issues ...

joy ... happiness ... fulfillment ...

if you are a victim ... you have to wonder if you don't have a victim mentality? ...

if you always have accidents ... tragedies ...

it's probably because your mind is connected to .....

that's life ... you have nothing to do with it ...

I want to tell you that this previous statement is very false ... very false ...

why can't you achieve these ideals>?

answer:
due to the fundamental lack of concentration

pay attention to where you want to be ... there to what you want to achieve ... and all your energy will be there ...

this attention needs ... training and repetition ...

daily...

... this is how your journey can begin ... being profitable in trading ...

That's what I wish you all for this year ...

be aware ...

be aware every second of your life

God bless everyone!

Hi All,

Happy New Year!

Managed to install a few files, but still so many indicators missed to install, window files would not install on my pc.

MT4 is not as easy to use, I have to learn many things, still not sure how to apply same set up on every chart or how to add main pair tabs.

Anyway, I will get there. MT4 indicator 'Fractals' I find it very useful, indicates highest and lowest.

Compared with IG,MT4 missing so many tools I got use too, such easy line drawings - point to point, delete button so on...

Created two candlestick layouts -

doerpn dear....

I'm trying to help dear ...

I'M NOT TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING ... SOMEONE ...

everyone is obliged to learn for himself ...

I think ...it's natural ... for everyone ...

let's use our brains ...

what doesn't work for us ... WE MUST forget quickly ...
what fulfills us ... and what helps us ...

we keep ... we innovate ... we reinvent ...

everything i do ...

are personal choices ...

AND I ASSUME THEM ... period ...

don't give up ... fight ... until you become the way you want to be ...

or you work non-stop to become what you want to be ...

or you complain because .... you know ...

nothing works ....

today ... they have to recover what they lost in the previous days ...

it's a big trap ...

but...

you can make tons ...

my goal is to give back the inspiration I received here ...

God bless you and God bless everyone!

Hi LvMMT,

First congratulations about your strategy.

Unfortunately your EA BillyJim is not working for me with the default set...so I don't understand the logic

Maybe could you post another set ???

My idea about this strategy is the following:

TF 1 H (or 4 H)
Buy when dot of TMA + CG Mladen TRP DREAMTRADER2 is below the bottom line of target bands and the bottom line of SHI Channel
SELL when dot of TMA + CG Mladen TRP DREAMTRADER2 is above the upper line of target bands and the upper line of SHI Channel

If the price is going against us, the EA is adding a new trade at next signal of TMA + CG Mladen TRP DREAMTRADER2

The trades are closed at next opposite signal.

Maybe your EA is working like that ?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Welcome here minella

I explained that EA does not trade alone  ...

it just helps you navigate the MT4 options faster

idea about this strategy...

Use TMA tapes the way you want

In principle, bar 1 should be closed over one of the lower TMA for Buy

and

bar 1 to be red below the higher TMA

watch out for SHI Channel

be consistent with TMA

Que Dieu te bénisse et te protège minella

God bless everyone!

Hi LvMMT, thanks for sharing and contributing to the trading community. Took a look and decided to give it a go. Tried the TMA bands a while back without much success. Let's see what happens here. Whatever happens, happens ! Right? No worries. Anyway I took an EU short at the top of the signal bands. 2nd H1 candle after today's Sydney Open. SL about 12 pips TP at 30 pips.

One quick question. Is there a seperate setting for the white (lower / inner)) signal band? I assume signal the bands need to be applied to the chart 2x, 1x for the orange outer band, and 1x for the white inner band? (Inner white signal band settings please) Maybe I missed something in my reading? Thanks in advance.

There are 6 buy positions.

When price is above the upper channel, the buy positions are solded

and a new sell is triggered ...solded and a new buy..

and so on...

Is it possible to make an EA with that ?

Welcome here bobby2!

Please note that the SHI SIGNAL ARROW does not update in time ...

if anyone has time to do it I am grateful

if not ... when I have time I'll do it

===============

when the bar turns from green to red,

is closed or not .... as you wish ...

is below the upper TMA band

Then we take Short

SL above the last green bar as you put it is very good.

Hi Kevin, the signal I mentiomed was the green arrow. That is the Shi Silver Trend indicator. I know it repaints. But it COULD, POSSIBLY signal a reversal or retracement. As you can see, price did eventually go lower, and would have triggered my TP, later in the European session. The template (edit: and indicator, sorry forgot earlier)on my chart are below the chart image. Hope this helps.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Aliens,

These bands don’t work all the time as they are adjusting a bit after the price has moved away but if you are combining with something else then it works. I like to have them on my charts. I normally trade without any indicators and I know that all indicators are based on past data and they will always lag. As I said I like to have these bands, not for my trade entry points but more for keeping me in order so I don’t take unnecessary trades.

Yes, you are absolutely right, bands do not work when the market is trending, but they work well when the market is range or sideway. And of course, %60 of the time the market is range.

Hello Kd1. When you want to trade GBPAUD, you have to look at AUDUSD first because they move against each other. Today AUDUSD was in the overbought and could go down and as a result GBPAUD can goes up.

And most importantly, the dollar is strong today and can pull AUDUSD down.

When you buy on USDCAD, it means the dollar is strong so AUDUSD can go down and GBPAUD can go up.

Goodluck.

Ok, guys  Lots of happy screenshots (most - after Alien's comeback) and I decided to try

1 week of trading this method: something near 50% win-loss - something near coin throwing

Now I just ask you friends not to tell me about "previous pages", "how the market works" etc. I really ask you to share your vision of the reason to use a pack of the repainting indicators. I'm not trying to start a holly war here - no! I just need to understand from this tread something more then "never mind if it just fills your pocket".

Thanks forward to those of your who could pay some attention to this my ask!

--- 帖子 #750 ---
What is it, on which system is it based, can you please explain it in more detail?

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Hei Tiroler,

it is a personal system. developed in over 12,000 hours of study.

I will never explain it here.

I posted this system (even if it's not a system, it's something to help you find your system) to inspire people.

I was inspired too. And again I thank in my heart  all those who inspired me. You can find them on the first page.

Take out all the indicators and watch a market non-stop.

GBPUSD, EURUSD, US30, GOOG, MSFT, etc ... which you want ...

Gold, Oil etc ....

ONLY ONE. ONE MARKET! IMPERATIVE!

M30 and H4

or H1 and D1

Or just one TF. Any TF under 1H, or just 1H, for daily trading.

...

Day and night. DO NOT STOP. In train, In car, In plane.

When you eat, when you relax when you have a free moment .... look at your chart.

That's it.

Look at this system too. You can find a myriad of things in your favor.

DO NOT BE RIGID IN THOUGHT.
BE INVENTIVE.

You MUST REALLY WANT IT!

Work ONLY with JOY in your soul , and you will have experiences

which you couldn't believe some time ago...

Those who try to exasperate you, send them only joy and love.

You will be rewarded as much as you can't imagine!

Consume natural foods and drinks as raw as possible.

Over 80% of your food should be raw. You will achieve a vibrant health and an unimaginable joy!

Dr. Robert Morse USA Florida, he lives today, the others are gone  Dr. Max Gerson, Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer.

This is my recipe for success!

However, the life of a trader can be compared to a life of a monk.

Those monks who are religious don't make me passionate ... I think religion divides everything into good and bad ... which I don't agree with.

I believe that This Force that surrounds us, wants only our good, but leaves it to us to decide.

I hope you will be inspired by my words, but know that you do not need inspiration,

YOU NEED DISCIPLINE => As a WORLD CHAMPION .... or as a monk ...

I will not post anymore ....

I have a lot to do for myself and my family.

I pray for those who are going through difficult times.

Regardless of the camp they belong to.

They are all human and they are all souls.

Everyone needs to be guided.

"Peace be with you!"

You only have love in your soul and you will be rewarded as you can't imagine!

God bless you Tiroler and God bless everyone!

Your answer is in your own words. Market move type

Most traders are front of the chart during the day and look at it and at the end of the day they leave at a loss. but why? There is only one reason for that

Over the years, they have given us tools to trade with. But in essence, these are the tools that the enemy gives us because we defeat them against them. This is

what they want.

They taught us analysis, but the market is not analyzable, and this method is a failure.

If we pay attention to the charts, a series of movements are repeated many times during the day and in some places prices react. It is enough to use these.

Professional traders realize that other indicators and analyzes no longer work in this market.

In this market, strategy comes first. Of course, each chart has its own strategy that we must find with patience and practice.

The reason why most traders lose is not having enough knowledge and not having patience and having a lot of greed.

For example, the same system in this forum can be very profitable, but we have to find a way to make a profit with it, and it is very easy if we have the knowledge to trade.

The body, the mind and the soul must be healed all at once!

If two of them start to heal, they bring the 3rd body to healing.

I think that's about all you need to know so you can start healing.

God bless everyone!

I strongly recommend this course:
Vipassana Meditation (dhamma.org)

It was recommended to me by a top CEO from a multinational.

He is forced by his superiors to do it at least once a year ... in India.

There are others who do it 30-60 days a year.

I will do it in June!

...

I strongly recommend this Book by Yuval Noah Harari:

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

I will read the next 2 as soon as possible ...

Noah Harari: Homo Deus

Noah Harari: 21 Lessons for the 21st Century

God bless everyone!

Good to see you back.

You smashing it! What an amazing results!

If this is real business, must be giving you incresdible returns, happy for you.

Channel indi looks like a  very great tool to have. If it is available I will dwl to try out later this week. Little stars on your chart are the same as previous arrows? Or is this completely new system?

Thanks for sharing info on healthy living, very useful.

Hello dear Jolita,

Thanks for the kind words!

this system helps me see swap levels,

you only have to look at one pair and only one time frame for a while.

it is necessary to watch until something is triggered that you trust.

this system has many uses.

just sit and watch. non stop.

I'm testing something new and I have some time these days.

I won't post when I'm busy.

the stars sometimes turn me on ... if you didn't remind me of them I wouldn't even notice that I have them in this template.

forget about them ... ( even if we want to be one of them  ... LOL)

or you can only use them without tapes ...

I will share everything I find useful about health with people with health problems.

1) anyway ... fruits (ripe and organic) in the first place ...

2) herbal tinctures for the endocrine glands and for tissues.... we need them every day ...

3) salads and some vegetables ...
4) and of course ... fasting ...

maybe twice a week steamed fish or seafood ...

but the most important thing is THE JOY OF THE SOUL ...

God bless you dear Jolita and God bless everyone!

Hey everybody,

... to write codes, it takes a long time ....

Please  understand that I don't have time.... for this...

someone asked me to help him with some codes ...

so I chose to share the codes with you too

I learned to program myself ...

so you can too ...

it's very simple., but it takes time

here are many useful things,
https://www.youtube.com/c/Jimdandy1958

is this FF user
https://www.forexfactory.com/jimdandy

so I'm not a specialist ...

everything I do, I do for myself and it works ...

if it doesn't work for you, it's not my fault...

look until it works for you. don't stop looking.

I have no responsibility for this EA

this EA is for education only

please.... please test it in demo

this EA does not trade alone....

if it has any problems I fix them but that's it have not time...

please understand

thanks

I think Jolita recommended me this T721 user to me for coding

I did not use his services.

you can try.

if you download it ... please like it, this is how others can download it!

Hi LvMMT,

Hope yoy are well.

Yes I can recommend to contact T721 if you are willing to learn various  trading techniques.

He has lots of great educational material on offer, shared via Telegram group. He exchanged  excellent  trading tips with me even made an hour long trading video on Fib retracement which I am thankful for. Thanks T!

He is generious and very experienced  trader who is more then pleased to help others achieve best results at no charge at all.

I don't think it was me who mentioned T is good at coding, as I think he is  more technical trader, perhaps he knows someone with coding skills. Don't know.

P. S There is a thread on  FF coding any indis.

Thanks! J

Disputes are an outdated tribal mentality.

I think it's time to forget about the tribal mentality.

Here you will take block if you do not respect these lines.

Be inventive, tolerant and understanding. We are all in the same situation.

I accept people's behavior, but not in my house if they are trivial.

Say positive and constructive things.

Aren't you tired of being treated the same way?

I invite you to listen to these videos.

Keshe Foundation Spaceship Institute - YouTube

Find out what GANS is, how to cure GANS human diseases, in fact, do not cure, they process human disease and make them perfectly healthy. Search on YouTube.

Find out what is MAGRAV on YouTube, how this wire system relates to the human soul and emotions. Incredible.

These people are developing free technology and are / have been stuck everywhere (they seem to have found support in Africa), Ghana is now exporting high class technology to Europe for the first time. Incredible.

The Europeans wanted to kill them. 4 attacks....He reports on this.

They were threatened with death by the masters,

western imperialist power because they do not want to give up the power obtained through theft and abuse and murder.

I don't have time for these childhoods,

if you have some free time, learn something for yourself and your family to make your life easier and more beautiful

don't pay attention to others who feed on your atention... such as those on social networks ...

You'll be sorry someday, because you're wasting your time ...

read and watch ONLY WHAT YOU LIKE ... very important ...

learn to disconnect from all 2 hours a day and meditate, that is, stay alone with yourself  with your soul, even if the mind tries to take you back to trading  or various tricks ...

I think one of the most beautiful gifts a person can give to another person is: HIS TIME!

Aussi  please stop inciting, share what you trade and what is useful...

I'm interested in live or demo. The demo made me great without paying anything. I am very grateful.

I read a new book ...

Jessie Inchauspe => book: make your glucose revolution

The girl with glucose ... that's how I remember her ... LOL

she is French but lives in the US

She says if we change the way we eat ... we lose weight ...

the thing has already been tested by someone I trust and has been tested for more than 3 weeks ... she says she will always use it ...

find more tips in the book ...

1

she says to drink a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar diluted in a glass of water and wait 15 minutes before meals.

2 We eat vegetables for the first time. A salad or a raw vegetable is a must. It's very important. vegetables can even steam ...

3 proteins and fat

4 carbs and / or sweets at the end

5 movements 20 minutes after each meal (no sports ... walking something ... easy cycling ...)

Because muscles immediately use excess glucose

He also says that if you still eat a lot of sugar at a party, something ...

to drink another glass of water and a tablespoon of cider vinegar ...

That is, the effect is observed in 2 weeks.

It has an immediate and incredible effect.

That is, we are no longer hungry between meals. It's about not having a peak of glucose burning inside us. Which generates a lot of free radicals. They have an unpaired electron and look for that paired electron and wreak havoc on the body.

When glucose remains in the blood and lymph, it sticks to protein and is called glycation. This is how these free radicals are born that burn everything in their path and destroy everything.

she explains ...

For the first time, raw vegetables "line" the upper part of the intestine, so the foods that come are no longer a priority and so less glucose is assimilated at the end of the meal...

She says to eat the predominantly salty and sweet breakfast at the end.

Ex: Egg salad with bacon with feta after that cereals etc ...

That means we keep the goods all day and it doesn't make us hungry in vain. It also helps with sleep if the whole meal of the day is saltier ... or with salty foods ....

this for those who still consume animal feed ...

... personally I recommend a lot of fruits .... their juice ...

without carbohydrates ...sometimes  fish and seafood..sometimes eggs in water ...

green salads and root juice ... carrots celery beets ...

many apples .... many oranges ... their juice ... don't eat the fruits ...

they contain cellulose ... our body finds it difficult to digest this cellulose ... it is a hard structure ..

grapes ... juice or blender ... with shells and seeds ...

only grapes for 7 days ... up to 35 days and even 60 ...

melons only 7 days ...

only oranges 7 days .... up to 35 days and even 60 ...

or distilled water ... 7 to 10 days ..up to several ... 21 ... 42 ...

it's fantastic ... you won't believe it ...

I held up to 10 days many times ...

one day 2 or 3 days out of a week I fast ...

every week...

if you want to eat more meat ... in time you will discover that it doesn't help you much ...

(fruits and vegetables contain ONLY distilled water in addition to other elements that are ORGANIC ELEMENTS ... FEEDING ... Living Foods ... spring water contains many INORGANIC ELEMENTS ... H. Coanda realized that people who consume water high in calcium (inorganic calcium) ... they leave this world faster ...)

when we eat a lot of processed foods we need a lot of organic calcium ...

sesame seeds contain large amounts of organic calcium ...

forget about dairy ... and cereal ...

lots of fruit juice ... salads ... fish ...

much changes inside ... and in the soul ...

if you have any cravings ... you have to do them

give up potatoes ... especially in combination with meat ...

Tomatoes cooked in any form are great producers of mucus ...

this is not medical advice ...

God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #798 ---
this answer is for those  who ask me in private what I do ...

I work NON STOP ... that's what I do ... because I don't feel like I work .... I really like what I do ... period.

you have to watch the charts NON STOP .

just one time frame ...

for a long time ...

a year and a half ... 2 years ... minimum ... 3 maybe ... whatever it takes until you start earning ... it doesn't matter how long ....

THIS IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS ... one of them .. .

some start to discover quickly others later ....

just look at chart non-stop ... a single pair

try everything you think works ....

test everything ... absolutely everything ... MA RSI TMA CCI etc ...

it's good to know how it works ...

but they won't help you more than 50% ...

just look at the chart .... NON STOP

when you eat ... when you have free time ... when you have a wife shopping and waiting in the car ....

DO NOT STOP

when you start to realize ...

you will have a heart full of joy  and gratitude ....

all the information will come to you as you begin to understand ...

you can't have all the information if you don't understand ...

all the change has to do with the change inside you ...

there is no other way.....

God bless everyone!

what don't you understand ... they all have the same Tp ... even if they are above or below ... and these TPs will turn into SL ... for some ... for those in loss well understood ...

if you don't understand this ... I think you still have to study ... that's what I say ... maybe it's not mandatory ...

thanks LvMMT for the reply,

I think you are more expert in this field ( trading with no S/L ) --- anyway.. it would be more interesting if you provide knowledge to the world about the RISK of trading without S/L, I will appreciate those who failed with the reality more than dreams that never come true ( and that's a fact ) because most of traders blow their accounts cause of averaging and trading without S/L

waiting for more red screen shoots from you, we can learn together all here to fix that problem

Hello I just came across this thread. I basically trade futures. Has any one tried this MA indicator for futures? Thank you

Hello Wavegarrick, I just came across this thread and find it interesting. I was looking for someone who has tried TMA indicator for futures as I am trading futures and I found your comment here. If you do  not mind would you share your opinion about this indicator on future. Also which instrument you tried on. Thank you for your time

... my weekend book (or book of the week) Joe Vitale => The Attractor Factor: 5 Easy Steps for Creating Wealth (or Anything Else)

it's a great book ... it's about our interior ... not about wealth ...

when we have a balanced interior ... we can create everything we want ...

a book that must be read for those who want personal development ...

the only purpose in life ... isn't it personal development? ... isn't that the goal? would we become better versions of ourselves?

that's what I think ...

Please help me if you know about open orders on MT4 "Off Quotes"
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Anyway, I'm waiting for an answer from my brokers.

when I have to increase the lots ... to recover a transaction only then it blocks me to be able to place the transaction .... LOL

not even manually allows me to make transactions ....

if I restart the terminal .... it works ... but this is not a solution for me ....

Did I demoralize them a bit? ....

I am grateful if you have a viable solution.

to change brokers ... I know and that's what I've changed in the past ...

I wish you all a wonderful day!

God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #879 ---
I made a print screen from the video and sent it to the broker. I had to crop the video because I have something personal in it. I didn't realize ... and I had to crop up ... that's why it looks bad ...

here is the video how I press the button to sell and it doesn't take my transaction ...

https://filetransfer.io/data-package/Vbq6NJEz#link

....

I have a Leverage account of 1: 500

and he tells me that in the news period ...

"Leverage is limited to a maximum of 1: 200 just prior to high impact news releases for new positions."

what I don't understand is how it doesn't work for me to enter the transaction if I have Leverage 1: 500

can anyone help me with an explanation?

What should I do? to change my leverage? in a split second? IOL

... change the broker ... it's the only solution ...

God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #880 ---
My broker was clear about this issue. My account manager told me that i have leverage of 1:400 other than commodities and crypto. I have 1:100 on commodities and crypto. There is no restriction on trading during news event.

This is how God work!

"To be or not to be, dope, that's the question

Are you gonna stop or keep on rushing

For the better, quicker than the next man

To be the best is the master plan

Go on with all you've got, give it your best shot

Don't ever think about trying to stop

Keep reaching, pushing, hoping for perfection

Make up your direction, don't ever stop for a moment

Prove you want it

If you got it flaunt it and get up on it

Go for yours, not for a minute but for all the time

You better so it cause I'm going for mine

Go for it, that's right, heart and fire yeah

Go go go, I see it in your eye

Go for it, heart and fire

Go go you've got to go for the feeling

It's time for the rhyme of the bold and the gifted

Listen closely and you'll get lifted

Higher than you ever been before

Get more than you bargained for for sure

Life can be a trick for of trouble

But you got to stand up and fight back double

Don't let nothing hold you back

Yo when life says stop you say go go go

Reaching, growing, teaching, knowing

Is that a preaching that each and every one of you are blowin

Get youself together, keep moving

Don't let nothing stop your flowing

Go for what you want, don't hold back

Cause I know you got the knack

So go farther than you've ever been before

I'm going for mine, go, so go for yours

Go for it, that's right, heart and fire yeah

Go go go, I see it in your eye

Go for it, heart and fire

Go go you've got to go for the feeling"

Afternoon, been reading this thread for a while and came to the conclusion i would like to try it out.

can someone sum up the latest files since I've seen some updates come by and would by difficult to collect all proper files.

Author is it possible u make a .zip including the needed files and with strategy details in 1 place i think this would be collective for new users easier to follow the setup too.

rule number 1:

need to want enormously to become profitable

rule 2

to work as much as necessary for rule number 1 to manifest itself in your life.

I don't use indicators anymore...

but I have used and tested all of them which are the most praised. I'm done with them...

test it in parallel... so you can see

still draw vertical ...horizontal lines...

but only what goes through your head... not what I or others say...

if you do this long enough to change your paradigm...

you will wake up thanking God and you will have a heart full of joy...aaaa..... and of course the account full of lots of money...

I started with The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle's .....I listened to it on YT....

I couldn't believe what I was hearing... I had other beliefs/paradigms...

after which I read

The Shadow Effect: Illuminating the Hidden Power of Your True Self

Book by Debbie Ford, Deepak Chopra, and Marianne Williamson...

another blow to your beliefs and self-understanding...

after which I started to search more, that is, to read and listen more....

I read and listened to everything Dr. Joe Dispenza  wrote...

I have the impression that this man was cataloged as one of the people with a very big impact on humanity...in the first 1000 people who had a decisive role in changing people...or even the first 100...I don't have the exact information but for sure to many they opened their heads...so to speak...to understand how the mind works...the brain...that we live in a body of drug addicts....to which we are our own dealer....LOL

if you have beautiful thoughts... the brain creates a cocktail of beneficial substances for your body...

if not.... throw only venom and poison into the blood...

it's natural to start listening to your thoughts and emotions to start dealing only good drugs yourself...LOL

That God  that I keep putting in my posts...is in all of you. It is pure love. He doesn't know how to punish.

You just punished yourselves...and as usual...blame someone else....

Who is close at hand that you cannot investigate, investigate...see...hear...

it's God ... he punished me... because I did who knows what stupidity...

I tell you honestly... it's stupid to think like that...

I repeat...God is in you...it is the vital energy that sustains your life...HIM is only pure love...

IT DEPENDS ON YOU IF YOU WANT TO WAKE UP OR LET OTHERS SLEEP YOU...

LIKE THE CHURCH AND/OR RELIGION OR WORSE

MASS MEDIA...

this is where my journey began...awakening...

trading has changed me enormously….

it showed me first of all that I wasn't capable of trusting myself...

I was very changeable...stressed...without knowing what is good or bad...

the answer to good and bad lies within you... but through the development of intuition, not through the development of thinking...

the mind is not able to lead you...

if you let your mind rule you, you become its slave and become full of fears and depressions...

only intuition can guide you...this develops only when you are convinced...only convinced...that there is something near you permanently...which is also in you and which only wishes you the best....

are you able to accept it ... ?  LOL

only you have to answer... only you can change and only you can heal yourself...

only you can do this work...ONLY YOU...you come alone...you are always alone...you leave alone...(that is, without another person really by your side...)

it's your journey... but you always have God  by your side...

now I know this and only when I say these words am I full of joy and gratitude

only then will you become full of love and understanding for yourself and others...

if these lines don't help you... block me... because I might bother you again... if you come here to see me again... God bless you!

read listen read listen ..again and again....

choose only what you think will help you develop in any field...

internet is full of very good quality information...most of the time...for free...

I am grateful every day for this and always when I remember...

come here and always read this when you need...

God bless everyone!

Possible you can post some live trades while we learn?

--- 帖子 #949 ---
i always post what i trade...

not entirely... because...

...

honestly...you have to figure out for yourself how it works....

it's only about you and your evolution...

it's not about money...LOL...money comes after...

me...  very many times... but very many times... it happened to me...

to lose JUST because I was paying attention to money...

...

I wanted to be able to trade with great joy in my soul...that is, to win and be very happy at the same time...

I think I succeeded...

to know and feel every movement in ANY KIND OF MARKET...

clearly I only smell a few...  but I have the ability to develop systems for any type of market...

no news... or other fumes...

these are to manipulate and scare...that is, to steal the money easily from the suckers...sorry for the term used...

...

it is very important to want to evolve...

if you want to evolve and do everything for it... you will be AMAZED...

money, profitability... come when you are good with yourself...

and not only these are coming...the loving family is coming...respectful and affectionate friends...and many more...

when you start to accept that the loss is just a simple attempt without the expected result... you realize that you haven't reached where you want...

I'm repeating myself now... I'm just saying the same things since I opened this topic... but I'm saying them in a different way...

search deep within yourself... you see a lot about feelings... that's where thinking starts... and not the other way around...

when you change...or when you are already changed internally...

psychologically speaking...

God  will give you signs  that you have made the right choice or that you are on the right path to manifest what you want...always and always...and always...perpetually...

You will be amazed when you realize the "synchronicities"...as Carl Joung called them...

however...

I'm waiting for others to give their opinion here...

only I speak and only I give lessons and only I show how to trade...

it's easy to ask... it's hard to give clear and reliable information... already experienced...

all people need the same things... no work no wasted time...

there are shortcuts...but you have to find them yourself...

I'm not writing for anyone in particular...

I write first of all for myself... so that I don't forget...

and I am also writing for those who did not have access to such information...

...this is it ...

it is only about you and your evolution...

God bless you smeden and God bless everyone!

it is mainly based on carrot and apple juice...there is a recording on YT with him ...where he says he can cure ANYTHING...

he has done it many times....his daughter  (they are both deceased) ... said she cured all breast melanomas. ..which she treated...in the clinic in Mexico...

anyway, if you don't change on an emotional level (this means that we must forgive ourselves, those around us and our past.... simple...)...the diseases come back...stronger...unfortunately...

must always be quoted and told to people what wonderful things carrots do...

...Further...

we in the family do this:

5 carrots

a small red beet...or medium

a lemon....(try a frozen one...)

put on the slow juicer...

...

now it's grape time...

I recommend another recipe...especially for your boy...but also for you...

to a liter of grape juice...

(it is important that they are black and have seeds)

put the juice of a lemon...

at 8 in the morning at 12 during the day and at 4 or 5 maximum... in the afternoon...

a liter of grape juice with the juice of a lemon... at each of these meals...

no other food no water...

there are people who have been cured of countless diseases...among the most serious...

there are many testimonies...many many...

6 weeks if you can...without other foods...

heal many...many many things...

I've been using it for a long time in the morning...after I come from sports...

mandatory after sports I drink either a grape juice with lemon or an orange ... 1liter...

it will cause some disturbance in the intestines...in a good way....

Definetly will try, love beetroot and black . Beetroot gives you iron, very good for your blood and heart.

Black grapes is one of my favourite grapes, now in season.

People here add ginger to healthy cocktails, but I am not a fan off ginger, will add beetroot instead.

Figs are in season now, very good for your body. Eat as many you can.

Keep safe and healthy!

stop writing in PM so that I can help you with transactions...

I am not responsible for what you do...

is not my business...LOL...

read and learn...

maybe it will take you a few years...

but what you learn stays in your head forever...

you can do what you want after that...

please stop writing...

WOW...

the idea is to be inspired... that it is possible...

you have to want it and not give up until you succeed...

great work LvMMT. I have read through the thread and it seems you are not using the system you start with. so, what method are you using or EA. thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #990 ---
this system is very good...is extraordinary...

just sit and find the strong points...

it's awesome...

i can make infinite money with it...

just wait and watch until you understand...

I kept repeating this...

I won't say word for word...it's childish...

anyway, I bet if I say so... there will be some who will not be able to make money with this system...

everything depends on your inner world...

I hope I made myself clear...

I won't say what I do ... I have a very profitable system ...

all you have to do is change inside...

and stay and analyze the market...

when you discover... your heart will be full of joy...

to know that that feeling... is God...

you will take my words for granted...

the merit is only yours...thanks to the love that God has for you...

if you believe what I'm telling you, you'll succeed... if not... you'll come back and read it again and again...

some of us learn quickly others harder...

the more you change internally... the more information you will receive...

you can't change suddenly...

the change takes place between 2.5 and 5 years...

God bless you Isaba2 and God bless everyone!

i am thirteen years away from pharma doctors already.

blood circulation is the key.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
this answer is to understand...not to scold someone...I want to show them that it is natural to help people...not that they are not interested...

I can tell you for sure that you only know half of the answer...

if you only studied at the state university... or similar to what is taught at the state university... or did a doctor tell you that...

without delving into how pills kill people...

I'm sorry to tell you this:

I know many...many cases...even in my family  when doctors kill people ...

because they think they are right...because they have learned...

they learn to sell pills... and that's about it...

surgery and those who deal with bones...can help...but not always...

emergency medicine...can help...but kills on the conveyor belt...

but they are blind...that's how they want it to be...

I suggest you study with shamans/healers/doctors who really heal...

you can read about this man who worked for the biggest pharmacies in the world...and he says what they do...and he says that the shamans cured him, not the pharmacy and the doctors...the doctors only killed some parasites inside him. ..that's all they could do...

so study...don't give up until you understand what you want...what you need...

everyone has to discover the truth for themselves...Ph.D. Alberto Villoldo,

there are also doctors who heal... but naturopaths or who know a lot about nature...

some of them don't want to say...

it's not just about blood...blood feeds the cell...exactly...but who do it detoxify?

the lymphatic system...modern medicine hides this...

so the correct answer is: good blood circulation and good lymph circulation...

I don't have anything personal with anyone and I don't get into polemics...

this is my opinion formed in years of research and learning...

...end...

God bless you oo7rai and God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #994 ---
the post above has been edited...so refresh...maybe you caught it unfinished...

thanks for understanding...

search until you find the answers...

God will always give you access to information ... as much as you can understand ... do not access what you cannot live or understand ...

only if you want ... and if you search until you find ...

so...

it is natural for each of you to search for the truth alone...that's the only way God  will show himself in your life.....

find someone to love you...that's all you need...after that...you will move mountains...

God bless everyone!

yes to me, the physical matter (body and blood) is functioned/ pushed/ overridden by non physical mind (soul) and spirit (oxygen).

if the quality of blood and quantity of oxygen is enough then every part part of body is alive.

any dis-comforts in mind (soul) may become dis-eases in physical body.

outer reality is created and projected from and by the inner soul (sub conscious mind) - the virtual reality (physical dream) would be stopped or the soul will vanish when breath (oxygen/ spirit) can no longer push the blood in and around body.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
mind (soul) over-rides matter (body/ body) but spirit (breath/ oxygen) must exist there is like software coperates hardware but electricity must be connected with the computer.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
I see you are using a good VPN...I am not interested in this...

I think you are confusing a lot of things...

mind with soul...spirit with oxygen...

please be careful what you write...

God bless you oo7rai and God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #998 ---
yes, it seems that my statements may confuse a few things.

for example; the word 'spirit' is the word derived from latin word 'spiritus' or breath or oxygen or prana

and another word soul is the inner mind/ child/ god or the sub conscious mind where all meanings and or difinitions are imprinted.

you are not interested, it is ok for me that you initiated the topic and i tried to add some of my understaning and practices.

I answered here earlier...Cable Update (GBPUSD) | Page 34982 | Forex Factory

maybe someone is interested in how to quit smoking...

I smoked for 35 years... I quit after reading and listening ... Allen Carr's book... Finally a non-smoker... The easy way to quit smoking... that was the title in my native language...

...

it's just about addiction...powerful drug addiction...it's the 2nd most powerful drug in the world...legal...drug...

but...

the first time when I started to read it...I left it...because I was afraid that I would give up cigarettes....what nonsense...

I started it again after a while and quit smoking...

I was listening to the passages that I liked...that made me move away from that misfortune...

...

for me the cigarette was one of the best friends... that's what I thought... what nonsense...

now....I've been without a cigarette for many years...and it's amazing...

by the way...

alcohol is legal... but it has a lethal dose...

if you drink a certain amount of alcohol...you die...

there are a lot of substances that do good...and are illegal...which do not have a lethal dose...

I hope it helps someone...

God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Hi LvMMT, without doubt you have put a lot into creating and managing this thread and I commend your effort.

It's just my opinion that you will  be doing so much to humanity if you only can turn the light on, in the way you trade. I think the only reason you opened this thread is to contribute and empower people to become more and make this world a better place? Your words on your trading style are vague and leads to undefined destination. There are support  and demand zones on all time frame, do you look at higher time frame for this levels and switch to lower time frame, do you put into consideration a candle stick formation for reversal or continuation of this trend, is there a particular market open you prefer to the other that makes this set up valid, there are so many questions to ask. You will be doing us all a favour if you can explain how you go about your method, thanks.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
I keep repeating... but I see that you all read only what suits you...

Hi LvMMT, I am not here to judge or troll you and if you feel angered by my words, I am sorry, I do not mean it. It's your thread and your knowledge ( your intellectual property) you can share it with who ever you wish to share it with, there is not problem with that. The only clause is you share your amazing result without giving a clue of  what you do, which is dangling the carrot in front of the camel.You may claim to be inspiring but I see it more as inducing your readers without a path or organize knowledge.

If it's your close associate that want to begin it's journey on the forex market, wouldn't you cut down the time and stress by showing them some nuggets to ease their journey? Thanks again for contributing your quota to this wonderful community. I promise not to comment on this issue again.

this answer is for G... who thinks he needs help...

only you can give your help... don't look outside yourself for answers... because there aren't any...

Hello,

listen....

if you are depressed...it's a blessing...

only by touching the bottom of the water can you come out into the light...

this gift is given to you to evolve...

if you don't evolve... you basically condemn yourself to stagnation... and implicitly to regression... to non-existence...

try to read the mystics (or better listen to books) ...

if you think it's stupid... you'll have a lot more to suffer...

probably some need more suffering to be able to wake up...

I don't teach anyone to trade...
EDIT: ( if I ever do it...it will be for a lot of money...very very much money...exactly...)

everyone needs to discover the truth for themselves...in trading...but especially in life...

remember what I'm telling you...
the Being...God...will appear to you...only in silence...and in a state of self-satisfaction and gratitude...

when you have problems... it's a turning point in your life...

it is a gift that you will be happy about only after you see yourself fulfilled...

I know people who started trading in demo...for years...but they got cured of depression..this was the way...

when they were trading...they didn't care about problems anymore...that's the key...focus on what you want...and not the other way around...

when they did ...they went live...and made tons of $

in trading...you must not listen to anyone...

you have to take the bull by the horns...or the bear by the tail...alone...alone...

inspired by others...but do the work yourself....

when you will understand the advice...truly...in your heart...you will have a heart full of joy...this will happen after you are healed...

God bless you G... and God bless everyone!

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
I have a list of books ... grab them immediately ... they are almost all free on the net ... don't waste a second ...

if you don't do this ... the road will be more difficult ...

close any mass media source...

only books...which you think will help you...

just what you want...but don't deviate from the mystics...don't deviate from your goal...

this is the most expensive advice....

I found a book that simply amazed me...

by Rudolf Breuss (Author)

The Breuss Cancer Cure: Advice for the Prevention and Natural Treatment of Cancer, Leukemia and Other Seemingly Incurable Diseases

I kept looking on the internet for people who knew this cure and I found a lot of people who did it successfully...and they cured many diseases caused by us...through our diet...which more and more more appears in paid ads...

the book has a few pages...under 100...it's something unimaginable...

this cure says that it cures all diseases in 42 days of fasting with the juice of certain vegetables and some teas... tea mixtures... it's all explained in the book...

they will tell you that it causes malnutrition...or who knows what idiots the doctors will bring out.....(not all are idiots...only those who don't want to investigate...or those who want to hide the truth.. .there are not a few...)

unbelievable... how things are hidden...

God bless everyone!

I'm telling you honestly...for lung diseases...infections...inflammations...

use crushed cloves...before any meal...45 minutes before...

it works wonders...see how much you can bear... .

start with 2-3 cloves...I use cabbage juice or orange juice...you can find it already grated in capsules...but the volatile oils disappear...

Cabbage juice contains a lot of hydrogen peroxide...

I mix them with a little wormwood and dill seeds...

I don't think you need to take them for more than 2 weeks.. but for me they take effect in 2-3 days...

read and make the combinations that make you feel good...

honestly I tell you... it works better than anything...

It's a strong antiparasitic...

if you don't know, read Mrs. Dr. Hulda R. Clark was a Canadian naturopath...

she says to take them in the morning and in the evening... and in combination with black walnut tincture and wormwood...

I take them before every meal... 2 weeks...

Secondly, to show incredible results and say that you don't want to teach anyone, it's a meaningless thing, probably just filling a void in his personality.

If I had something good, I would try to give it to others, even knowing that the vast majority will not learn much, but that is my way of being. After all, this is the purpose of ff, that of sharing knowledge.

my knowledge is worth millions of euros...maybe hundreds...I earn non-stop...for a long time...

I think I won't post anymore...

here on the site I asked ONE TIME ONLY someone for information in private... that's all...

I learned the rest by myself...

NON STOP work...

aaaah. that person didn't even answer my question... I found the answer by myself in an hour I think... just looking at what he posted...

.....

don't come here to give lessons...if you don't know what you're talking about or you're blind...

Adios...

God bless everyone!

Hi Liviu,

I was not very active on FF in the last years, but I came across your system

and tried what you adviced: I took one pair an watched it for two months

as often as I could... and it MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE in my trading!

I want to thank you for that! This exercise is really helpful to see

and "feel" the market behaviour. With your hint to look for S&R and

Supply/Demand I was able to be profitable now for three weeks in

an row. I know that is not a long time, but I never had such a good

"feeling" for the market.

I think you showed us a lot. Many, many thanks!!!

And I would encourage everybody to make this exercise before criticising

the system!

Sorry for my bad english & green pips for all

dear Wido24,

thanks for the post and the kind words!

please believe me that I gave this system for free privately to many people. Some didn't even bother to say a word to me...

it's very useful.

I'm happy for you! Sincere!

Try to find your way!

And in trading, but especially in life!

Believe what I tell you...

Read the mystics ...

seek the truth... both in trading and in life...

stay and observe the graphs... and you will see a lot more...

only in silence and in full concentration will God  show to you...

your successes are Divine inspiration...

not that God whom the priests call God...

it's that Quantum Field that is Consciousness...

a single Consciousness...that manifests what you are...always...

but it's always by your side to love you and guide you to the better...to the better ....

be careful what you feel....you get what you feel...

and what you think ... but especially what you feel ... what you are ... that's what you will get ...

the rest...is Can Can...

P.S

I just saw your post...

God bless you Wido24 God bless everybody!

Put a teaspoon of dry Sage (Salvia officinalis) in half a liter of boiled water and let it boil on low heat for 3 minutes.

Then take it off the heat and put it in a mug. After boiling the sage for 3 minutes, take the container off the heat and leave it for a while, then add a little Perforate St John's-wort and Melissa officinalis for flavor.

Leave to infuse for 10 minutes. Then, strain the liquid for drinking.

...during boiling, at that moment an active enzyme is released which is very important for all glands... spinal cord and discs...

...for these reasons, you should drink sage tea every day, for the rest of your life.

...if you do this, you will rarely get sick again.

tested and guaranteed...

God bless everyone!

2 absolutely incredible books...

it's something everyone should read...

especially teenagers... at the beginning of the journey... and not only...

will change your paradigm...

The Manipulated Man

Esther Vilar (Author)

Thank you Simon,

in the book I sent you, you will find on each page, the link to the site where I got it. You find many...many books you need....

thanks to our conversation, I will recommend some more authors on my thread.

the ideal is to do only what you want, in every moment, WITHOUT JUDGING OTHERS, (neither good nor bad)...

BE AWARE OF YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU DO, but...

BUT...ONLY WITH JOY IN THE SOUL....THIS IS A PART OF WISDOM...

be happy for no reason...exactly...every second be happy for no reason...

THIS WILL LEAD YOU TO ENLIGHTENMENT...WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE...

BUT YOU MUST DO THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER....

DON'T LOSE IT... BE VIGILANT...

AND BE CAREFUL WHO WRITES / REWRITES YOUR SUBCONSCIOUSNESS...

IT IS PREFERABLE ONLY YOU....

God bless you Simon!

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
inner speech... is perhaps the most important...

you change it into positive thinking...that is....

you think about what you have to do only with joy in your soul...you are very attentive to what is creeping into your inner speech without you wanting to speak or think that thing...

so I repeat...

the false self...the personality...infiltrates in the place of the true Self...in your place....this mind does...it wants to be in command...but it is only a follower...

YOU. ..ONLY YOU ARE THE MASTER...YOU ARE INTUITION....not your mind...

exactly at that moment when you bring attention to those negative things... they lose their power... and immediately think about what you have to do, ONLY ABOUT GOOD... POSITIVE THINGS...

and slowly slowly ... you will God appears in you...He will appear in your life through things, events and/or emotional experiences that you wanted...He only appears if you can perceive Him...only if you are like Him.. .to some extent...

so I repeat...

I accept and I don't oppose...

I turn inner speech into a paradise

I am always vigilant so that my attention intervenes on the present moment so that I know for sure that the mind (false self...or personality if you want...) does not infiltrate and start a dialogue without us that is not mine....

i always do this...every second...

and changes will occur...sure sure...

we cannot receive wisdom if we cannot understand it...

the idea is that we are all identical from certain points of view...

close everything that doesn't please you...become a monk in the world...not in the mountain....live every moment with joy in your soul...don't judge....and you will receive wisdom....

some need years...and I needed that...this is called the Way of the Cross...others just need to read and change...

the idea is not to give up...never...

make your plan....visualize it always...always...always...don't judge anyone or anything....accept whatever...(your journey to accept it...however...you you also created these events)...

don't be sad about what's happening...it's part of the understanding...

you will repeat the mistake....a million times....why? because you didn't understand...when you will understand it....you won't do it again and you will move on to other more complex mistakes....Love you!

that's part of wisdom...

God bless everyone!

the idea is that I ended up trading very well just by advancing spiritually... or I don't know if this word is appropriate...

I lost millions of transactions...I repeat...millions of transactions...

at first it was terrible...for years...

but... at some point... something happened in my head and I stopped thinking like most... I thought differently about trading and that's how I became profitable... very profitable...

the idea is that you have to forget everything... just look at the graphics... and use whatever you want... until you're fed up... and you'll take something else in turn... until you're fed up... .

but... but don't give up...

so...

many symbols..or few...but I repeat...only what you like...what you feel you want...but don't give up....

and I repeat...

I'm kidding...I won't repeat it...I said it all...

When you understand what I said here...it doesn't matter what you think now...

make others understand this too....

it's about you...what you're reading...it's not about someone in particular...

Love you!

God bless everyone!

authors who changed me into something much better...more joyful...more aware...more loving...

in the order that I prefer:

Neville Goddard

Jidu Krishnamurti

Ilie Cioara who is a local author...from Romania...I don't know if you can find it translated, but he explains that Ramana Maharshi...maybe simpler...

Osho

Ramana Maharshi

Nisargadatta Maharaj

Papaji

Ramtha Judith Darlene Hampton

Eckhart Tolle

Rupert Spira

there are many more... I kept saying some of them here...

but if you start with these... something in you changes... and after that it will also change in trading...

you see the market as you are...

important...

if you think what I'm saying is wrong... please forgive me... or don't forgive me... I forgive you and I respect you... on a certain level I love you...

the idea is that each of us evolves at our own level...

if you're in the pit...you'll come out when you're tired of staying in that pit...and if you don't come out...be happy...and the King of kings will pull you out of the pit...that's all...

Love you!

God bless everyone!

Hi LvMMT! Thank you for your efforts over the years. God bless you.

I use Trading view for my charting, and I was wondering whether you have the indicator for trading view?

Alternatively, do you have the manual moving average settings?

Thanks in advance

No tradingview for me...only for viewing ...not for trade...

I don't use the bands anymore...

I use MA but not to trade just to view...classics...

I think there are delayed entries with MA...

I'm not going to talk about trading...it's everyone's journey...

Bless everything, because you are blessed!
