The RSI This set up is based on an article written in Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities. The article was written by Hadi Seyedinajad. Mr. Seyedinajad uses the RSI mostly for exits, but I found it to work well for trade entries. I use the RSI for counter trend and trend following trade entries as well. I have been trading this set up for the past four weeks with good results, even in these choppy markets. The rules are very simple and all you need is the RSI on a 5 minute chart. I only day trade the EUR/USD with this set up. I do chart and watch the Fibs and major Support and Resistance. The set works very well when at price consolidation. It can give an early indication of the direction of the break out. I use the RSI to make my trades entries. Draw a trend line on the RSI, from the most recent high (or low) and wait for the break to enter as a counter trend. I also use the RSI as a trend following entries. When the RSI bounces off the trend line, I can enter the trade. The key here is to see the long term chart to determine the best use of the RSI, trend or counter trend. Of course as most of us know, the RSI divergence can be a great trade as well, so do watch for divergences. In later post I will show the use of Fibs and the micro trend use as well. Again the set up is very simple: EUR/USD only 5 minute chart 21 period RSI Enter/exit based on RSI Trend lines 20 Pips for stop loss and trailing stop for profit target. Move the stop to break even as soon as you have 10 pips and keep trailing. I have used the 25 trail stop. Don’t trade this set up ( or any set up!!) during major news Don’t widen or remove your stop. Okay, here are some examples: (This is my first post and I could not post the explanation next to the pictures. This is the only way I could this work. I hope it make sense) This is an example of consolidation market. The RSI gives early indication of the breakout.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
This one did not work very well, but if the proper stop/trail stop was used, you would have been out with some pips or break even. Second chart: Choppy but the RSI would have kept you short longer

--- 帖子 #3 ---
RSI divergence that worked well second: The RSI could have kept you in the short trade longer in choppy markets

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Two possible trades, both counter. RSI would have got the most out of this trade.. Just stay in as long as the RSI does not break the line A divergence that did not work, so don’t get too excited and keep your stop/trail stop in place This one worked and told you when to get out Another divergence, with a good exit. Many opportunities to enter/renter this trade. Divergence and exist

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Many chances to enter and a good exit.

14 day with 20/40/60/80 levels work well. Bull runs 40/80 with support around the 40. Bear runs 20/60 with r @60

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Need to bust through 60 band

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I have a RSI ebook should anyone be interested in RSI study http://api.ning.com/files/YirimPE49X...ermination.pdf

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Regarding your first picture. Wouldn't it be the same if you just trade a normal trendline break on your chart?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Yes, I would look to get long on a break up but rsi does a pretty good job of showing divergence.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thank you Bunton. I like your post.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yes, but many times I noticed that the RSI trendline break leads the price trendline break. Plus the RSI tends to have less false break outs.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Daily chart notice first retest of the 60 band short

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Kareem, thanks for posting this strategy with RSI. This remind me the strategy of Ghafari, fx analyst who uses a triple ma cross for entry and RSI for exit on higher timeframes (H4). PDF attached. r.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks, nice artical. Yes many use the RSI trend line for exit only, but again I found it to give great entries as well.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
How to trade this

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I have tried this set up with the EURUSD 5M chart only. Any feedback on other pairs would be great.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi Kareem, Give this a read.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thanks Dopey, interesting artical.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I was thinking the same. Utilizing normail trend lines as well as pivot points ... will give you a better view of price action direction and use RSI(21) to confirm that direction. Using RSI levels 30-70 and applying pivots, support &amp; resistance, trend lines ... you can see or expect price action direction on the chart and on the RSI indicator. Blue dotted line is our pivot point and the colored lines are our support and resistance levels, obtained daily using the pivot point formula. Here are a couple of notices: Price action breaking or bouncing off S/R &amp; pivot levels RSI(21) shown breaking or bouncing off the next whole level For example: take P/A move just before the time of 14:25. P/A sits on a purple S/R level, RSI sits on the 40 level. P/A rises and breakthough green S/R level and stops at the brown S/R level. At the same time, RSI moves up off the 40 level, breaksthrough the 50 level and stops at the 60 level. It did just the same as price action. Now im not saying this method is perfect, because it is not. The point im trying to make is, by using the RSI and Pivot Point/Support Resistance level, can give a trader entry, direction, target, and trading goal. Also, on a quick note, consider using Quarter Points within your S/R levels. Quarter Points are the middle point of an S/R level.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Drawing trendline on an indicator is discreationary.It is almost impossible to program it,I spent too much time try to define the rules precisely.İf someone codes it please let me know.Anyway,this is how I draw trendline manually on RSI : RSI&lt;40 Strong down trend RSI&gt;60 Strong uptrend RSI&lt;50 Strong sell RSI&gt;50 Strong buy RSI between40-50 weak down trend RSI between50-60 weak uptrend

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Check this link, ways to use RSI similar to this thread..for anyone interested http://www.fxstreet.com/education/te...008-06-11.html

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I do use the S/R lines as well and will post them in the near future. I will also show many trades where the RSI is leading the price in trend change. Thanks for the feedback.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I gave up on an EA long time ago, and yes drawing the trend lines can be an art(subjective) sometimes. Making changes in the RSI trend line can sometimes give little more(or less) pips, but the idea still effective...I think. I will also show in future posts that the longer trend lines give different results than shorter trendlines! Thanks for the feed back.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Here is an example from Friday to show where RSI can lead in trend change.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Long

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Live example

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Got in long on the divergence, the RSI trend line shows a strong up trend. can exit as the RSI crosses the the trend line again. Also price stopped at a good resistance level where we had a daily and a weekly fibs. That would have been a good target as well. I was out of the trade on a trail stop with 36 pips.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Here the RSI broke the trend line. If you were long, you should exit ( good 30 pip profit), if flat a short would be a low risk trade. Again 20 pips for stop loss.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Dear friends: It seems that you draw the trend line in the history chart, not real time I tried your method today, it seems difficult to dermine the trend line points Could you please give me some sugestion. Regards

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I use the the RSI live in a free chat room. Of course I am not claiming that it works most of the time. I do and you will get stopped. My intial numbers show about 65% win ratio. Its a low risk trade and with the proper money managment this method can be effective, as it shows you how to ride your winners. Again I draw the line from the most recent high/low and watch the RSI either break it or bounce of it.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Here is a trade from today. I got out with a 45 pip profit as its my daily goal, but it did go for more. Got in trade because of the divergence and the RSI kept me in.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I see a nice 4h divergence in e/U

--- 帖子 #35 ---
A picture is worth a thousand PIP.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
It even shows on the 60 minutes

--- 帖子 #37 ---
60 minute chart

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Here is what I was looking at off 4h

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Here is another break

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Interesting. I never saw that. Of course I don't look at the 4H much. Thanks

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Here are two trades earlier

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Kept going up

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I took the exact same trade. Still going strong. Great setup. Rob

--- 帖子 #44 ---
It was a nice one. Exit again could have been the two Fibs or the cross back. either way it was a nice one. Thanks for your feedback Chicago.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Made two trades last night on eurusd. Both were winners. One was a big winner. Looked at the chart this morning and could see all kinds of possibilities. When I see a sideways, ranging condition and the indicator is "flat," I put a put a trendline on the top and bottom peaks, to creat a channel. Whichever way price goes, I'm ready for a breakout. Thanks for presenting this on the forum. Rob

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks for your post Rob. I glad to hear that you doing well. And you are right I also found it to work best as markets are in consolidation. The RSI seem to be lead one to two minutes ahead of the price. Please do post some of your trades when you can.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I'll post the two I made last night. Once these things start going, get your TS rolling and watch the pips start to build. Rob

--- 帖子 #48 ---
A break of the trend line here would be a good short.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
K40, great job with what you are doing here... One question. I've noticed you have "macd" set up on your charts also. Is there relevance in executing a trade with the macd coupled with the RSI trend indicator? Mike

--- 帖子 #50 ---
RSI broke before the price trend

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I am adding different indicators once a week. So far I have not seen anything that could improve on the RSI trendline break. Just trying new things. If I see anything interesting I will post. But so far the MACD had no major effect. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I have limited experience with this approach , but I don't think anything else is needed. I like the fact that it gets you in at a better price, which helps if the trade goes against you. However, if someone can add an indicator which will help to eliminate false signals, I'm all for it. Rob

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Here are two trades I took yesterday. Plenty of profits for one day.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks for the charts Rob. I opened three trades today and got stopped at break even at all three. So I am flat for the day. Also I notice that you are using the RSI 14 period. I found the 21 period to give you less false break out. You might want to try that. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I'll check out the 21 period next. It flattens out the peaks, which makes it a little more difficult to get a nice "line" on the trend, but if it lessens false breakouts, it'll be a good thing. Here are two trades I just completed. Got out WAY too early, but there's nothing wrong with a guaranteed profit. I find the entry signals to either precede the move by one bar, or match the entry bar, so this surely helps with setting a breakeven point, if the trade goes the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Nice ones Rob. I missed those today. I am still at zero pips. Good solid entries. I am glad you are doing well. Kareem

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Another one, RSI lead again.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks K40. Amongst my winners, I have had only one loss, which was $2.00, and three breakevens. I find that, even with a failed breakout, I get enough action out of the first breakout candle to at least get in a decent stop. I want to keep it tight, since I'm not interested in watching price fluctuate for several bars - it either fails and hits my stop, or it breaks out. The one thing that makes it difficult for me is the spread. I only track four pairs, since IBFX has jacked around the spreads to the point of absurdity. I'm with them only because I also trade several EAs that require 1-cent pips. For the RSI trendline system, I would be much better off with a decent, low-spread broker. Rob

--- 帖子 #59 ---
That's exactly what I mean about breakout candle momentum. You could trail that one candle and still make some pips. Rob

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Still going

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Just took this one. Made some nice pips.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I used IBFX before, so I know what you are talking about. I use AMP's Ninja platform. Their spread is also high, but I do like Ninj. Again I am glad that you are doing well.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Indeed, I am with you on this one. My first pips for the day. I got 30 pips out of this one

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Takes some getting used to. I don't understand where to start a trendline from. How far back? Is it subjective, where person A sees it one way, person B another, and person C another? Or is there a way to know?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
here's a chart with two RSI windows. One that I have lines at 75/25, and the second window where I drew in my own red lines to show a channel where the EUR hasn't really exceeded in some time at 67.4 and 34.8 (Almost like fib lines). I took the short trade when it hit the 67.4 line &amp; we'll see what happens. Am I on the right track?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I look at the most recent high/low, the swing. Your trend lines seem to be too long. Again this is good for short term counter trend, and its good for 20-40 pips. Of course sometimes it runs and give you lots more. Just go over the posted charts again. Thanks for the feed back

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Here is a recent example. Again expand your charts and start with the most recent change( low or high)

--- 帖子 #68 ---
would make a nice short

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Interesting...scrolled back on my chart and see that the EUR/USD hasn't exceeded 75/25 for days, and almost immediately when it hits those marks, it reverses. On that trade I made, I made 10 (got stopped out, but it went as much as almost 30 pips in my favor). Looks like all someone has to to is wait for it to hit 75 or 25, or even a little less at 65/35 &amp; simply wait for the reversal? Can't be that easy, though. What am I not considering?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I put 20/80 on my charts, but still trade mostly the trend line break. In trending markets it can stay high/low for a while. This set up works, just keep a 20 pip stop loss and move it to break even at 10 pip profit. Its a good set up, because its simple. Just try it for a couple of days. Of course no news trading. Nothing works there!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Yes, I was aware that the RSI is traditionally used as an 80/20 fror overbought and oversold. Just lokked like the EUR was in some sort of zone at about 65/35. Probably temporary, but was looked like that sort of thing could be capitalized on while it lasted. For the life of me, I can't get this trend pattern thing. I'll figure it out if it takes me a year. Maybe you just have to get close, and no three people will draw the same lines.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
This is a short-term strategy, so just grab some recent swing-high/swing- low points and connect them with your trendline. Look for downward angle on the peaks, for your long breakout, and a upward angle on the peaks, with a trendline on the bottoms, for your short breakout. When I see consolidation, I draw trendines on tops and bottoms, since it could break either way. After you've looked at a bunch of charts, it'll all start to come together. For me, the hardest part is managing the trade. It's certainly the most stressful part of the experience. Good luck with your efforts. Post back with some of your practice trades. Rob

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks for the post. Good explination.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Interesting idea Paradoxical. I will look into it. Thanks for the post.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
this morning

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Got stopped on this one.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
That's what I mean about taking advantage of the candle's momentum. Were you able to get your stop at BE on the big bear candle? Rob

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I got a bad entry and ended up with the full 20 loss stop. Today might be a hard day to trade. New RSI trendline is forming. I will keep watching.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Not seeing much with the four pairs I monitor. Price action is mostly sideways with small candles. I may draw upper and lower trendlines on these and see if there will be any breakouts. Rob

--- 帖子 #80 ---
This would have been really nice, if I hadn't missed it. Oh well, there's always another trendline forming.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Not sure if it's luck, but seems that lately the EU stays in about a 35/65 channel, and when it hits either line it bounces off. A demo trade I made was down over 20 pips at one time, but within about an hour, it went back up at the red line.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Forgot attachment in previous post.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Kind of like channel-trading the indicator. I see you've got Firebird running, too. Mix and match! Rob

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Just took a short on EU about an hour ago after it broke an upward TL. Only had a stop of 12 on it but that was enough. Moved it to BE after +6 and was looking for it to hit that 46 line on the chart. 66short closed at 48 for +18. Nice system.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I did notice that today. Will look at it for few more days, as today was FOMC news day. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yeah, I have too may charts open, and the firebird runs off a 5 minute also. I just discovered the firebird &amp; trying out different methods with it. The channels are of a different system, where I use an EA invented by a guy named nanningbob to only open trades at extremes from center, such as 80 to 120 pips away...a counter trend startegy.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Nice trade James. I have tested many stopps and find 20 to work best, specially in the choppy markets that we are having now. Thanks for your post and please feel free to ad more post/ideas in the future.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
What's firebird?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
At the risk of being off-topic, nanningbob is one of the smartest guys we have, here. I've read about his EAs and they are quite impressiive. Rob

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Chicago, You know what the firebird EA is. Just started trying it, but not that impressed, so will probably can it. Basically, it relies on pullbacks for entry. The EA I mentioned created by Nanningbob is very similar, and his first EA would buy and sell at the same time, and capture profits on a pullback. For anyone interested, the current EA allows you to set a distance away from the 40 Moving Average before the EA will enter. For instance, you would take a SELL trade if the EUR/USD was 120 PIPS over it's 40 MA, and the EA can be set to make further trades if it keeps going against you.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Seems to still be in the 35/65 range and bouncing off. I made another 22 pips on the bounce off the line. Now, going back down to the line again. If it goes under, and then starts to reverse, I'll try another trade.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I am watching it today, there seem to be a pattern there. I will look at it for a couple of weeks post some trades if I see them. Thanks again, great post. Kareem

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Got sicker than a dog last night, so I stayed home today and watched my charts. Made some pips on this one. There was another good setup before, but I missed it.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
This one was good for only 20. Hard market to trade today!

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I got 35 out of that one last night. I hope you feel better soon. Kareem

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Good job, K40, on that trade. You squeezed out some good pips on something that doesn't appear to have much momentum. One thing that's hurting my performance are the crap spreads at IBFX. When I get some more trading time under my belt with the RSI Trade, I'm going to transfer to a broker with lower spreads. I'd love to go to MBTrading, but I'm not sure I'm betting enough on my trades to pay the commission costs. Rob

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Just took this one. Hoping to see it go past the last swing-high. If not, I'm already at BE, plus some pips. This should pay for my lunch at McDonald's tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Same trade. Love watching the momentum when they break out. This will be enough for my lunch and a three-pack of chocolate chip cookies.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Yes sometimes pips are hard to get. I hear IB has the best spreads, even with the commissions its still worth it. I also hear good things about MB. I glad you were able to get some pips today. Kareem

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thanks for the good wishes on my illness, K40. I'm pretty knocked out, but I have a job, so it's back to work tomorrow. EURUSD isn't really a problem with IBFX, since it's usually 2-pips, but it jumps around quite a bit during different sessions. The problem is that I use other systems that trade different pairs, which can end up with prohibitive spreads. By IB, are you referring to Interactive Brokers? I traded stocks and options with them for a long time. So so service, but a great broker with super low commissions and killer executions. They really spoiled me. Rob

--- 帖子 #101 ---
The morning news made friday next to impossible to trade. I tried one trade and got my 20 pip stop. I am hoping for better opportunities this week.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Nice thread, kareem40. I use a 13 period RSI but will add a 21 period to check out from Monday.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I noticed that the 21 gives you less false break outs. Thanks for your post

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Here is an example from this morning. Notice the major trend, which I use with 20-30 stopps and wider open targets. The minor trends within the major trend can give you 10-20 pips and again smaller targets. Everything I am doing is out the 5 min chart. I have not seen good results with the smallter time frames. Kareem

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Here we see both micro trend break has easly given 10+ pips with only 10 SL. I am still waiting on the break of the major trend line. Of course a bounce of that line, would confirm the trend and give us a long signal.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
The third minor trend line forming.....you get the idea.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Of course we are quickly reminded that nothing works most the time. Respect your stops and keep them. We would have been stopped here.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Second trade with this system, bought at 38 and out at 52, +14 when it stalled. Stop was set at lower support, 10 pips away.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Nice trade James. Thanks for the post.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Here is a divergence from this morning. The RSI told me to stay, but I booked my 40 pips and I am done.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
RSI said stay, I should have. Of course I still very happy with my 40 for the day.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Dont really know what just happened on the EU but not complaints here. Was long on rsi break @55 with a stop of 12 pips. It went up 9 down again and then popped, got +60 on this one moving my stop to the red lines as it whizzed by. (i've got TL's , the force 5min and the DOW to work with this)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Yes James, I saw that one. It was a nice one.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Nice trade. How do you use the force 5m with the RSI set up?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Kareem. I have been using the rsi since I started 2 years ago. I must have tried 20 different mt4 variations. I keep coming back to rsi14 with 45/55 lines. Don't trade inside them unless holding onto a position already open. But have you tried a linear weighted 21 moving average placed on the rsi. It more or less does away with the need for a trend line and reduces the trouble of where to draw to and from. Check out the eur/usd m5 and m15 today. It doesn't repaint but as with everything wait for the candle to close once the rsi has broken the 21 average line. I would post pics but don't know how to yet. Andy

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Great post Andy. I will try and please do post some pictures when you get a chance. As for the LWA (21) is that the average of the price on the RSI chart, or is it the the RSI LWA. Thanks

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Great job on your trade. I would have taken it exactly the same way. Rob

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks for your post, Andy. Definitely post some charts, as this sounds like a extra improvement. Rob

--- 帖子 #119 ---
One thing I've noticed, after my RSI trades unfold, is the momentum of the candles at the breakout. This is a great opportunity to get your stop in at BE. As I've said before, I'm not interested in hanging around, watching candles go up and down, hoping they go my way. I tend to put my stop in tight, and concentrate on the trades with good momentum. I want to thank K40 for putting this on the forum. So far, this is the best system I've used( and I've used many). I see trades like this all day long. Love the simplicity of this approach.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi guys. I'm off to work now (still doing a couple of days each week for a friend plumbing). i'm not that techy so perhaps you could let me know how to post a screen shot on here and i'd be more than happy to do so when I get home tonight. I'm in the uk so it's 8.00am here. The lwma is from the moving average in normal indicators (not custom indis) on mt4. drag and dropped onto the rsi 14 window, set to 21, shift 0 and applied to the previous indicators data. Then on the rsi I have levels at 30,70, 45,50 and 55. If the lwma is broken and /or a trendline on the rsi I still wait for the 45 to break and hold for a short entry. Chicago rob , you mentioned momentum. Look how the mom really gets going once these 45/55 levels are breached. It sometimes has a small retest of the level once through it but goes off really quick. I find it saves many false entries when all the ma's on price and sometimes price action itself gives you an entry the 45 level just says hang on , wait a bit. See if you see it like I do as we're all different. Off to do pipes now. Andy.

K40 - I also use RSI crossovers along the lines andypips describes. Here's a chart I just made with the following RSI comparisons (it's a 233 tick chart, so the bar times are between 4 and 9 minutes right now) - please also note that I have scrunched up the price bars to allow a clearer view of the RSI variations : Subgraph 1 : andypips RSI 13 with a 21 LWMA (actually, I'm not entirely sure that I have correctly plotted the LWMA, but I think so...); horizontal lines at 45 &amp; 55. Subgraph 2 : my version of the Fozzy RSI (if you remember the Fozzy thread) - RSI 8 with 8 SMA (the orange dotted line is a 21 SMA). Lines at 30 40 50 60 70. Subgraph 3 : "your" 21 RSI + trendlines . Lines at 30 &amp; 70. Subgraph 4 : my personal favourite, Igorad's StepRSI. The dotted red line is an 8 RSI; look how smooth the step lines are. Lines at 32 50 68. NB. I also use the cross of FastStep (cyan) over the 50 Centreline, dependng on the market's "mood". Also note that these are not the default StepRSI settings. The two vertical yellow lines show the cross of this thread's 21 RSI over a trend line, for comparison purposes. Food for thought : what are the advantages of manually-drawn trend lines (this is to consider, not to suggest, the answer, which of course is personal to each trader) ? I think manually drawing trend lines is a very good discipline... the question is where on the chart window to draw them ! I am experimenting with these RSI variations quite intensely at the moment : it is my intention to "fix" my indicator window by the end of this week (too much fiddling is not good...). J. Edit : I'm fairy sure that the LWMA in subgraph 1 is incorrectly plotted (although it looks effective !) - I need to cut and paste the code directly into the RSI indicator : as I am a very slow (non)programmer &amp; am too lazy to start up MT4, I am going to wait for andypips to post his chart. Sorry about that.

Thanks for the kind post. I think you have a good idea about the BE, I was thinking about that recently since I have been having lots of BE stop right before the price goes my way. This set up has been very good for me. It seems to work and it stays simple. By the way, if you watch in longer time frames such as 60, 1H, 4H, it works the same, you just need bigger stopps. So if you don't have lots of time to watch the markets, just use the 4H and reduce your position.

Great Post. Man I thought I knew the RSI. Many great ideas that will probably take weeks to stuy( live). My goal ( other than making 40 pips a day) is to have no more than two indicators, Fibs and trendlines for the price action. Again please note I also use the manual trend line to keep me in a trade longer, not just to enter. The hardest thing for me in trading is when to pull the trigger when I am making pips. Yesterday I was up 40 pips on a divergence trade. The RSI/Line said stay, yet I did not listen. once I took my exist at 40 the trade continued for 30 more pips. Again, thanks great ideas, please keep posting. Kareem

Me too on max two indicators : I'll be happy with the 34 ema + RSI (but in what form ). Two ongoing issues for me are moving my stop to b/e and how big a trailing stop to use (if at all). I am generally over-keen to move to b/e and get stopped out too often as a result. Likewise I don't like to trail more than about 20 pips, which is too tight to get many of the larger moves : I will try using the RSI support trendline as my guide. I also switch between trading in halves and thirds. Halves is simpler, but I generally prefer thirds, taking a small initial partial profit between 6 and 13 pips net, depending on the market, then trailing the third portion (t2 is usually a fixed target based on swing highs and lows). Sometimes I think I should just leave the third portion stop equal to my first partial profit, and be willing see the trade come right back to that point, allowing the possibility to catch the occasional 100+ pip move. No doubt about it, exits are my biggest challenge...

--- 帖子 #126 ---
This is what I do. I move to BE as soon as I am 10 pips in profit. I know it seems fast, but I want to have risk free trade ASAP. I want zero risk as much as I can. I used to use trailing stop, but not anymore. I hold the trade at BE and watch the RSI. I always have a target at 40 ( my daily goal), but will move that target and replace the stop at +40 and hold as long as I can( again based on the RSI). I also still working on exist rules, exists are really much harder to figure out than I intially thought. When I trade multiple contracts I take half at +10 and move the other half to BE and use my set ups again.

Another comparison, this time with the LWMA on the RSI data, which is what I understand andypips is using. Vertical lines mark where these LWMA trades might have triggered (is that right, andypips, or do you only short from above the 55 line and vice versa from the 45 ?) Edit : I see I missed some crosses...

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I see where LWMA gives you better entries. Again the exists seem too early, but it Looks good, I will continue to watch it. My problem now is that I have Ninja trader and I cannot get the LWMA on the RSI? I will try support help.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I am executing most of my trades via Ninja to Interactive Brokers, but TradeStation still has much more versatile charting. I think the StepRSI may appear soon (I have asked a helpful, but very busy guy on the NT forum to help...). I have found Ninja, both users on the forum and their own support staff, to be very willing to help with indicator prgramming. But looking at Ninja's RSI, it has a smoothing average already, so it's probably not at all difficult to do what I just did in Tradestation : exchange the standard smoothing average for the weighted version (in TS this involved replacing just one single "reserved word") : I will do this sooner or later if I decide to use it, but as you know the StepRSI is still my "main contender"... Now, if the EJ would kindly push down to the lows of the day (I'm short from 115.76, stop at 60)...

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Jtrade, Thanks for the feedback. Yes I have also found Ninja's support great. I have tried TS and they do have the best charting, but their DOME..??? Please feel free to upload any NT indicators you may find useful and I will do the same on my end. Good luck with the EJ, Kareem

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi guys. Lots of replies and stuff to try. Sorry no reply but got home from work late and family/something to eat etc. Just thought I would check this before bed(11pm here now). I will get some charts posted tmw as day off at the screens. Just a word on charts - I use broco trader mt4 charts on demo for free. All forex/indices etc that you can imagine and it never needs renewing. I then trade with IG Index. Also have a small ac with alpari and use their mt4 charts when trading with them. I only mention this because you can download from them in minutes and not need to worry about reprogramming indicators etc. I am no good at that and just keep it simple. See you tmw. Andy.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi jtrade. just a quick note then i'm off to bed. I guess being in amsterdam you are 1hr in front maybe. Anyway, I tried all sorts of trailing stops, position sizing, scaling in and out. None of it suited my personality. I like to be out of a trade in 2hours max and prefer 10 mins. I found that a target of 20 per day which may come in 2 x 10 was once my ideal. Then as the majors have started going nuts each day I got greedier and moved to b/even to get 80 or whatever. next thing stopped out for nothing having seen 30ish etc. Looking back 12 months if I had stuck to my plan of 20 and compounded I would be minted now instead of still working part time to achieve full time trading someday soon. I think I was convinced I would get where I was heading in 2 months and failed. I am now much more disciplined. I have spent a minimum of 6-7 hours a day on average 7 days a week learning this skill over nearly three years now and realise that sticking to one template and massive money management is king. I have a compounding spreadsheet I can post if anyones interested and 20 pips a day are all thats needed. Andy

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Good post, Andy. I'm still leaning towards leaving on part of every trade to pick up the occasional big winner, but instead of thirds, maybe I'll switch to 40:40:20 ... You're completely right about averaging 20 pips per day - absolutely not as easy as it sounds - with full size lots, the account starts to really accelerate...

--- 帖子 #134 ---
btw, Andy - you mentioned you do not enter positions on the basis of RSI / LWMA crosses between the 45 &amp; 55 lines : do you only take short above the 55 and longs below the 45 ?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Jtrade. If the rsi has crossed up the lwma below 45 then I would consider a long if the price action suggested it and vice versa. I would however be ready to move to be or stop for a loss if the rsi stalled at or in the 45/55 zone. Taking this as an example if the rsi along with price moving up has crossed the average but stops at 45 then as long as price holds up while the rsi pulls back slightly I hold the trade waiting for the next momentum push up through 45 then wait for 50(not so much) and 55 to break. If I have my points already then I'm out or move to +20 and see if it breaks the 55. If I suspect that the trade will struggle in this zone I may only set my tp at 10. I sometimes use fib levels and pivot points to confirm the chances of 45/55 breakthroughs. I see you want to only use two indis, but I personally think it's either none at all and price action only or 4 or 5 indis all confirming each other. Later today i'll post a picy and you will see my charts(hopefully). I don't find them too busy. Off to play with the kids now. Snow 6inches deep and schools shut. we don't get this much in sw england, so off sledging. Andy

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Thanks for the response, Andy, quite snowy here too. I have made my "indicator decision" : main indicator is StepRSI only, which has quite some subtleties, as it includes RSI, Fast &amp; Slow Steps and trend lines can be drawn on it, plus horizontal levels of course... I am also using Fib retracement based on the high and low of the previous day, but I am less keen on pivots, preferring to draw obvious trend lines and support / resistance on the charts manually. Still have the 34 ema, so that'll be enough spaghetti for me... and I have reset my profit targets at 40:40:20 %. I also have separate, naked 1 min line charts of both pairs I trade (from shakesfx journal). Have a great sledge with the kids !

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi there. Chicago rob. thanks for the advice. I will now attempt to try and upload a chart from this morning. If it works ok then i'll post the info about it afterwards. Kareem, sorry to try this out here but am keen to show some pics.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Nice posts. Very interesting ideas. Your chart looks good. I assume the Red lines are either entry or re-entry, correct?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Well thanks Rob. that worked fine. The chart I posted may help explain 45/55 more. The 1st vertical red line shows down through lwma and tests the 55 line and the 21 ema(main chart). The others are 10ema-aqua,21ema -blue and 50ema-yellow. The 2nd red line shows where the 55 line is broken.Down slope on lwma. Also cci sets up nicely to enter short. See how the rsi is kept down by first the 55 level, then the lwma until line 3. Now here is no entry as the rsi is close to the 45 line but trapped between. Sideways price action under the 10ema. Line 4 is a possible entry for a long but price action from earlier this morning shows heavy res coming up. Also gbp int rate.I didn't trade these as I was sledging . I did trade 8.04 to 8.18 short for 23 pips and 11.25 to 12.11 long for 27 pips, gmt times. Jtrade, could you upload the igorad step rsi please, I would like to try that. Thanks Andy

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi Kareem. I have explained some more just now. I will post another chart with my earlier entries that I took in a short while. I trade mainly 15 and 5 mins but some days it alll comes together on 1 minute. I find these settings that I use work on all time frames. I use the woodies cci as you can see on the charts. That is second to the rsi but i can remove it for any posts if you wish to keep the thread on rsi only. Andy

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Andy, Please keep everything. I have used the CCI and would like to see how you use it. I think use the RSI the same way as you, but I look at the length of the RSI trend, the longer the better the break( or bounce) set up is. It all makes since with your 45/55 set up. We are both looking at the same thing, but in a different way. I only use the 5M chart. Your posts are very interesting,Thanks.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Here the RSI long term trend is still holding, but there are scalp trades. If you trade those( I don't) smaller stopps and targets.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Nice one, still going.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Its still going. Again the longer the trendline the better the trade is.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Kareem. just took this on the break of the trend line that you too had on yours. M5 chart and look at the lwma supporting the rsi into the break up . In at 1.2798 out 1.2855. I trailed the stop up by 15 pips ish. I took my pips for the day earlier so this trade breaks all the rules apart from not losing.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I would be happy to discuss how I use the cci in conjunction with the rsi. It is a bit detailed and might be easier if we spoke on skype or similar. I would like to know how you used it. Perhaps we could list some main points on here for the others. I am really glad you started this thread as I have always believed that the rsi suits me best and just needed to believe in myself. Also as jtrade has said that his template is complete and rsi choice made, it's important to stick to one set of indis etc for a good period of time before jumping to another. I see you have the qqe on yours and I tried that with all time periods and qqe periods and it works well but I personally prefer the naked rsi. If nothing else you can then trade it on any platform. I use metatrader on a htc mobile with their basic indis and using rsi like this helps me trade from the phone if I need to . The double cci that I use is from the fxprime thread that now has one or two follow up threads. I had cobbled one together before but this is much tidier. andy

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Good point Andy. I see where the LWMA give an ealier(better) signal, and it kept you in the trade. I am still having a problem getting the LWMA on my RSI chart in Ninja. Nice chart/nice trade.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
kareem40 : go here http://www.ninjatrader-support2.com/...ad.php?t=13972 post #4. NB. This is the MA only, so you have to insert onto your chart and then put it into the same sub-pane as the RSI.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thanks Kareem. I had that trend line on , but hadn't considered that there was a longer term trend going on with smaller trend lines within it. I will bear that in mind in future. I do however trade with 4 monitors(4 wide 1 high) and have m15,m5,m1 on eur/usd on 3 and the ig platform on the 4th. This allows me to see how the trend lines and lwma are behaving on higher and lower tf's if I use m5 to trade from. So I suppose that the longer term trend is always showing itself on the m15 for my consideration in a m5 trade. What do you think of the doublewoodies cci. It has a 30sma in limegreen as an entry signal. F4 uses it in his journal ,but I am not sure who adapted it with the sma. Credit must go to him/her though as it can make some entries really clear. As far as your ninja charts why noy try a mt4 demo. Andy

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I would like to chat some time, either thru skype or a chat room. I also used the FXprime CCI set up in the past. I do add one new indicator every week or so, just so I can improve my set up. But like you I am starting to think that all I need is the RSI .

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks Jtrade. I will install today. Kareem

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I have read many posts for F4 he is a good trader. After this week, I will exchange the QQE with the Double CCI and post. We will see. It might be better! Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #153 ---
By the way, I have invited Mr. Seyedinajad to our forum. He is the trader who first wrote about this set up. I hope to hear from him soon. Kareem

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Got it, and its working well thanks.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
btw, I've found some of the Ninja coding to be differently implemented to Tradestation and MT4, so I usually compare charts side by side when first "migrating" a study, then adjust if necessary.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Jtrade have you tried the RSI bands. I have been watching them for a couple of weeks on the 5m eur and they seem to work very well. They are good for a counter trend for a quick 20 or so pips. Look at my previous charts, you will see them there. Kareem

--- 帖子 #157 ---
BTW, I like your screen set up. Which video card do you use/recommend.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi all, Just wanted to pop in and say hello. I've read the whole thread and really like what I see. I've been looking for a way to really simplify my trading... as charts can get very busy with "indis" all over the place. I will set up some charts with all your suggestions (really great btw )... and test on demo 'till I get comfortable with the signals. Been a crazy day so far.. big moves on the yen crosses. Cheers, Jeff

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Welcome Jeff, I remember you from the chat room. I am looking forward to your posts. Kareem

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Which chat room are you referring to?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi kareem. I don't use a single pc with 4 screens and a graphics card like most. I'm not fussed about computers and that seemed very expensive as well. 2 years ago when I bought this lot the flat screens were a fortune compared to now. So I opted for two budget desktops and 4 screens/ 1 computer for two screens. Then had the supplier install a PNY GeForce 7300gs256mb graphics card. That enabled me to connect a second monitor with an adaptor on the cable. The computers are just value dual core 2.8ghz with 1 gb running on xp. My reasoning was that the computers cost £279 each and if one broke I could simply go out and buy one to replace it, but could carry on working with the other one until it suited me to go shopping. I know people who are stuffed when their one system goes down. I back up everything I need to save between them and also to a laptop so a breakdown is no real problem to me. If I invested £1000 or more at the time on 1 pc with 4 monitor card I would feel compelled to repair it should it break and be out of the game for a while. Andy

--- 帖子 #162 ---
The cards were only £40.00 each back then and flat screens now are nothing.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
This one, http://my4x.org/ It might have been FXaddict. I have not been there in a while, so I might have the wrong nick name.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
good set up. For now I have one computer and one labtop. I will add a card and a monitor soon. Thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
How much is that in USD...... Just kidding. Thanks

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Not familiar with that chat room. Probably just a mix up... similar nicknames I guess. No worries anyways. I'm glad to be here, and looking forward to becoming a master of the RSI Trend method. Cheers, Jeff

--- 帖子 #167 ---
How much is that in usd? You might be better off buying one in euros right now andy

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Of course I missed this trade. I just saw it now.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Kareem, Yeah... I missed that one too. Busy fiddling with charts/templates. Didn't want to chase it, as market is pretty whippy right now due to NFP tomorrow. It did run quite a bit... could've shorted it after rejection at RSI trendline. J. http://www.forexfactory.com/C:%5CPro...usd_2_5_09.gif

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I did a quick VDO on RSI... It might even be possible that one will learn something... http://www.chartwatchers.com/group/f...ics/forex-vdos

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Okay, here is why the manual trend line seems to work better. The RSI broke the MA which for me I meant I had to bail out of the trade. On Trendline ( in which I will draw after the first hook) I would have stayed in the trade longer. A difference of 80 more pips, and still counting.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thanks bunton

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Our charts are little differenc since I use the 21 RSI. Note how the RSI reacts to the trendline with the 21 instead 14, again it would have kept you in longer. But the RSI 14 showed the divergence better than the 21. Thanks for the post/chart

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi kareem. look at the divergence with rsi 14 (purple lines). Much more obvious than with 21 imo.I hear what you say about the trend line versus 21 lwma break but the red arrow on the 14 shows why you would stay in. A break of the 55 downwards after a small retest and it was the 21lwma that slapped it back down. Once it goes down it stays below 55. No reason to get out yet, although it wants watching now. If the purple line on the rsi was extended then it would still be holding down the rsi. We both have our own way of doing it and I will use trendlines more. I mentioned the lwma at the start because some were having trouble drawing lines at the right place. This gave them an idea where to place them. Also ,see the dark purple trend line at the top-1200ema. Put that on and see how the 5min eurusd comes off it regular. Andy.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi Andy I understand how you use the LWMA better now. Thanks. Of course I will keep the LWMA on the chart. I like looking at the angle of the LWMA to help detemine the trail stops. It can also give lots of scalp trades. Kareem

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Just broke. Can either go long or exit if you are short. At this time of day, I am always flat.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
flat lwma now and break up of lwma and trendline. I had some on the way down but not all the way. I have had a great day and didn't want to get greedy. got to get some sleep now. andy

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Andy - missed your request earlier - StepRSI attached. K40 - I will check out the RSI bands : they don't immediately "grab" me, but I don't clearly see how they are used at first glance. I used to always have fib bands on my charts. I am using a single high-spec trading computer with 2 x 24" monitors; one monitor is Tradestation only (multiple workspaces : much better to work with than NT or MT4 imho). The other has 2 trading charts for Ninja Chart Trader, which allows me to see the exact IB data on the chart (which is never more than a pip out from TS anyway, but up to 3 pips off MT4, which I only run to check out stuff that I do not have coded in EL or Ninjascript). I only trade futures in TS, as their dome is unusable for forex, becasue of the fractional pips - they really should have sorted this out long ago... Coming back to the Ninja charts, I have been experimenting with their layout as well, from naked 1 min line charts, which I have just deleted as I found that I prefer to watch price in the bid ask panel. But just now I have put up a template originating rfom MTPredictor, for which I have the add-ons (not poss to share, I regret) : this has one feature I really like, which is their Decision Point fib-based targets. I'll post some charts soon if I continue to use them. Lastly, I see great value in manually drawing RSI trendlines even with some form of MA or step.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I wonder how many of us will have purple 1200 emas on our charts tomorrow ? (just put one up myself, actually... :nerd:blush: .. ok, it's getting late here, going to bed...

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I hope i made sense.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Nice set up. I have traded they YM and ES on TS before and lost lots of money. Maybe I was still new to trading or I just FX suites me better. With FX I like the fact that I can trade smaller, specially when I am trading poorly. I hear very good things about MTPredicator, but their price is expensive(for now). How is it working for you? My Ninja is with AMP ( GAIN/same as TS). Its working well for me. Kareem

--- 帖子 #182 ---
hi have just looked at your method,and have a shot of the chart now hear would u go short seeing has broken the trend line onthe rsi,or would u wait for a break of the triange,or wait to see if there is a false breakout thanks

--- 帖子 #183 ---
hi read the whole post,very good put in the trendline, but didnt take trade ,let emotion come in (damm) would of been good happy pips

--- 帖子 #184 ---
hi another trade missed (dam) 20 pips down then up

--- 帖子 #185 ---
'Speaking of missed trades, I get back from the school run about 0900 CET; my charts etc are already reset and running from 0600 when I get up, and I always check them as soon as I get back before even taking my coat off, making coffee etc just in case a trade is setting up at that time (they often do)... having set up my Ninja chart with a "kareem andy combo" (21RSI with WMA), the trendlne broke as I drew it at 0905..... all I can say is aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhhhh. The green box is an MTP Decision Point projected from the high from which I have drawn a blue arrow; this would have been t2 for me. The candle bar colours are MTP Reversal Bars which I do not like but cannot remove with the NT add-on. You up yet, Andy (must be with kids ) ?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Exactly how I would have placed my trendline on RSI. This is what I mean by momentum. A couple of big bear candles, trail the stop, and get out for a nice gain. Rob

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi jtrade. The kids make sure we're up early when there's snow outside. They were on the computer at 6am to see if their schools were shut. They are, so more sledging today. We have had another 6inches of snow last night. Had to drive the wife to work up a big hill out of our village. In a little ford focus I was one of the only ones to make it. Not sure i'll be able to get out later as it's getting really heavy again. Anyway thanks for that step rsi indi. Yoy like the 1200 then. It works just as well if it's a different colour you know. I've just taken my 20 for the compounding tin from the push up on eurusd. The rsi14 tested the 55 down , didn't hold and back up through. Also my cci stayed positive and the whole thing took place above the daily open line and up to the daily pivot point. The red arrow shows the entry. Exit at +20.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Jtrade. How do you interpret the fast and slow step size lines. Do oyu follow the arrows and do they move/repaint/dissappear? Have you seen the big trend line on the m5 about to get tested. The trend line on the m15 is almost impossible to draw its so steep, but I feel it needs to come back to the lwma soon. andy

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Nice trade, Andy. I'm having a Ninja order management glitch for the first time ever this morning : awaiting tech support (they're usually very fast), so sitting on my hands . Where in the SW are you - all the snow's meltnig here (my family is from Scotland, but I grew up in London) ? I'll have to experiment very carefully with those 1200 ema colours...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I use the cross of the fast over the slow, which I think is what the MT4 alerts give (I don't have Step alerts or arrows in TS), AND/OR the cross of the Fast over the 50 centreline. I have this morning "blacked out" the slow step line to see if that is helpful. I am always trying to simplify, simplify... but often revert to complicate, complicate...

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I live in a small village called charfield near woton under edge about 8 miles north of bristol. All the snow melted by last night but more today and the world has ground to a halt. Where are you? Is it amsterdam? By the way ,that 1200 is linked to a special indi with mood lighting attached. In at 12825 on euro and moved my stop to b/e looking to trail this down if poss. I will cut for profit if it shows signs of stopping. Andy

i like osMA indicator(12,26,9) on 1H and also parameters for daily

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I know what you mean about complicated. Last week I deleted about 30 templates and 50 indis from mt4 demos. When I look back at some of those templates I think I was on drugs when I made them. How much time I wasted trying to make something different. Less is better. The step rsi looks similar to the qqe that Kareem has on some of his charts. Karmo uses it in his strategies and I believe came from auslancos thread. I will look at it myself as it makes the turning points very clear with those dirty great arrows. Andy

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi Bunton , thankyou for the video. I had read about this style and sometimes pull up a blank rsi14 and add 40 and 60 line. Then compress the chart and assess the density of rsi lines to see if we are mainly below/above these levels. Your video did make it clearer about comparing the rsi to price. We all learn that as price climbs in an uptrend it will make higher lows on the price, it was more obvious to me how the rsi made higher lows above these 'bull' levels. Ie. a pull back to test a level or ma on the price may see the rsi breaking a previous swing high. This would usually lead me to think it was going down, but now I will look for the rsi to close below say the 40 level to confirm a possible reversal. that said I think that the above relates only to say 4hr and above. Below that on most tf's I trade I find the 45/55 more reliable amongst the noise. What are your thoughts on tf's for your method please. andy

--- 帖子 #197 ---
... this is what happens when you're sitting around waiting for software support (had to reinstall Ninja in the end, btw) : I re-read all kareem40's early posts and charts, and now I've put the 21 RSI back up with trendlines plus the 21 LWMA I showed earlier today. I think k40 may be right about the 21 filtering false entries very well, whilst the WMA cross gives an early warning (and can be taken if the chart structure fits). There's something very good about continually updating those trendlines, too. Ho-hum...

--- 帖子 #198 ---
hi the chart is setting up have i got it right

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi Desperate. Yes you are right in how your trendlines are drawn, but we seem trapped right now between 1.2814 and 1.2787 being daily pivot and daily open. Any breakout now may be driven by profit taking and positioning prior to non farm payroll. Also look at all the price action to the left this morning around 1.2780 mark. Also my lwma 21 is flat and has been since 12.20 It's all waiting for non farm. cad had bad job news and the dollar gave it a quick kicking. This may give the dollar false strength against the euro until nfp. All I know is that it will be 2pm gmt before I enter a trade. andy

no problem . everyone 's still learning. See how the 21 rsi stayed in that 45/55 channel even with the small breakout of your triangle. Sometimes the price isn't obviously in a channel but the rsi shows it. it's not alone in doing this but that's why we're here chatting about it, isn't it? andy

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Where's Kareem? he should be awake now.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
hi cant get the 21 ma on my rsi,i use the mt4 platform and dont know how to do it

--- 帖子 #204 ---
im nearly ready for bed

--- 帖子 #205 ---
desperate I assume you mean the 21 lwma. go into navigator. select Moving average from the indicator list(not custom indis)drag and drop it onto the rsi. In parameters period 21. ma method =linear weighted, apply to = previous indicators data. that should do it. also change the colour and line to dots so you can see it clearly. andy

--- 帖子 #206 ---
thanks andy very good im a computer wiss now(not) got it now

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I stay away on NFP days. Lost too much money before trying to trade major news. I am glad to see some had some good trades already.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi desperate and welcome to the forum. As for your earlier question, I take the trade as soon as the RSI break the line. Make sure that you do not anticipate the cross...you must see it.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
no worries kareem have learned alot today and night,getting sleepy with all the reading and information overload

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I like to start drawing new lines ( new set ups) 30 minutes after the news. RSI ( or most other indicators) mean nothing now!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
good night all have a great weekend where ever u are many pips

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Kareem hows it going. some nice moves on eurusd this morning. What time is 8gmt (london open)where you are? andy

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Jtrade 1200ema on m5 just took 18 short off the touch of 1200ema. It touched mine to the pip on whc demo. I'll buy my mates a beer tonight and tell them the purple line paid for it They don't get what I do and call me Mr Dell Jones. andy

--- 帖子 #214 ---
kareem40 - do you have this article in a form you could post, please ? Do you always wait for bar close before entering with this method ?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi Andy, I am in Dallas, TX. its 9:30 now. I trade 7am until 12noon.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I do have the article, but posting it might cause a problem. Too many lawyers here. And yes I always wait for bar close.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Good for 20. Did not want to hold it any longer. Bulls are in control today!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Good for 50 so far. I only got 20 and bailed!

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Why I only took 20 pips. The (first) trend line was drawn and broken. Of course now a new trend line is drawn.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Yea i also got in that with the break on RSI but i picked up 45 pips off of it i saw divergance on the larger time frame so i stuck in it a lil longer...

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Nice trade Grant, Welcome and thanks for the post. Here is another one in which I stayed longer. Again divergence work very well of the 5M.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hard day to trade! I glad I made my pips early in the morning.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
'Morning. Sitting on my hands, having just missed a fairly obvious triple break long . I've changed my Ninja charts to look more like TS8. RSI is my hybrid 21 RSI + LWMA + 45 / 50 / 55 lines (as no StepRSI coded for Ninja yet). Price chart has simply 9 period Donchian, 34 EMA, horizontal lines at the 00 and 50 levels + weekly HiLoMid. No fibs, no trendlines (well, maybe a little of that on my TS charts...). 1200ema for TS only...

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Morning Jtrade. Have you got your eye on the m15 chart. Big longer term trendline there that might get broken down soon. I am in ready for it about 10 up at the mo, but only because I had some good points last night. I might be in too soon yet, we'll see. Are you using the 1200ema for a trailing stop? Andy

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi, andy, Yes, I draw trendlines on the 15 and 240min charts, and I always look at the Dailies first thing. I entered EU short very late just now, came within 1 pip of being stopped out, didn't take +15 because I thought it would make +18, stopped at b/e.. what am I on this morning !? Proper entry would have yielded +20 no problem... woudda, coudda, shoudd etc etc... "Special sauce 1200ema" now on the Ninja chart as you can see .

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thought you were going to sit on your hands. I too didn't take +12 convinced it was going lower. lost 10 there, but got 80 more overnight than I had planned by staying up late and moving my stop loss to lock in my target and letting it run down to 1.2818 so don't mind too much. Only small stakes at the mo while I try and take bigger targets. Still putting 20 in my tin first and that could have been halfway there. Are you getting problems with ff loading screens today? Andy

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yes... and yesterday... and quite a lot recently, in fact. Congrats on the +80 .

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Cheers for that. Don't tell anyone but it was actually 206. locked in 126 and went to bed with tp at 2818. I was just about to take 30 coming up to midnight and it just went south. Shame it was only £1 a point. Such a move in the asian session is causing this stagnation now perhaps. Andy

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Nice one, Andy. So, not wanting to miss my second triple break of the morning, I placed a stop limit order at 1.2918'5 (based on a level I had drawn earlier on my 240min chart and to allow almost +20 into the break itself*, in case it rejected) and... boom, price blew straight through my level unfilled....grrrrr . VERY unusual with Interactive Brokers not to get filled. Back to sitting on my hands... * the best trader I know taught me to buy into critical break levels, even if only by 6 or 7 pips (much more if possible), rather than, for example, a 1 pip break of a round number like everyone else, whch gets you into trouble if there's a false breakout &gt; reject.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I'm getting fed up with this site. Just typed a message and then tried to submit it and it's gone.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
the site has been playing up for 10 hours today

--- 帖子 #232 ---
VERY annoying, I agree...

--- 帖子 #233 ---
still in your trade,jtrade,i got in at 1.2938 will it test 1.3000

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Nice trade Andy...way to go. Her is what missed last night. Was asleep.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Kareem - all those horizontal lines are making me dizzy..:nerd:

--- 帖子 #236 ---
My first trade....lets see

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I know man....I thinking dropping some of these lines.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
+12 and still moving...my stop is at BE. It's a no risk trade now.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Out + 15

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi Kareem. thanks for that. It was worth staying up late for, and a nice start to wake up to. I think the quick short you had has brought the rsi down to a longer trend line on my rsi14 that started at 2am mt4 time (gmt+1). Its taking a little bounce up again but the price is running into pivot point and daily open above. That said the rsi is till reading 61 so could go either way I feel. I had 1.2934 and hit my limit at 1.2994. I would have moved my limit but was chatting and didn't realise. Wouldn't here myself right now and would have probably got stopped out, so another lesson learnt - take it when you see it. andy

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Kareem. All those price tags up the side of your chart look like a sailing regatta all ready for the off . We could be breaking that trendline down now. short at 12977 after rejection of the pivot point and a break of the trendline under rsi14. just need the 55 line to break and down. very tight stop on this. the trendline is on the m15 by the way and the 61.8 fib level from the big move down last night hasn't held price up. I'm only trying this as I made 60 this morning so can use some as a stop as I fancy this down. I should really wait for the m15 to close but just see it going. Andy

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hey Andy, I have to fix these tags...too many you are right. 60 is very nice. If I get 60, I am usually done for the day. Thats a very good day. I am getting worried about this market now. Its waiting for news and when it does that it tend to get very choppy, but I have watching these lines with you. And yes FF is acting funny today

--- 帖子 #243 ---
60 and some more last night but only small stakes. just looking for some more now on this one while risking 20 (stop at 12977). I'm back on the tools for 2 days tmw and thur so wanted to make the most of today without throwing the winnings away. See how the lwma is holding the rsi down at the mo. andy

--- 帖子 #244 ---
The newest trend line is holding so far

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I'm out of that for +6. saw +20 at one point but was hopeing for more. that lines broken up now kareem and may try 3000 again. andy

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Choppy...but broke it and make the pips. I did not take this one.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Just sold on a divergence

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Break here, buy, bounce sell

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi Kareem My post after yours where you sold on a divergence has disappeared. Strange, I saw it there unlike some posts that are gone when the server rejects it. How did you get on selling on that divergence? Andy

--- 帖子 #250 ---
FF posts are acting very funny today.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
That divergence was the very top of the day (US). I took profits way too early...still a good day.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Looks good so far

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Short from 1.2951... stop to b/e in a pip or two...

--- 帖子 #254 ---
i got in the same place,looks like a downward move

--- 帖子 #255 ---
... ping ! Stopped at b/e (actually +1 and +2), probably a perfect example of moving the stop to b/e too soon, ie. not giving the trade enough room to breathe... however, there has been a steady 5min uptrend this morning (sideways on 240 &amp; daily), so it was a counter-trend trade requiring max defense. The "easy to see with hindsight" solution was to have noticed that the swing high had RSI divergence, then formed a "double top lower high" and to have sold around 63 with room for a +20 partial profit. One of these days...

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Jtrade, I get many BE stops. Actually my goal on each and every trade is to be at break even. I know it sounds strange, but every day I trade just to protect my capital. I only started winning after I did this. Kareem

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Great post, kareem40.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Two breaks today. The last one worked very well.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I just watching. Got my target for the day. But it does look good!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Since this thread focuses on the RSI I was hoping someone could help me. Is it possible to code the attached indi it so it alerts on the OUTER levels (30/70, 60/40, etc, or any level you set it for), not just the 50 level? I like this indi alot, and I highly recommend it. It picks out the extreme highs &amp; lows really well, which is why I would like the alert to be re-coded for those levels and not the 50. Many thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
It did very well. still going use the RSI to exit.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi and welcome. I hope someone can help, I know nothing about coding. Kareem

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Was reviewing the Daily eur chart. The divergence there was worth 300 pips. New chart courtsey of Jtrade. Thanks Jtrade I like it. Kareem

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hey Kareem40, Are you still alive? I haven't seen you post here for a couple days. Hope all is well. You still using this system? You seem to have done well with this in the past. I use the RSI 21 myself on the 1 &amp; 5min and feel it works fairly well. AZ

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi AZ, Still here, still trading the RSI. The set up has not done well the past three trading days, but the with some money mgt my losses have been small. The Markets have been very choppy the past week or so. Too much news I guess. I still believe in the set up. I will start posting more. Thanks for your post. Kareem

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Just glad your still alive and kicking Good luck &amp; Good trading! AZ

--- 帖子 #267 ---
so have u givin up on your thread?.....

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Here is an example a good divergence set up. The market has been choppy, and it has been harder to get good set ups. These conditions do happen about 4-5 times a year. I have been protecting my capital by not trading as much. But I am still here. Thanks

--- 帖子 #269 ---
hello i just bought a book on the rsi called RSI LOGIC,SIGNALS,&amp;TIME RAME CORRELATION by walter j baeyens from the traders press. from the little i have read i highly recommend

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks I will look for it. Kareem

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I've put your setup on my trading software (rbs marketindex) EUR/USD only 5 minute chart 21 period RSI Enter/exit based on RSI Trend lines but i didn't found the right time with the entries...... Is here anybody who can explain me that rsi-thing a easy way? my english isn't perfect. if heres somebody german, who can write me an PM..... See you.....

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi This set up has only two possible entries, either the trendline break and or when we have divergence.Now we have a trendline when we have at least two connecting points. The longer the line the better the set up. Please review the older posts and you will see some examples. Please let me know if the programming has worked for you. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #273 ---
New work responsiblities has not allowed me to post, or even trade. The set up is still there and it does work good. Just take your time and allow it to come to you.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Kareem, This thread is one of the most practical and useful trading threads extant. I have implemented this strategy into my trading regimen with very good results. Many thanks for sharing, Bob in Wisconsin

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Here is a creative chart to look at.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Here is how it flipped over and went long.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
3 was were I got out anf flipped it. Current flat.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Thank you for the Kind Note Bobcat. I am still travelling and unable to post much. I will get back into more posts next week. Please feel free to post any trades you made. Kareem

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Thank you for the charts Bunton. Very interesting look at the RSI. Please continue your posts. Kareem

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Some nice RSI set ups. I will post some more trades this week. Kareem

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi, If you were trading an intraday stratedgy on a 15M chart, what RSI period would you recommend. A 14 or 21 ? Thanks for your ideas!... T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Nice thread! Has anybody tried with 1 min charts? What are the settings for Step RSI? Thanks Chamane

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I found the 21 to work all on all time frame charts. I looked the 15M and founded it to work well, but you do need bigger stopps ( of course you will get bigger rewards) when you do that. Thanks

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I did but I got too many false signals. I would not trust the divergence signal on the RSI. The same happened in the 3M. As for the RSI I just have the 21 period rsi. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #285 ---
So I suppose it's good for 5 min up TF. I tried StepRSI (8,5,10) and it seems to be following price quite good on 5 min. chamane

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Please post a picture when you can. I am still using the plain RSI and draw lines manually. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #287 ---
i like this method. it is similar to one i used to use a while back by inserting a GANN FAN on the HIGHS &amp; LOWS of the RSI. this thread is good. pity i cannot vote on it. nice work.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thank you for the post. I am still using it. I just added the adx to tell when not to trade at all. Kareem

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi, K, good to see you posting. Here's my current setup : I semi-duplicated andypips' RSI Colored indicator usage within TradeStation and shrunk my Klinger ATR indicator to just a red green line + the Better Volume. I'm not drawring trendlines on the RSI at present, much as I like them : I just want the RSI to be above or below 50. I like divergence trades and also manually draw pivots through congestion areas ; had my 8 yr old not walked into my office at the time, I would have taken the red arrow trade shown : a "divergenceRSI&lt;50throughpivot" entry. As you know I've only just returned from an unexpected trip to Germany, so my first trade for 2 weeks was the one shown earlier. A small trade, but still $175 in the bank... J.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Welcome back J. Thanks for the post. Very interesting set up. Seems to work very well. It seems that the paint bar works very well also. I still using the RSI and drawing lines, but I have it with other indicators as well. I am also setting up for the FX Micro contracts. Once the Volume picks up, will move to the CME micro. I am really getting tired of the broker games. Again good to have you back. Kareem

--- 帖子 #291 ---
1st time posting here , found you after a RSI search this morning , have read all , set up a chart and will try some trades later tonight . I` m on west coast . Curious what your other indi`s are now ? Guess I favor a simple price action approach but always open to learn . Thanks for your thread , really hope it keeps going . BTW wheres andy ? his charts were great . Will post one of mine as soon as I have a trade to show . cheers - glass

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Are you entering on the break or close of the candle after the break?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks for the kind words, K. The paint bar is very simple and yet I find it more useful than the popuar HA bars : all it does is paint the bars above / below the ema (I am using 34ema, thanks Islander). I'm going to try to post a comparison here, made by the guy who coded it (a truly brilliant programmer and trader - a rare combination imho - hope he won't mind me posting his chart).... I am also going to check out a newer version which adds a neutral color. PS. I have modified my chart AGAIN this morning... it's that pesky (ie. excellent) VSA thread in the Discussion section that's given me a new case of "volume indicatoritis" to which I am always vulnerable...

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I have added ( and took out) about 8 indicators to get better trades. So, far I do use the 20 EMA and ADX to work best. And what I mean by that is, they tell me when not to trade any RSI set up. I will post some more pics over the weekend. I am still trading part time and work has been busy. Andy is still around and trading, and yes he does have some great set ups. He is a good trader. Thanks for your post. Kareem

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I like candle close, and always after the break. Thanks for your post.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi J, I am starting to use the 20 ema more and more. It seems to show support and does trade well with the 21 RSI trendline. I assume this Paint bar is a Tradestation indicator, correct? Be careful trading tomorrow! Should be wild. Kareem

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Latest chart here - getting simpler and I might even try running without the RSI , ie. Klinger + ATR indicator only, then focus on PA &amp; volume. But I should go to bed and have a good night's sleep before removing my trusty RSI ... I downloaded the new TradeStation (yes, these charts are TS) 8.5 today : lots of new charts to experiment with : range bars, momentum bars, Kase, Kagi, Renko.... but my guess is that I will stick with tick and volume bars for the time being. It might have been Kierkegaard who said "Too much choice leads to the madhouse"...

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Yes J, its like a 10-year-old in a toy store. I love TS's charting. They are the best. The Klinger is RSI based, correct?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
No, see below a piece by Klinger himself, but this was in turn modified some years ago by an excellent contributor to the TradeStation forum (only accessible to TS users) called Trend39. I use Trend39's version. Published by Stephen Klinger: (TS does have a Volume Oscillator in its library.) The Dec 1997 issue of Tech Analysis of Stocks and Commodities published the Klinger Oscillator in the December Traders’ Tips. This is the cut and paste explanation: In "Identifying trends with volume analysis" in this issue, Stephen Klinger gives a new approach for using volume. The TradeStation Traders' Tip this month is based on the volume oscillator (KVO) presented in the article. For TradeStation and SuperCharts, we'll call the indicator Volume Osc (not the one that we have in the TS library). This indicator can plot both the short-term and long-term versions of the oscillator. The indicator uses a total of four inputs: FastX determines the length of the faster (shorter) exponential moving average of the volume force; SlowX determines the length of the slower (longer) exponential moving average of the volume force; Trigger determines the length of the exponential moving average used to smooth the KVO line; and Smooth determines the amount of smoothing of the KVO and trigger lines using a summation of the values. The Smooth input allows for the generation of smoothed plot lines for longer-term analysis. If the Smooth input is set to 1 or zero, no smoothing will be in effect. The process of developing this indicator begins with the creation of two functions, Vforce and KVO. These two functions basically provide supporting calculations, which will allow the oscillator values to be easily referenced from other custom studies. The two functions should be created in the order presented below, using their assigned names. The Klinger Oscillator is a construct which is intended to illustrate when price changes are confirmed by volume. The price is expected to follow the Klinger Oscillator if there is a divergence between the price and the indicator. The Klinger Oscillator computation involves constructing a parameter called the 'Volume Force' which combines close, high, low, and volume into a single indicator. The Klinger Oscillator is then created as a fast exponential moving average of the Volume Force minus a slow exponential moving average of the Volume Force. The KO takes two input parameters: the periods for the fast and slow moving averages, respectively. See a picture of Bearish Divergence at this site: http://www.stockworm.com/help/manual/klinger-oscillator.html This is an explanation from Prohet.net: http://www.prophet.net/learn/taglossary.jsp?index=K They show the Klinger Oscillator and they have also changed it to a Klinger Histogram which essentially levels the reference line of the Klinger Volume Oscillator to zero. The KO is derived from three types of data: the high-low price range, volume, and accumulation/distribution. Price range is a measure of movement and the force behind that movement is volume. Accumulation is when the sum of today's [high]+[low]+[close] is greater than yesterday's. Distribution is when today's sum is less than the yesterday's. When the sums are equal, the existing trend is maintained. Volume produces continuous intraday changes in price as it reflects buying and selling pressure. The KO quantifies this difference between the number of shares being accumulated and distributed each day as "volume force." A rising volume force should accompany an uptrend. It should then gradually contract over time during the latter stages of the uptrend and the early stages of the following downtrend. This should be followed by a rising volume force reflecting some accumulation before a bottom develops. By converting the volume force into an oscillator representing the difference between a 34-period and 55-period exponential moving average with a 13-period trigger, the force of volume into and out of a security can be tracked. Comparing this force to price action can help identify divergences at tops and bottoms. The KO works well for timing trades in the direction of the trend but can be less effective when going against a trend. However, when the KO diverges from the underlying price action, the observed trend may be losing momentum and nearing its completion. Klinger notes the most important signal occurs when the KO diverges with the underlying price action, especially on new highs or new lows in overbought/oversold territory. A stock achieving a new high or low for a cycle with the KO failing to confirm this shows a trend that may be losing momentum and is nearing completion. If the price is in an uptrend (above an 89-day exponential moving average), buy when the KO drops to unusually low levels below zero, turns up, and crosses its trigger line. If the price is in a downtrend (i.e., below an 89-day exponential moving average), sell when the KO rises to unusually high levels above zero, turns down, and crosses its trigger line.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Thanks J.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Another divergence that worked well.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Of course sometimes it does not work. Keep your stops to 20.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi, K, Hope all is well across the ocean. RSI is a definite keeper : as much as I like the Klinger Volume (also a keeper) - it shows divergence VERY well, rather like the asymmetric RSI we looked at - the standard RSI remains a loyal servant. It will sometimes support a trade where the Volume is not easy to interpret, or keep me out of a trade by showing trend strength. Here's my latest EC short - I know you like these divergence entries : they are indeed high probability trades. I've increased to 4 x EC ($500k) in a 1:2:1 formation (sounds like a soccer line up...wtg, Manchester United ). Remember what andypips was saying about how focussing on those 20 pip trades would have worked out better in the long run ? My stats show me that my "middle" exits carry most of my profit. I still like to hold the last contact as an outlier trade, but mostly it makes less than the middle lot. Food for thought as always... Working hard on eliminating those trades that in hindsight were obvious low prob trades... (I make them every day )... but hitting my base target consistently now.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
.. and not having anything better to do, here's my Ninja ChartTrader chart, which as you can see I have cleaned up to "beautiful minimalism". Showing the same trade - I now set this chart to "Always on top" and lay it right onto my TradeStation workspace next to the 89/233 tick signal chart posted above. I've become fanatical about getting my charts set up exactly as I want them :nerd:. Btw, it's only 34 tick as I am charting my broker feed - IB do not transmit all ticks which causes some to dislike using their data for charting. However, the advantage if you already have another charting platform is (a) charting the exact data you are trading and (b) in a fast market, eg. after major news, I have found IB to almost never lag, unlike TS and just about everything else.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi J, Good to see posting again. I am glad you are doing well. Your charts look good, seems that you found your set ups. I am still with Ninja/AMP, but will make the change over to E micros when the volume improves. I will post these charts as I trade them.The RSI have been very helpful lately with exits, specially when I enter with multi lots. Here is an example. I entered the trade based in S/R not RSI, but the RSI helpem max my profits. Take care, Kareem

--- 帖子 #306 ---
What a lovely clean chart wih great exits .

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Here is a nice break from this morning. when looking for the price to go back to the 40MA, the RSI can help know when it is ready to go back home!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks J.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
The 40 MA ended up being a very good exit. The RSI did not with the exit this time.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Now we are showing divergence.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Would you take another 40MA touch after divergence?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Not a good idea!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I have tried many indicators that you can not count. I was thinking "how can i make pips that make me relieved?". The only system for me is just divergence and braking point. Like RSI you can try CCI on the chart. They have same idea actually. I really thank kareem40 and the friends who contributed.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thank you for your kind post. And yes I think the CCI, ROC and the momt indicator can do the same thing. It is all the same concept. I like the RSI, since it was my first kiss(pips), and I just stuck with it. Please feel free to share any idea you might have on the CCI. I know Andy is using mostly the CCI to trigger enteries/exists. Kareem

--- 帖子 #315 ---

Interesting...I have never tried lines on a stochs. They function in a different way than the RSI/ROC, be careful trusting the line break on stochs. Thanks again for the post. Kareem

Well changing color gives me an idea of what to do..An example from color RSI..What i do is just divergence

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Sometimes divergence is like a "holy grail". You should find the best point to do

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Please note on strong trending days, divergence do not work. Keep a tight stop even with divergence, in case the trend continue. My stops are always at 20 pips. Thanks for the post. Kareem

Hi, Kareem , Hope all's well in sunny FL. Here's my current Ninja chart for you to consider - very simple, the result of a LOT of thought and trading... note the RSI settings :nerd:. NB. I also need the trades to simultaneously trigger on a 233 tick TradeStation chart, which has Klinger volume (trying to get this coded for Ninja). J.

using ADX when strong trending days. you can avoid the wrong trade

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi J, How do you like MTP. Seems to work well in their presentation. How is your trading. Not much here, still travelling and watching. Glad to hear that you still have the RSI on. It seems to work well. I will try to post again next week, but it has been busy. Take care

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi, k, Here's my current Tradestation chart - regular RSI now replaced with QQE (which is based on RSI) : good for trade hold. My Ninja chart still with RSI as per a few posts up. Hope you're doing well - I am SO BORED ("I'm Chairman of the Board..."), I've even drawn a fib retracement . Daily target in the bag, 1 contract still running (Mrs jtrade says I should stop trading for the day once my $500 is banked, but really, I should be averaging $1k by now...). I think I will take Lady for a play in the garden (new Goldendoodle puppy - the new love of my life - pic duly attached).. J. Edit : I forgot to add that my new goal is to make only 1 daytrade a day, timed around - and usually ahead of and into - the various London ORB trades. I am adding longer term methods - starting lots of backktesting with a new Tradestation add-on widget that tests multiple instruments in multiple timeframes via the new TS GO.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi J Nice trade to start the day with. The qqe is nice , do you use the 5 period or is that 34 on the top left i see. Hope all is well and i see you posting on the eur/gbp t/magic hysteria thread. I have been following it but i think it may start to get out of hand. Paulus has pulled back from moderating it today. I'm still using t/lines on an rsi and using the double cci with sma. thats it along the bottom of my charts these days. Kareem is still busy with work i understand. Are you only trading the eu futures and dax? Andy

--- 帖子 #327 ---
...or in my case a nice trade to finish the day with . Here are the TS QQE inputs I'm using : I couldn't get the QQE set up the way I like it in MT4, although I do have it fine in Ninja. Good to hear from you, btw, andy - I was wondering how you've been. K : sorry, didn't answer your question about MTP. I use the MTP Decision Points for targets and support / resistance (in Ninja), althugh I know many traders who use MTP successfully as their base trading method. HOWEVER, I am about to ditch almost everything I've learned about targets etc and - as we discussed with andy awhile back - just target 20 pips "whatever the weather". The trade I posted above just closed with the three contracts at +8, +20, +14, so 42 pips x $12.50 = about $510 after commissions, but if I just took off +20 x 3, then it would have been $735 (it's about $5 / contract rt commission). A bit more stress not grabbing my 8 tick "fix", but much less after that. Making big 100 pip+ trades is great, but I want to pay the bills. 100 pips / week x 5 lots is $20k / month. I think that's a realistic target, but in this area " my perception is not yet my reality ". Time for a cappuccino.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I have TrendMagic and The London Progressive templates up in MT4 : I am interested in my setups that trade into their entries. I don't blame Paulus for pulling back a bit (he shares so many interesting ideas) : I think there is a direct correlation between the amount of posts I make and my trading well, ie. the less posting the better, really... I want to experiment with iGoR's SuperMM (over on Forex TSD under his Zorro thread), so not trading the DAX at the moment and about to trade cash fx as I need to reduce lot size as it gets fairly hysterical : it can go from 1 mini to several full size quite fast. Can't say too much as (a) I don't fully understand it and (b) there is a commercial element and we're not supposed to mention such things over here (no commerical element for me personally, I hasten to add) ! If anything comes of it, I will definitely let you know.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi J. Thanks for the answers. What do you call an intelligent blonde? .....A Golden Retreiver. Glad to see you making the pips. I am still pushing forward with the 20 pips thing but keep trying to increase lot size too quickly. Get bored and overtrade. I am learning quickly though. As part of the process I report to the wife each evening and the swift quicking I get on a losing day readjusts those targets and percentages very quickly. I have some days when I clear 100 but others when i'm fighting all day to break even. It's not worth the grey hairs. I do find that my first two trades each day are the best. It doesn't seem to matter what time of day. I know this means I should walk away and come back 4 hours later but I still think this makes me lazy. I will overcome this i'm sure. Don't tinker too much though with your system , it seems you have it nailed. I find that as it starts to become boring I look for something new and exciting. The reality is that boring usually means profitable and safe. I don't do boring and safe but know I have to. Speak soon Andy

put Wailliams' Percent R over RSI all default setting, you can avoid the bad trade. (it short of form MACD)

The RSI really works, I use the RSI 70/30 Strategy. I took my Live account from $900 to $16,000 . . . in one week , I was 49 out of 53 trades using the RSI 70/30 , and I was only trading GBP/USD, EUR/USD, and the AUD/USD. I would trade all three currencys at the same time most of the time on the 15min chart, my target or max pip profit is usaully about 20 to 30 pips, unless i just move my stoploss up then my earnings have the potential to be alot more. It is really simple too use!!!

Hello It is nice to see the thread alive again. I glad to hear that you guys are still here and still trading well. I am back to trading again. Since I little rusty, I am trading small. It also seems as markets are very choppy for the last couple of weeks. I am still using the RSI, but I made some changes ( and added some new ones) to my trading set ups. We really should all have different set ups/indicators for different types of markets. I truly believe now that there is no one set up/indicator that can make us pips ( or keep us profitable) every day. I strong trending days, the RSI can kill your account. I am using additional set ups and I will post some charts next week. So far I am doing well. I have not lost any money in the past two weeks. I am also very strict with my risk management. I will not risk more than 2% on any trade, period. I am also watching the euro futures (but trading spot); I like it better than spot since I can see the volume as well. I like to trade spot since I can drop down to 25k lot. This can be useful when I am having bad weeks. With futures you are stuck with the same size no matter what. I tried the Micro mini, but the spread/fill in those instruments are crazy. Sometimes I think someone is actually watching trade those things are laughing out loud. Jtrade I like your charts and dog. I do use Fibs a lot to see if we have a retracement or trend change. I agree sometimes less is more in trading, but I still have a problem of taking my profits too fast, so it forces me to trade more. $500 per day is good, J . Like your wife I say take it and go swimming or golfing. Andy I did watch your set up and it seems to work well. Post some charts if you made any changes. Like you Andy I tend to start the trading day with a couple of good ones ( trades!) then do give it back to a better trader. I will continue to stay in touch in this thread. Kareem

I too have used RSI to exit. This is an interesting twist.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi Kareem and friends, Great thread, thank you. I am a bit of an imposter here as I only trade stocks. I trade my super fund which places restrictions on what I can trade. However, the RSI is the basis of my trading and has been for a long time. I am 70+ years old and trade on the daily charts (using multiple timeframes). I allocate half an hour max. to trading each day, sometimes just 5 mins to update my stops. RSI Construction If you plug values into the RSI formula, you will find that it is more responsive around the 50 level, as the RSI values move towards 0 and 100 - it becomes less responsive i.e. it takes a larger price move to change the RSI by a set amount. RSI Features It is a leading indicator, does not lag price It can be used successfully as a stand alone indicator in any market condition It offers reliable support/resistance levels It can be used for line studies (including trendlines) It can be used to highlight abnormal conditions (extremes) It can be used to show regular and hidden divergence Special feature It offers low risk type tradesi.e. the distance between the initial stop and entry point is small, therefore it provides the possibility of acheiving a good risk/reward I believe that working on keeping my losses to a minimum was my ah ha moment in trading RSI Support/Resistance levels (they are more zones as opposed to actual levels) The RSI offers very good S/R levels at 20, 40, 60, and 80 -Price is in an uptrend when it is bouncing between/of the 40/80 levels, when it goes above 80, this is an extreme, see below -Price is in a downtrend when it is bouncing between/of 20/60 levels, when it goes below 20 , this is an extreme - see below - Price is not trending (range bound) when it is bouncing between/of the 40/60 levels Trading signals: Can use standard S/R tactics or trend trade - Take long trade when RSI passes up thro say the 60/65 zone (new trend following congestion) - Take long trade when RSI passes up thro say 35/40 zone (new trend following a large correction, or down trend) - Take short trade when RSI passes down thro 40/35 zone (new trend following congestion) - Take short trade when RSI passes down thro 65/60 zone My Favourite signals: 1 RSI extremes - If the RSI goes above 80, then it must be a strong move (see construction) - This is an abnormal condition and is not sustainable, it ultimately must fall! - If I use it as an entry signal - then I enter as it falls below 80 - If I am already in the trade when it goes above 80, I place a stop below the associated price bar, and keep doing this with each subsequent bar until I am stopped out (no point in giving back a windfall profit) 2 RSI / Price divergence The RSI gives good divergence signals both regular and hidden Regular divergence - sign of weakness, expect a reversal of sorts Hidden divergence - sign of strength , expect trend continuation - Long signal: Price lower low/ RSI higher low (regular divergence) - Long signal: Price higher low/ RSI lower low (hidden divergence) - Short signal: Price higher high/RSI lower high (regular divergence) - Short signal: Price lower high/ RSI higher high (hidden divergence) If we are in a trade and a regular divergence occurs - we should at a minimum tighten our stop Divergence may occur over more than two swing highs/lows, so price action should be used to confirm a trade These are high probability trades 3. RSI line studies including trendline and other standard patterns Exits Other than the extremes mentioned above - You may consider using..... as the RSI approaches an RSI S/R level , tighten your stops to just below the associated price bar (for long trades - opposite for shorts) or trendline breach Thats about all that I can think about, at the present moment, in the ramblings above I hope there is something somewhere worth considering Please do not ask me to post any charts - too hard and time is precious - too many more important things to do (can't teach an old dog new tricks) Before committing real money with any of the above , please check to make sure that it works for you. Kareen, I hope I have not mis used your thread. I very rarely post - too time consuming Thats my contribution for another year Don't worry - be happy Be profitable Peter ps I use RSI (9)

Hi Peter, Thank you for a great post. Much to read and study in what you have posted. I have read some of what you posted in different articles, but not in this much detail, and not at the same place. I will try and watch for your set ups and I hope we can have you post some more in future. You seem to know the RSI very well. I am glad you found us and I hope to hear from you again soon. From what I found it seems (to me) that the RSI does not work well on anything less than 15M time frame. What do you think? Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi Kareem, To get a better understanding of using the RSI draw the R/S 80/40 levels in green and the 60/20 levels in red Another point - regarding divergence As the RSI is a bound indicator i.e. operates between 0 and 100 and is less responsive at its extremes - sometimes it may miss a divergence Consider using an unbound oscillator, say the CCI(10). I have both of them on my screens. Regarding the RSI ON 15MIN CHARTS - I would imagine the "noise" at that level would make any indicator questionable, probably best to use price S/R and price action Personally anything under the 4 hour chart is not in my cumfort zone - even when I was more active in the market in my younger years. Another problem with indicators especially when the period used for the calc is small is exceptionally large price moves - the indicator value when this occurs is acceptable - but when this price drops out of the calc, it can give a questionable reading Well thats me for the day,its nearing bed time here is Aussie land 11.17pm Have a great day Peter

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi Kareem, Just a quicky. I feel I may have changed the direction of this thread a little, which was not my intention. I THINK THE USE OF THE RSI TRENDLINE IS A GREAT WAY TO TRADE. Like any signal not all trendlines are created equal? some have better potential than others so if this is the case - it would be in our interest to wait for only the best. How do you grade your trendlines? Does the location within the RSI range have any significance/expectation/potential (with reference to my initial post) Do you reference higher and lower timeframes Are some trendlines stronger than others, depending on how the RSI trace interacts with the trendline Is the steepness of the trendline meaningful Do trendlines tend to be more prevalent / work better on some pairs than others Do you use price action for confirmation of a breach of the trendline etc. etc I hope the above gives you something to think about / experiment with Sorry for the intrusion, I'm going back into hibernation Have a great day Peter

Hi Peter, I have been trading for years. The first three were losing years, but they were, luckily, small losses. I did not make a lot of money then, so I kept losses small trading mini lots only. Eight months ago I read somewhere that large number of professional traders were asked this question; if you had to choose only one indicator on your charts, what would that indicator be? Most answered RSI. So I did some reading and found out that the RSI divergence is one of the most powerful signal a trader can get. So I traded (only) the RSI divergence on the EURUSD and made an average of 20 pips a day for almost six months. Then I found an interesting TASC article (mentioned in the 1st post) about trend lines and started to use it. I did very well for about a month. I used it only on the EURUSD 5M chart and made somewhere between 20-40 pips a day. Then one day it just stopped working. Or may be I did! Luckily at that time my full time job was getting busier and busier so, I have stopped trading it for a while. Now that work ( sales out of the house) is back to normal, I am watching the RSI trend line set up and I see it working again ( or again it was most probably me). What seems, now and in the past, to work best is the divergence in combination of the trend lines for exit. I am trading again using RSI and a couple of other set ups I have picked up along the way. I have noticed that the higher the angle of the trend line is, the better the break. Also the longer the trend line, the better the trade will be. I have also used multiple trend lines for scale out set up. I have also noticed that the RSI set up (or any other set up for that matter) will not work during major news. The RSI trend line seems to lead price, many examples are posted earlier. And most important is I only tried this on EURUSD and 5M chart for a short period of time; six months. I will start posting again soon. I am also thinking of changing/adding to the NQ futures contract, but not with the RSI trend line set up. Please feel free to add any ideas you have. I like the RSI and would like to work with it some more. I liked your post and you seem to have good grasp over your trading. I will use your ideas and post some (hopefully) successful trades using your concepts. I will do my best to actively post more. Do try to learn posting pictures. Once learned you will find out that they are even faster than typing. Hi Andy, Glad to see you posting again. I hope all is well. Kareem

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi K. Good to hear you have found time to trade from home again. Will be busy with other things tmw but will chat soon. Lizpet has stirred the grey matter again. Also tried binaries today and had some luck. Andy

Hi Andy/Kareem, Andy, RSI formla: RSI=100-[100/1+(U/D)] where U=the average upward price change and D= the average downward price change VARIABLE ;U/D RATIO Draw up table as below and insert U, D values e.g UP move Down move RSI 1 1 50 2 1 66.6 difference 16.6 . . . 9 1 90 10 1 90.91 difference 0.91 . . . etc Do another table for a variance in down moves - same type result Don't know the mathamatical term for this progressively increasing/decreasing up/down ratio to RSI value - logerithmic exponential ?? PS The only indicators that I use are RSI- Basic trading, and indispensible in scanning for trades based on the RSI S/R levels Bollinger Bands - used for breakouts/trend trading (also great S/R) ADX - great for confirming the start of a new trend ADX/SAR - combination great to pin point the end of a short term trend I could trade pure price action and R/S but I am addicted to the above indicators - a no thought process as I know them pretty well PS Bollinger Bands can also be used as a stand alone indicator when used with breakout trades fron consolidation My trading (stocks) also incorporate VSA, PA, price S/R and especially multi timeframe analysis (for market structure) Have to go - plumber has just arrived to do a little? job for us. Will post again later Regards Peter (hope the above makes sense - not checked)

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Back again - that was short and "sweet" $100+ (min charge) to be told that the unit has to be replaced (5 mins) Oh well back to trading: If you are interested in the RSI S/R levels - check out what happens when say the RSI trades thro the 60/65 area (from congestion), and when it drops back thro this area - same when it drops back below 80 - this is basic S/T trading If you want to give your trade more room i.e. stay in the trade as long as it does not move into a downtrend, then as long as the RSI stays above 40 stay in the trade (this will obviously include sideways movement which hopefully leads to trend continuation - refer to higher timeframe for likelyhood A stock trading status is confirmed when the RSI tests both its support and resistance levelse.g. a stock is range trading when confirmed by the RSI testing both 40 and 60 An uptrend following a large correction will pass up thro the 40 area and pass right up thro the 40/60 (range trading area) and then thro the 60/65 area -------- Depending on your trading style - you could also trade of any of these levels (I also include 50 as an important level) e.g. say RSI approaches 80 - place stop below the associated price bar etc, etc Simple RSI trading Check it out - experiment - so many options The RSI is tops - some say it can also be used to predict price, but I never ventured into that area. Like every other method PA,PA S/R, VSA, Elliot Wave, you name it, any form of TA or FA, THE RSI is definately not infallable, just use whatever you feel comfortable using. Have a trading plan, and each trade that you take trade it the same way each and every time as per your plan. Only take the best trades, be patient and KEEP YOUR LOSSES TO A MINIMUM (only take low risk trades) and get your stop to break even ASAP Hope my little input will be of use to somebody Trade well This is too time consuming - definately my last post RSI - Really Superior Indicator Have a great day Peter

Got to post a quickie (even though I decided to stop posting till after the summer... that didn't last long) : finally after all these years I managed to exit on the low.

Hi Lizpet. thanks for the answer on the rsi formula although I have to admit it's a bit over my head. i'll stick to what I know. I am trying the rsi9 alonside the 14. have you tried using a ma for entry. I currently use a 20ema on rsi 14 and the rsi9 for entry on a 1 minute chart. Hi K. How do I post charts on here. Can you remind me again please and i'll post some of my trades as I take them. Hi J. Good money for the day. Are you still splitting your trade in three or just going for the 20 pips in one go as you mentioned before? Don't stop posting, just post here in one place. I have changed my targets slightly. 20 point target for compo tin then keep scalping for 10 's until i get two losses in a row then stop. Doing well and only needed to stop when got bored so far. About 60 pips per day. Andy

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi Andy, In MetaTrader just right click and save as picture in your desktop. Then in " manager attachments" import that picture to your post. It is very easy. Also I will take 20 pips a day, lately I am just breaking even. Markets seem very choppy the past two weeks. Kareem

--- 帖子 #353 ---
60 pips is not too shabby : well done ! I found my quick fix for 10 pips on part of the position suits my psychology : I can then move the stop to the size of the partial profit for a b/e trade, still giving it some room. But I am finding it very difficult to finalise this issue. I'm trading in two lots rather than my preferred thirds as I am experimenting with d'Alembert position sizing. 2 lots / contracts&gt;4&gt;6&gt;8 increasing after a loser , coming back down after a winner. I am of course assuming I can maintain a very high win rate.... probably another example of my stupidity... ...but most of my present focus is on longer term trading based primarily on RSI... lots of R&amp;D going on.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi J, Futures mag. had an article recetly that document the all-in/all-out as the most profitable way to trade, but they did mention that scalping the first lot and moving to BE on the rest was the most "comfortable" way to most traders. So, you are doing the right thing even though it is not the most profitable. Kareem

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi, Nice to see the thread picking up steam again. Nice chart jt. Looks a good combination of indicators CCE used for entry provided Klinger is negative, and Klinger for EXIT ? Andy, Regarding "do I use a ma"? No Does not suit my style of trading - will give late signals, and when your pair is range trading it will tend to give false signals My trading is based primarily on RSI support and resistance levels, with divergence trading also a favourite Have you considered the use of multi timeframes? I use three, I look for a signal on the intermediate timeframe. Confirm that it is in the same direction as the highest timerame Then look for an entry in the same direction on the lowest timeframe When all three timeframes are in alignment your probability of a winning trade, and a good sized move, is high. Your trading with the backing of the traders using the higher timeframes Keep on posting your charts, I can see what you are doing, but wish I could directly compare them to my charts. As mentioned earlier, I cannot trade Forex, I'm stuck with stocks Have a nice weekend Peter

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi, Peter, I just made a lengthy reply explaining my trading method and then right clicked by mistake and deleted my post...grrrrrrrrr... so sorry, too tired to continue on a Sunday night (just shared a bottle of 1988 St Julian Grand Vin de Leoville du Marquis de las Casas this evening; it was a rare delight). But I like posting to this thread and will continue to do so. Essentially, I am looking at price structure, using the indicators for confirmation only. My starting point is the supposition that all moves (except V reversals) start from ranges, ie. price moves from the centre to the extreme, so I draw pivots through ranges as I trade and am looking for price structure that leads me to enter through these pivots. In the chart above, "my" ideal entry was at 1.3925 about 5 minutes earlier, but I missed it, so I took the triple break 10 ticks lower at 1.3915. I like to see QQE (which like the Klinger Volume version I use has ATR within its summation) continue to flow in my trade direction during a retracement, as occurred in this trade shortly before my entry. The exit on the exact low was pure luck . J. Edit : If you look at the Ninja chart in my post # 322, you will see a standard RSI + RSI MA : I also have this chart right under my TS chart, albeit with a different (Interactive Brokers) datafeed and tick count. Sometimes the market structure will be clearer on the Ninja chart : the IB datafeed filters more ticks, but as a result tends to be much faster with very little lag (if any) around news. I used to trade the fast charts directly from the Ninja charts, but as I am adding longer-term methods, I am trying to work out which account best to use for what...

HI K/J/Lizpet A nice tap down from this upper t/l coinciding with the 70 line and divergence, then a breakout of the lower line to keep it going. Still in this from 1.4190 with stop at 4160 now. The trendline and 40,50,60 etc levels keep it so simple. I find it has to be no longer than m5 for me but the lines must be drawn from obvious and clear highs and lows (highs and lows on rsi created by pronounced price high and lows as opposed to a spike low on rsi with flat price action). Hope you're all well and not too shocked to see the thread in the top 10 again. Andy

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi Andy, Nice to see you posting again. It seems as the 40 and 60 level are coming out in many of trading articles/books that I have been reading. I have looked at some charts and they do seem to play a big role in trending reversal and/or continuation. Again I will do my best to post some charts on 40/60 levels or the RSI trendlines. I hope all is well in health and business. Kareem

Don't blame me if you're just a sucker for the rsi. It just fits in that space at the bottom of the screen so well. Just got 12 short on eu on m5 down through the rsi 14 50 line.(see chart) Hit my limit last night at 1.4113 for 77 pips.(previous post , entry on rsi line break at 1.4190) Had 45 this morning short again through the news. She is being kind to me lately. Andy

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I got out of this for +12 short as it seemed greedy to go for more at this hour but just drew the rsi t/line on and realise this could be a big move if it holds. Coming up to 1.4000 though. lets see.

Bollinger Bands work well with the RSI I can't check your charts, but I'll bet that the Bollinger Bands had formed a throat about 4/5 bars back - expect an expansion in volatility i.e. a breakout and the RSI was in the 60 zone - expect a rebound, price still in a down move or at least a sideways movement until the RSI breaks above 60 when a new up move may start Just my two pence worth May be worth checking out? Happy pipping Peter

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Peter Thanks for the suggestion. I have spent months with bb and rsi and it just doesn't seem to be my perfect partner. I sometimes drop it on and also used a bbsqueeze indi for a while. I have john bollingers book and also subscribe to his free websites. One day it may look ok for me but for now the 9/21 cross and rsi line will do. I have posted this mornings trade short from 1.3970 for 20 points on a take profit order. M15 chart rsi tline break coupled with rsi 50 line (first aqua arrow). Look at the massive divergence on the two lows later on. The confirmation of the divergence for me would have been the break upwards of the 40 line on rsi. Also check out the way the pivots and mid points got tested today. I'm short now after a try of the 70 line and a possible break down of this trendline. entry 1.3985 stop 1.4025 tp 1.3950. lower stakes and larger stop/tp. Wish I had been at home for the 2nd aqua arrow. Andy

Got it. Never more than 9 points down, trade closed for +35. Look how the break of the t/line came down to test the lower/slower t/line and test the 40/60 levels. Check out M3 and pivot point touches. Nice start to the day when you wake up to that.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Nice trade Andy. I would use the rsi trend line to exit as well. It can keep you in good trades, longer. Kareem

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi K. I agree that can often be the case although once the line is broken down for a short we then have to wait for a pullback to give us two points to draw the down t/line to keep us in the trade. My entry and profit taking usually mean i'm out with profit before that pull back. Including the 35 overnight I am up 83 pips today. Had some on the upmove and 20 on the reversal from 1.4040. It was another nice line break after the rsi got really high and the price hit m4. How's your trading going? Andy

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi Andy, I am still unable to trade with work the way it is. Business is still slow and I have to work twice as hard for half the results. I will keep tying to get back into trading, and I will keep a look in the thread. I very glad that you are doing well. Kareem

--- 帖子 #371 ---
" I will stop experimenting with indicators, I will stop experimenting with indicators ..." I now have TRIX (thank-you, Edgetrader) with QQE and thanks to Andy, I have a close-only parabolic. No ema, no paintbar, just the 9 period channel that I find makes the chart easier to read. Horizontal lines are floor trader pivots.... ... but how much of it is really needed (see second chart) ?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Thanks for posting this. I've long been a fan of RSI and just recently discovered trading the rsi trendline breaks. I find that this works fine in its simple state actually. No complex indicators or cluttered charts. Just RSI and price works great for me. Again, thanks Kareem and Andy.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
... continuing my spell-binding discussion above, here are two charts of the same trade in progress (short 1.4054, partial at +10, stop moved to 1.4060 just above swing high). On chart 1 I have drawn a red vertical line at the "TRIX + QQE entry", which the close-only parabolic didn't agree with. My actual entry was based on a simple "123 triple break", a personal favourite. Chart 2 shows Kareem's RSI 21, which as I write is keeping me - just - in the trade, but has just caused me to lower my stop above that swing high 1 pip above my entry. But as I wrote earlier, would I have done anything different without the indicators ? I think not (and you know RSI is my fave). Please allow me to think out loud with you : my girls have headed south already and I am home alone for 10 days, back testing and trading...:nerd:

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Welcome Jdcompute, and thank you for the kind note. Please feel free to post any trades/charts in the future. Kareem

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Nice trade J, Nice to see that you are keeping the good old RSI. I am noticing a nice new set up on the RSI. I cannot remember were I got it from ( somewhere online) but it seems to work very well....so far. I will post some charts if it continues to work. The market this past week have been super choppy I think. Kareem

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi All. In light of the recent craze for multi coloured indis across the bottom of the screen I didn't want the RSI thread to not have been seen to make some sort of effort. I have attached a chart for your consideration. It uses RSI color indi set at 51 for green and 49 for red, blue between. Repainting. It will repaint only the current bar if it is hanging around the 50 level but on a 1 minute chart you won't have to wait long for it to stop or perhaps rewrite the code for me for nothing. I have used 14 and 21 to stop any arguments between myself and Kareem and a 34 as everyone elses has at least three. Do you think we should add more? Andy

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I don't know, Andy - if you'd remembered to attach the chart I could tell you... ?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hey J. It's there now .

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi Andy, It seems to work better than the ADX to show the trend. Nice set up. I guess we could always look at the last 20 bars, if there is more than 4 color changes, then we are choppying stay out. If not, we can just use the ( any ) ema to enter a trade. What do you think? Also can you please email me the indicator. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hi K It can show some good entries and building strength. I like it when it turns from green to blue for a few bars and then back to green after testing the 21 ema. I have also used it with 40 and 60 levels for the red/green and that shows much more commitment but with fewer entries. I also am using the double cci with sma I'll post a chart in the minute with both indis attached . Tell us more about the rsi thing you are working on. Come on, show us a picture. Andy

--- 帖子 #381 ---
It's so....... psychodelic .

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thankyou J. I achieved that look even without using purples or pinks. Think how it would look with some included. Leave that one with me . Andy

--- 帖子 #383 ---
heres the chart for you k.also attached the two indis and a template.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Here is a nice trade that I got into using RSI trendline break.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi traders this is a great thread, keep it up my contribution is a little MTF indi, it shows the RSI values over or below certain levels in different TFs.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Thanks Andy, I will post. It is very simple I just want to make sure it is for working. Kareem

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Nice trade Jd, I hope you were able to stay for another break for the exit. Thanks for the post

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Thanks Walb, how do you use MTF RSI, do you want to see all to green? Kareem

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Sure did my friend. I just love the simplicity of this system. I'm 15 for 15 so far using this. And you're right, the 20 pip SL is perfect. Any less would've stopped me out of some good trades and I personally don't like risking more than 20 pips anyway. This system fits my comfort zone just right. By the way, I'm in Fort Worth, TX and it seems that I read somewhere that you or someone else was in Dallas.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
at least 1min to 1h have to show the same color. strongest moves to be expected when all show the same.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi JD, I am in Rowlett. Only 15M(or 3 5M bars) from Dallas. What do you do in FW? Kareem

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Thanks, I will add to my tools. Kareem

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi I know it has been a while, and it will most probably be sometime before I do another one. I like to share this one with you. It looks promising, but please note it is only one week worth of testing (if you want to call this testing). The new set up still uses the trend lines to keep you in the trend longer/exit. Again, this is not my set up. I have read it somewhere and wrote down on a post-it note. Sorry I cannot remember where I got it from. I read everything with a RSI in it. Okay with this set up is also simple, you use the 14 RSI and the 200 SMA (Simple Moving Average). If the price is below the 200 SMA, then you set up your RSI (overbought/oversold) lines to 20/70, if the price is above 200 SMA then the RSI lines are 35/85. You can buy/sell once the RSI touches/crosses and hooks back from these (overbought/oversold) lines. That’s it. Feel free to post or give any feed back. I have posted some charts. In one you will notice the price at the 200 SMA. If that is the case, go watch batman re-runs, or walk the dog. And of course keep your stops to 20 as you also see that sometimes it is hit. Also note several times you ahead only 15-20 pips before it comes right back to resume its trend. So I would recommend moving to break even at +10 and locking some profit at +15-20. Kareem

--- 帖子 #394 ---
This one needed the 20 pip stop.

This one needed a break even move at +10

How did that trade work out for you?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hey JD It looks like that chart is from close of business friday. hartnet won't be doing anything until sunday night now. Andy.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Yes, that would be the plan for next Monday.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
.. I put the asymmetrical RSI back up as it shows divergence so well. This chart is late on Friday, long after I stopped for the day, but it shows a setup well. Still have the close-only parabolic on for trade hold, but it will go as QQE does that job better imho. TRIX or ARSI ? Hmm, that's difficult, TRIX is smoother, but the RSI levels and WMA crossover also have plenty to say... This setup, which is also a Trader Vic 2b setup ("double top higher high reject") shows a GREAT value of QQE (in addition to its trade hold virtues) : it crossed down on the retrace from the first swing high, but stayed uncrossed when the DT HH ws formed : a very strong sell confirmation. I haven't drawn the correct entry point... (which I'll leave strictly to "the imagination of the imaginer", as Frank Zappa used to say...) hehe... Thanks for posting your new RSI tests, K : I LOVE the clean charts, but am rather doubtful about the method at this stage.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi, do you take the rsi trend lines as counter trend and trend following trade entries? Do you still trade the ATM system?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi J, Vic 2B is very powerful signal. and yes it is confirmed by the divergences. Nice set up. Where do you get your TS indicators? The new set up is interesting, but I am still looking at it. I though I would post and see what you guys can notice. Kareem

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Mostly on the TSW forum (you need a TS8 account to access) : the ARSI code was in there somewhere and I added the WMA. PM or email me with what you'd like and I'll send it over (as you know Jurik and MTP stuff is locked to platform customer ID).

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I take the rsi trendlines as both counter trend and trend following. And yes! I will always trade the ATM system! This works with it so seamlessly.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I hereby claim the prize for posting the most variations of RSI to this thread. This is TrendRSI, another smoothed RSI, this time with ATR in the calculation. "In for observation".

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi J. You may hold that title but I think I post the most colourful. I found this one tonight . Its basically green above 50 and red below, except that it gets darker red and green as they get stronger. Andy

--- 帖子 #409 ---
This is another one I took around the London open.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Nice one JD, Nice break, nice trade.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi, I have added a few trendlines with more or less false signals. Why didn't you traded these breakes? It seems to me that drawing the trendlines on the rsi is rather subjective.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi McFly: Your point is well taken. Personally, I simply use the 50 level as the line in the sand when it comes to interpreting the RSI. Above 50, up trend, Below 50, down trend. I will never use the 1-min, 3-min 5-min time frames IF I didn't first gain perspective from larger intraday time frames. Many traders use the RSI as a scalping tool but in fact, it gives excellent indication to directional bias if we use them on the Daily, 240-min, 60-min, 30-min. And finally, this is also a personal way of utilizing the said indicator, I put heavy emphasis on patterns and Elliott wave structures instead of blindly drawing trend lines both on the bars and the indicator. And of course, my main tool is the Andrew's Lines as well. Apologize for putting up something which is out of context to this thread. Take care. Have a good one Jeff Edit: If we are incorporating price structures and patterns onto the analysis, the 5-min entries depicted aren't a trade setup at all. At best, it was a scalp short trade; with an obvious bullish stance in place for the said pair.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Jharteam, I would love to know more about things like Gartley patterns or volume trading but unfortunately I don't have the time atm to learn more about this stuff. Back to topic. What I noticed is when a new trend is established (2 higher lows or two lower highs) before a rsi trendline breaks you can go for 10 pips (EUR/USD). But I don't know if it's a robust idea.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Agreed your price and indicators are very visible. Can you kindly assist me to download the technical indicators? May you being bless with abundance of health, love and wealth.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
aida - do you have Tradestation &amp; if so, which indicators would you like ? J. PS. I leave for an extended vacation tomorrow, so not much time...

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Yes this set up can be subjective. The RSI trend line set up in here to give small advantage. Also my trading style always get me to break even at +10, do I get many BE trades. With this set up, I am trying to find the turning point and many times it would take several tries ( stops or BE stops) to do this. But once you do catch a turning point, you should ride it to the next breaking point. Thanks for the new posts. Kareem

--- 帖子 #417 ---
The popular and the most used timeframe is H1 The popular and the most used indicator is RSI The most profitable trade system is at H1 with RSI indicator Try it and you will understand that I am right! No stres no confusing, just trade two or three times a day. You can increase trading with different pairs. From today At least 50 pips from EUR/USD, you can try with different pairs and gain more. http://images.upload2world.com/get-7..._com_gmivs.gif or at M30 from EUR/USD http://images.upload2world.com/get-7...com_znlpep.gif

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi, I have included the rsi methodology in my main system (thv). The longer I use it the more confident I feel. I wanted to vote that this system is usefull but unfortunately I pressed the no button. I only want to add that it's very useful. Maybe you can delete my vote or change it.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I would like to thank everybody here for educating me on the use of RSI. You really made my day.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi All: Just an example of how the combinations of patterns, which are extremely important, and the RSI can generate buy / sell signals. As mentioned on my previous post; the 50-level line is the most important to gauge the posture of the market; long or short. It will provide the MOST explosive moves from there; NOT from the divergence plays. Take care. Have a good one Jeff

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Don't worry about it Mcfly. I cannot be changes. I like your post. please keep posting. Thanks

Hello andypips, could you please be so kind and explain how you use the trend cci indicator that you have attached, and / or refer me to where I can get more info on this indicator. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi Bluebull The indi is used in quite a few places but has been used and described in f4's journal. The longer term is the trend and the shorter term the entry/trigger. The sma which i use at 30 is more of a confirmation but still very important. All the relevant levels must be observed ie, 50,100, 200. The simplest way to use it is with the trend, so for a m1 chart use m15. If the trend is short then the trend cci wants to be below zero. Then wait for the signal cci to go above zero, try the 100 then back down through and continue the move. Also a zero line reject is good. There is a lot of cci info on woodies website for free. It is an indi that you have to get a feel for the rhythm of the market to use well. I also look for price the right side of the 9ema and use pivot points alot. I use it as my only indi apart from rsi now and then. I trade euryen only on m1 charts. You will need to play with different settings for the cci's for different pairs perhaps, but I would recommend you use the sma not ema and set it at 30 on the indi. I am getting around 50pips a day in 30mins with this method. Hope this helps Andy

--- 帖子 #433 ---
It sure did. I am very grateful for the info. May the Lord keep you and bless you. Ben.

Hi everybody, For anyone interested in the theory and application of the RSI the following books will be of help 1 Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional - Constance Brown - McGraw-Hill 2 RSI: The Complete Guide - John Hayden - Traders Press 3 RSI: Logic, Signals and Timeframe Correlation - Walter Baeyens - Traders Press Some good weekend reading???? Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif PS They do not use the RSI in the conventional manner!!

Thank you. That would be better for me

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi RSI ers, Any tips on exits? (much more important than entries!) Here's my tip of the day, hope someone finds it helpful. Long position: When the RSI breaks above the 80 level - trail a stop just under the low of each consecutive bar until you are taken out Doesn't work? Check it out! Sometimes in a really stong move you may be taken out prematurely , thats the risk we take, but if the RSI declines to the 80 or 60 level and rebounds - then we have another entry signal The aim is to be in the trade only when it is moving in our direction, and not let a winning trade become a loser The same philosophy can be used as the RSI approaches the other RSI S/R levels - if you are not taken out and the price continues higher - good you are still in an advancing trade Nothing is perfect, but if the above suits your trading "personality" thats great - otherwise ignore it Have a great day Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hi Lizpet, yes a few charts showing the set up would be great. Danny

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi Danny, Qqe Please read my post page 23, (339) The process is pretty straight forward, takes about 5 mins to set up the RSI S/R chart. Once you have done that, check it out against a few pairs/stocks etc. Its usefullness or otherwise should be obvious - if not - then simply move on, it either works for you or it doesn't - same as any other type of analysis - they all work, but any single type is unlikely to work for everyone. For me the RSI fits perfectly with my perception of trading i.e. it offers low risk trades (the spread between entry and the initial stop) your loss if the initial stop is hit is low Sorry Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif

I have read a lot where you mentioned. It was about divergence trendline, support resistance. I am just curious of what you use with rsi except cci 10. secondly you use RSI (9). Is it close, weighted close, typical price, high or low bla bla..? I will be happy if you answer Thank you QQE

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hi Qqe, Please refer to page 24 posts 346/347 I should have included CCI in 346 The RSI that I use is based on the closing price Trading should be easy, - if you have to search to find a signal on a chart, - then it is probably not there!!! Just trade the obvious and you will likely end up with a higher probability trade. If any of the statements which I have used in the past is not too clear (or doubtful), just ask and I will try to answer them (I do not check what I have written before hitting the "submit button") Have a nice weekend Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hi Peter, Thank you for answering. I try the way that you posted at 23th page. It is really profitable and stop loss is very small. There is a difference between you and me. You try it at both daily and H4 graphes. Actually I try it at both H1 and M30. Thank you very much for showing the way of success. My "forex" view has been changed Have a good day QQE

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Lizpet, I have been lurking in the background for a while. I have been researching your RSI S/R levels this week and really think that I will incorporate in my trading. I have ordered two of the books you reccomended, and will order the third RSI: Logic, Signals and Timeframe Correlation, after I finish the first two. Which is the most useful? I have backtested using the 40 level Support for longs and exiting when the RSI drops below the 60 level, and am really surprised how much of the move you capture. I have also noticed ( as you mentioned) one could also exit after the long passes back through the 40 level to get a huge winner. Vise versa for shorts. I have a question about entry positions. You mentioned in one of you posts that you can have a tight stop using this method. I have noticed when lets say you have a RSI bounce off the 40 level and it is a good bullish bar with no or very little tails that you could possibly position you stop 1/2 of the bar length. Am I on the right path? Would you mind sharing more information on your tight stop comment. I really appreciate you sharing this method. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi BlueBull I will explain briefly but if you need more then pm me as this isn't rsi.(saying that I added a 14rsi with a few line breaks shown on there) I use h/ashi and look for colour change away from sup or res. At the moment I am trading ey only but this may change. Only trading one pair allows you to learn its pulse. I find that using the m1 charts an entry can show from an ema cross, a cci zero line cross, a move away or back to the 200ema. One of the best is when we are in a nice move (let's say down)and the emas come back and kiss off each other without crossing. The h/ashi turns neg again and you enter short. Nice tight stop above emas if you have got it wrong. The cci would want to be below and rejecting the sma in this case. In the second chart this is shown by the arrow and the vert line.Also see how the cci tests the 50 and 100 here. The RSI also tests the 45 line and fails. Time for trading is usually 7 GMT through to 22 gmt ish. I am not full time at this every day yet so it varies. Some days 1 hr others 15 but usually about 7 to 8 hours. Best results for me at 7 to 10 gmt.The first chart shows three short and 4 long entries. These are m1 and I may only go for 5 each. I usually enter with a 20 tp and 20sl. if I see the momentum stalling then I'm out with what I get, average 10ish. these examples have little follow through and are post nfp. I did not trade after 9 this morning. I will let it run if looks good and can move my tp quick enough. Other days it may be 5 or 10 all day long. On the m1 I pretty soon realise if we're in for a ranging day with little follow through. Not very brief was it. 2 pictures for those of you fed up reading though. Hi Kareem. How's it going? JTrade is away in Italy I believe selecting some nice wine for christmas probably. Hope this explains. Andy

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Hi Danny and Qqe Hope Lizpet doesn't mind , I'll post one explaining what I think He means. Excuse my artwork, it's not the best. I chose H1 on ey and rsi9 as peter trades longer time frames than me. Once over the 80 level on rsi start moving up the stop as per the red lines each time a new candle is opened. You can see it would have closed out on the start of the second white candle. The same would apply to a smaller time frame. I personally use a moving average but will give this method more screen time. We know we are in very overbought territory so candle by candle is probably a better way. Cheers Andy

Hi Tarco, Books I found Constance Brown and John Hayden books , which I read ages ago, very helpful in defining up and down trends From this info the RSI S/R levels became obvious as did the start and end of a trend Baeyens book: I found it interesting, but his use of RSI channels did not work for me When I read a book, I always have my trading software running so that I can check what is being said against my own charts to see if it is "workable" for me I could not get his channels to work as I could not find many hidden divergencies - that was checking against ASX stocks, it may be different for Forex? Anyway, I did not finish the book, It does offer many sample charts to explain his findings Entries/Stops The risk that you are comfortable with is what determines where you set your initial stop Personally I set my stop just below the low of the signal bar - and I NEVER lower it. Exits - I never set targets, I take what the market offers - once in a trade and it moves in my direction, I treat each RSI resistance level as a possible exit (I can only trade long) and move the stop to just below the price bar as the RSI approaches resistance - if it goes thro resistance - good - and repeat for the next resistance level - once past 80 (no further resistance levels) I place my stop below each consecutive bar until I am taken out 40 levels a Uptrend RSI levels 40/80 A level of 40 indicates a possible bottoming formation within an uptrend (if it drops below 40 then there is the likelyhood of a trend change!) b A level of 80 and above indicates a possible topping formation within an uptrend (if it falls to 80 or 60ish and rebounds, we have a retracement, and a signal to re-enter Another reason to move my stop below the current bar is when the RSI gives a bearish divergence, and talking about divergence - if I should encounter a hidden divergence - then I will add to the position! The RSI passing up thro 60/65 level usually indicates a breakout from consolidation - if you use Bollinger Bands - they will be showing a narrow throat, this is the start of a new uptrend If the Bollinger Band throat is wide when the RSI passes up thro 60/65- this could indicate a trend continuation If the Bollinger Band throat is wide as the RSI passes up thro 40, this could indicate a new trend following a large retracement from a previous up move. The trend is confirmed when the RSI passes up thro 60/65 Hope this helps Tarco I have probably repeated myself from previous posts - just put it down to old age http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Hi Andy, Thanks for the chart http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif - thats exactly how I would have traded it once the RSI went above 80. Also on your chart, I would have had a stop below the 7th - 9th bar in from the left, as the RSI approached 80 - just incase the 80 acted as resistance and rejected the upmove - as you can see this level was never taken out and the RSI proceded on its merry way Hope the above gibbering makes sense Have a nice weekend Peter

At the end, I realize that the forex and other markerts based on RSI S/R (20,40,60,80 points). Maybe because of the reason that it has been an old indicator and used by many traders. As peter mentioned, it is really guidence to follow the trend. Thank Peter, karem40 and other friends to make me get what really RSI is..

Hi, For those interested, I just noticed that I did not include another reason for taking an exit. i.e. If the move is up and it has crossed up thro a RSI resistance level, if it should then decline and drop back down thro this level (now support) - this would also qualify as an exit. Just trade the RSI R/S levels as you would price R/S! Although I can only trade long, I am quite happy to take a long trade on a down trend rally/trend change. i.e. In a confirmed downtrend - RSI has fallen below the 40/35 level, rallied back up and bounced of the 60/65 level. If it falls back to the 20 level (i.e. forming a bottom within a downtrend), I would place an entry just above the high of the current price bar, and away we go again if the RSI bounces. All this may look a bit confusing so why not just draw the RSI CHART and add all the R/S levels that I have mentioned in earlier posts and play around with it - colour code the up trend levels in green and the down trend levels in red and the 50 level in black, and just check out what I have mentioned in the various posts - It could turn out to be a profitable way to spend a Sunday OR MAYBE NOT http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon8.gif The info in my posts are probably a bit disjointed - thats just me, I know what I want to pass on, but somehow I'm not that hot at explaining things. Sorry for any confusion caused, old age does not come on its own Don't worry - be happy, its only money! Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Thank you for your reply. I use bollinger bands and RSI now after studying your RSI channels. I like the simplicity of the charts using these two inidcators and believe that this combination gives a very good represention of the market. I am trying to find my style of trading and believe that I will continue to work with a similar way of trading as yours. I appreciate your posts here and hope you continue to add your valuable comments. I have googled RSI channels and there are not many people using this method as far as I can tell. So your comments and replies are very much appreciated. You are explaining things very well. Have a good weekend. Tarco

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I have a quick question if you do not mind. Do you ever consider the sharpness or pointedness (not a very good use of english but not sure how to describe it) of the RSI bounce as affirmation of an entry? As opposed to a curved or rounded bounce from a SR level Thanks and have a good weekend. Tarco

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi Tarco, Thanks for the appreciation. In answer to your query - I would say a sharp bounce of a level is more decisive (more commitment) than a "rounded" bounce which to me shows a lack of conviction and some uncertainty. Bollinger Bands: A good book on Bollinger Bands, I think, is "Dynamic Technical Analysis" - Philippe Cahen - Wiley Trading - its a French translation,but very good. In my opinion much better than Bollinger on Bollinger Bands which I found quite basic Cahens book describes the various Bollinger Band formations and how to trade them!. It about 130 pages - but no story telling, just facts Back to the RSI Here's something to consider: Once you check out the RSI S/R levels and think they may have potential - the next step most traders take is to start adding filters to "increase their edge" The obvious filter would be to compare RSI S/R with Price S/R E.G. horizontal S/R trendlines, channels, Fibonacci levels patterns etc etc - oh and while you are at it why not check out to see if your signal coincides with some form of candlestick reversal bar(s)?------------ there is no end to this futility for the dedicated analyst!!!! A truth often said is that we humans have an inherent capability to complicate everything that we touch!! If you beleive that you have more chance of "guessing" where price will be on the next bar as opposed to say 5 bars from now - why not just use the "system" you used to find the original signal and apply it to a higher time frame? Timeframe analysis gives you the underlying structure of your "market". Get your timeframes in alignment and you have the probability of tuning into BIG moves! I'm away to look for some inspiration, if only I can find my long lost crystal ball http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif Its my turn to cook Sunday dinner, so I'll have to go and study the recipe - Pork Belly a la Pierre (can't let Liz beat me) Cheeri Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Don't know whats come over me, all this posting. Put it down to idle hands and too much spare time! Anyway here's another thought for to-day This is only my opinion Why does S/R work - they are psychological levels that we humans tend to gravitate towards I can understand why this is so with Price S/R, but don't quite get it with RSI S/R - but they work for me and thats all that matters Where is the logic in Fibonacci levels? they also work for some of us The beauty of RSI S/R is that the levels are set - we have no input other than setting the zone levels (same as is done with price S/R)I.E. THE s/r level +/- value With price S/R the technician has an input in deciding which are the relevant points thro which his S/R lines are drawn - and we all know that not everyone sees a chart in a similar manner - for instance if you have not recognised a certain pattern before as being significant, then you will not see it when you look at a chart which contains it (although you recognise later that this pattern is significant) So there is the posibility of drawing your S/R lines at not the best levels - also you are going to get heaps of possible S/R levels - which are the important ones? Maybe you decide that to cut down your options you only take the levels that have proved to be both support and resistance in the past? Other signals RSI easily picks out trend weakness and strength thro divergence with price whereas with price only, its not so simple and takes a lot of experience RSI can give signals before they are detected on pure PA and they also sometimes give late signals - swings and roundabouts The RSI trace lends itself to line analysis similar to price but with less "noise" i.e. trendline, patterns, dow theory etc (never tried Fibonacci?) RSI levels are great for scanning for trades You could scan a universe of thousands of instruments in the matter of a couple of mins to pick out candidates worth deeper analysis Good trading http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif Peter PS For the IT buffs interested in the RSI - it could possibly be useful if they could know the price required for a certain RSI level to be hit i.e. on the RSI chart - if they hover their mouse over a certain RSI level - up would pop the price required to give this RSI value--------- just me day dreaming - completely clueless when it comes to programming - in my day using a slide rule was considered cool!

Thanks again for your reply. I have been testing RSI channels with round numbers price action, pivot zones. I agree totally with your previous post about the RSI benefits vs Price action, the static levels of RSI seem to make things a little simpler for my thick skull anyway. For the past four or five months I have been studying nothing but price around key levels i.e. round numbers, flip zones, s/r and fibonacci. Basically trying to find some confluence or multiple reasons to get in a trade. The problem I have trading naked with no indicators is my exit. With all the potential S/R levels that I see with the above mentioned studies, I see too many obstacles for price to bust through. I think RSI is a great guide to help you hang on to your winners. Like you said since it is static you can easily develop a system of exiting and repeat the process each time you trade. You mentioined earlier that you move your stop behind the low of the bars as price approaches the RSI levels. Lets say you are long and price goes through the 60 level and your stop in below the corresponding bar that busted through the 60 level. So your RSI is between the 60/80 level. Do you keep your stop there until you approach the 80 level or do you continue to trail? Hope you do not mind the quesitons. Thanks, Forrest (Tarco)

Hi Forrest, Qge Forrest, I would not leave my stop at the low of the bar that "busted thro" - I would move it to just below the resistance line "busted line" (now support) It's good to see that you find RSI S/R useful, I'm sure you and other RSI enthusists in this thread can develop and improve it - I'm just happy to have planted a "seed" Kareem and Andy have good experience, are good at explaining things and backing it up with sample charts, so I'll just back off now and watch from the sidelines. If its of any help - I found the RSI hidden divergence to be the most reliable signal and ALWAYS worth taking I notice from your Qqe and Forrests charts (couldn't make out the writting but what you were saying looked to be obvious from your markings on the charts) that hidden divergence seem to occur quite regularly - lucky you, on my stock charts they are not so frequent Hitting the home runs: Use multi timeframe analysis!! RSI S/R is a simple system that works in all market conditions - you just have to find your own way in defining how you grade your signals, which ones to take and which ones to be a bit wary of Basic trading Thank you Kareem for starting this thread Happy (profitable) trading Peter

Hi Guys, Sorry for not posting for a while, but as you all know I have a full time job. Work has been very busy, and results are not as busy. I had to ,and will continue to, focus on my current job for now as I am unable to be a full time trader yet. But I might be forces to become one soon if my sales stay the same! I am doing some trading, but I only use the 4H chart (and the RSI of course) to trade with. It is still the old lines and divergences. I use long stops and target and look at my charts 10M per day to see where I stand. So far I am still at break even. I like what you have done with all the posts and I hope it will continue. I will do my best to post some of my 4H set ups. Thanks to all for watching and keeping up with the thread. I have always believed that that more you give in life, the more you will get. Kareem

Sorry, it was not my intent to sell anything. The only reason I signed my name was that someone had mentioned in an earlier post my website and I wanted to authenticate that I was that person. Rather than post my website I posted my books. It probably wouldn't matter how I said it or what I said because that is how many of these forums are. Everyone gets so defensive. I have spent years researching this and have spoken with Andrew Cardwell often. He is respectively regarded as the leading person on RSI. He is aware of my website and has reviewed my book. You couldn't know what is in it and it's value if you haven't read it. I have a great deal of interest in RSI. Incidentally I became aware of this forum by seeing that many members had come to my site of which I am appreciative and I thought it would be helpful to you to have someone that has spent so much time researching RSI. I apologize and will no longer waste your time. Paul

--- 帖子 #465 ---
More to the point: Are you aware what Andrew Cardwell refers to as reversals? If you don't or aren't interested then you are missing one of the strongest signals that RSI has to offer. paul

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I never said no one gets it. My post was just saying that after reading the entire post there were things people did not understand. I didn't ask anyone to buy my book. I only used the name to authenticate who I was in reference to an earlier post. My trading process is not "relabeled patterns" as I do not know what that means. There are significant points on RSI that after reading the forum posts it appeared the traders here were unaware of.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
One of the things that RSI does is key into momentum in the market. That is the major function. When you trade RSI you look for these momentum changes in what are called reversals or continuations. These are not the same as divergences. Most divergences lead to the opposite result. In other words most negative or bearish divergences lead to higher prices. In the chart I provided, price on the AUDUSD climbed almost 500 pips. All of the purple dashed lines are negative divergences that actually force price higher as they are small retracements, some so insignificant that they can create many losses to traders thinking price has reversed. Understanding this one fact can save you lots of money. Divergences are pre-signals that momentum is getting ready to make another thrust in the opposite direction (most of the time). That is the confusion with trying to say that RSI is overbought at 70 and oversold at 30. You can find places where this is true but you find many places where price stays overbought for long periods of time. Once the real signal has formed the next step is simple price action determination. Is the continuation signal confirmed by buyers and sellers in the market? There is no need to read candlesticks. What you are doing as a retail trader is making an attempt to understand where institutional traders are beginning to place their orders. They do not dump the whole load at once. They also defend price positions which is the reason you see support and resistance. One way to monitor momentum in the entire market is have a way that momentum signals can alert you on every time frame. You can do this (manually) on a number of pairs in one time frame, say 12 and when more than half are giving the same signal in the same time frame you know that something is happening. Now if you multiply that to include the 15 minute and the hourly then you will get a earlier warning. I hope this makes sense. I would be happy to articulate an areas that seem unclear. There is much more when it comes to RSI.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I noticed reference to channels on RSI. Below is the AUDUSD. RSI is read in slanted channels. The arrow locations shows where RSI momentum accelerates into the next level in these descending channels. If RSI were to stay in one of these channels and not move to the next then a "true" reversal or Range Shift would occur and the channels would change direction and move into ascending channels.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I would like to know what the strongest RSI reversal signal is, if you would like to share and/or post a chart. AZ

--- 帖子 #470 ---
There are two. Positive and Negative Reversals. The Positive Reversal has a lower RSI value at the second point and a higher price. The Negative Reversal has a higher RSI value and a lower price. If you look at the chart preceding this post, the Negative Reversals are in the Red and the Positive are green. Cardwell defined these as reversals and out of respect for his discovery I refer to them by that as well. However, they do not reverse the trend, they are signals that accelerate the trend or continue it. I prefer continuations. An example of this is on the daily chart of the EURUSD in late July of 2008 price dropped 2000 points before the first daily reversal appeared. Price then dropped another 2400 points where a cycle of continued positive divergences drove price up again. At the moment a wedge of positive and negative divergences is forming and is in the upper range that is appropriate for bullish trends. If one was trading the hourly, they would look for reversals that favored that possibility. Paul

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Thanks for taking the time to type it out for me. To me there seems that this style could leave alot of gray areas for interpretation. I like my charts to be alittle cleaner with less confusion "KISS". It may work for you and great, but I trade more like you stated before with using channels. If RSI has not crossed the channel/trend line, no trade. Thanks for sharing, AZ

RSI chart

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Your channels are actually pretty good from the chart you have drawn. Not exactly like Baeyens proposes but effective. I think Baeyens helps the discussion about RSI but I am not sure I totally agree with his method of drawing them. From the chart that you are showing the RSI momentum is narrowing at this point to where some kind of break should occur.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Are you refering to Cardwell's Momentum Discrepancy Reversal Points (MDRP)? Some call this hidden divergence. I have found discrepancies in what some call hidden divergence. But what I have researched, they are basically the same thing. Please let me know if you have a different understanding. Basically Cardwell's MDRP is a trend continuing confirmation, e.g. if you have an uptrend and your price gives higher lows and your RSI gives you lower lows this is what Cardwell refers to as MDRP. I have always recognized this as hidden divergence. I might be using the term hidden divergence in error but I have researched several sources and I think that Cardwell's (MDRP and hidden divergence are the same thing. I have only a limited study with RSI so I might be wrong, but this is my understanding. I do think that the above is more powerful than regular divergence at tops and bottoms. thanks, Tarco

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Tarco, Yes from your description it sounds as if you are describing them correctly. Cardwell also refers to them as Positive and Negative Reversals. A negative divergence most commonly will push price into a Positive Reversal and vice versa. These are the power behind understanding RSI. Once you identify them it is important which signals are best to take. Trading them in the direction of the trend will result in fewer false signals and much better results. In two months of trading the USDCAD with the trend the signals produced over 1200 pips. Paul

[quote=Moxie;2950619]Hi AZ, new to forex so be gentle, can you write your trading set up in a format like steps one,two,three kinda deal so I might be able to get my head around it.. sorry for been a pain, also do you trade this live..to many guys on here posting trading systems that they made up on the bus on there way home from work.. thanks for posting your charts.. Moxie.. Its as basic as what the tread starter (Kareem40, bless you ) tells you in the 1st couple posts. I had read alittle about this type of trading, but untill kareem started this tread in never really tried it. It is the RSI 21 and make a trend line with it, sound so easy. Now the hard part is knowing if you have it drawn right and the signal you are getting is not a fake one. This is done by studing the movement of the RSI and price, sad to say it might take you some time to become good at it. As you can see from the 1 min charts sometime it is real easy to spot and other days I wont make a trade because it is not a clear line, so I just keep my money untill there is no question about a trade set up. Once you have traded this way for awhile you will also notice some patterns in the RSI (1 min, 5 min) that you cannot see in the price, and lets you know if triggered you will make some pips. The RSI 21 is the bulk of my signal. I also use a 14 period volitility indicator to see what the price swings are doing. I really believe in the HH &amp; LL in price swings to put me in and out of the trades. The 1 min chart setups are always for 10 pips and the 5 min setup are for 20 pips. The MACD on my charts is just for looks No really, I look at it alittle but does not really effect if I take a trade or not, just a look into momentum is all. Anything more just ask, but you should start from the 1st post. AZ As I was like you at one point in time (not that I'm an expert) you are picking a hard road to go down with FX trading, But you have pick a good place to start. There are alot of good people at the FACTORY and most were willing to share and teach. You should listen to them all, and then, figure out what works for you and only you. Once you have it mastered you must do one thing "PAY IT FORWARD". Thanks

Hi AZ, We normally tend to use a trendline break to action a trade. Have you considered taking a trade in the direction of the current move, i.e. enter on a retrace and bounce of the trendline, and staying with it until it finally breaks thro the trendline Just a suggestion, as you said use what works for you, (but always have an open mind) http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif Peter

1. The RSI is set to record all Positive Reversals and Negative Reversals the Range specified for bullish and bearish reversals. 2. The Red arrow points to the first point of the RSI. If you look closely you will see RSI has climbed to a mountain top and is headed down the other side creating peaks as it does so and a deep valley. Knowing where these peaks are in relation to Reversals will let you in “early” on trades which is an aggressive method of trading but should bring 40% winning trades with practice and much higher profits than that if you are closely monitoring losing trades. 3. Once the valley was finished there was a new mountain being created and new peaks leading to the current entry. 4. Not every peak on the inside of a valley will lead to lower prices and not every valley in a rising mountain will lead to higher prices.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
1. Point 1 is the peak of the mountain on RSI. 2. Climbing down the mountain there are points where we see through the RSI and our own analysis of where the mountain peaks are formed. 3. Once the mountain has been formed a valley forms, and a new mountain is in place. 4. The purple circles are all entry points for the aggressive RSI trader. More conservative points can also be used. 5. Point 2 is the possible new peak and a good place to take all or part of the profit. In this case 114 pips. 6. Not every peak on the inside of a valley will lead to lower prices and not every valley in a rising mountain will lead to higher prices.

Lots of great posts and charts while I've been basking by a pool in the Tuscan hills these last few weeks... I promised my wife not to work, not even look at a single email, but she couldn't stop me contemplating over and over on how to simplify my intraday setup. I made this very naked chart this morning - any idea what's what (marking deliberately covered up) ?

--- 帖子 #508 ---
The answer is that I made a simple line chart and then swapped the asymmetric RSI with price, ie. ARSI above, price below... they are so similar, I wondered why use both... Here are two untampered-with charts - the vertical line marks exactly the same time point in each (both are 89 tick GBP futures). The ARSI shows a centreline and of course can show price divergence, but I'm going to trade the price chart only for awhile. Remember also that a line chart can and will have been places not shown on the chart, as the intrabar highs and lows are only shown as they are hit, not after the fact. Food for thought.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi Paul, Ref your posts 505/506 above Your posts are full of riddles - why not just tell us in plain English what you are saying? e.g Not every peak on the inside of a valley (downtrend) will lead to lower prices, and not every valley (trough) in a rising mountain (upmove) will lead to higher prices ----------BUT WHEN THEY FORM HIDDEN DIVERGENCE, ITS HIGHLY LIKELY ! Here's another that perhaps someone can help me with? PT2 "Climbing down the mountain (downtrend?) there are points where we see through the RSI and our own analysis of where the mountain peaks are formed" ??????? Is this saying that the downmove can be used somehow to determine the future up move peak? (other than fibonacci?) if so how? Anybody - any other interpretations? One thing about Pauls posts - they give us something to think about http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon8.gif Regards Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Aren't these candles just based on Moving Averages rather than real price action bars. I'm not a programmer but from what I could tell that looks like the case. If they are then they will be a lagging indicator useful only in a trend and not useful in consolidation. Plus any trade entry will be late and there will be many false signals.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Some of the best teachers teach in riddles. I'm not trying to hide anything but were I to explain in detail every aspect of trading RSI it would end up being a book. And I am not sure everyone here wants to hear what I have to say. Here was your first question: Not every peak on the inside of a valley (downtrend) will lead to lower prices, and not every valley (trough) in a rising mountain (upmove) will lead to higher prices . That is true. When you have RSI dropping down into the bearish range for RSI (60-20) there is a good chance that the peaks that are being formed are entry points for moves to the downside and not all will accelerate. The opposite is true when you are inside the "cave" and price is moving up. The trader has to decide which situation he/she is in. This is more aggressive then waiting for Negative Reversals and/or Positive Reversals (which have been called hidden divergences but they are more correctly called continuations.) You can Google Reversals on RSI - I think I already explained these in an earlier post. Having said that, a trader learning to trade this way; Andrew Cardwell, Constance Brown, Walter Baeyens and John Hayden, needs to learn the steps to trading conservatively. That means being able to identify all the reversals and divergences on the chart as they tell a story. I don't necessarily agree with all of the findings of the above authors. I agree the most with Cardwell but don't like the periods he uses for his moving averages. My moving averages are set for what most people say that institutional traders use but they do not have the final say in my trading. Baeyens book is about channels. The most significant thing about his book is that channels exist. The relevance is, if you draw the channels, they move in descending channels when price is rising and ascending when price is falling. Movement of RSI into the next channel depending on direction signals an increase in momentum and a continuation of the trend. Brown does not give you any information that you can't get from Cardwell and Baeyens. Unfortunately Cardwell's course costs $9000.00 for both courses and Baeyens book teaches you very little about trading RSI. Hayden's book is really not much help. Second question PT2 "Climbing down the mountain (downtrend?) there are points where we see through the RSI and our own analysis of where the mountain peaks are formed" ??????? This is somewhat cryptic and I apologize but it is saying about the same thing as the above. I traded Reversals/continuations for about 8 months which you can do successfully with tight risk and great reward potential, sometimes 20 to 1. But there are many false signals. Understanding price action bars helps significantly plus the basic fundamentals of Dow futures before the open, Dow and S&amp;P after the open and gold and oil. All of these factors can lead to significant profits on hourly charts. Yesterday I took 4 trades and made 360 pips. Today there was little movement in the markets, so it was a good day to stay out. There are two points to a reversal/continuation. Pt1 is the first point, Pt2 is the confirmation point where the trader decides if conditions are right for the trade. Recently I have been attempting to locate entries at successful Pt1s as these location are where price and momentum are pretty much 100% in correlation. You also mentioned Fibonacci. I am very proficient with them but they are not dependable in my mind due to the fact that they can be drawn from many locations, so many in fact that you can just about make them say what you want them to say. The most important thing about Fibonacci Ratios is that if they locate a level of resistance or support that it lines up with previous resistance and support. I seldom draw them except in situations where it is clear that I might be able to use 3 to find a point of confluence. I hope that helps.

Hi Paul,Thankyou for the nice explanations.You said no one here wants to hear what you say.I think many here want to hear what you say.Atleast I for one will be keenly watching your posts. Regards

Hi Paul, Thank you for the reply Divergence A lot of confusion is created by the various names given to the 4 main types of divergence - and thats a pity Divergence is not unique to the RSI, it can be related generally to oscillators. I don't care who first discovered divergence and named them - They are a great trading tool! For more types and info. on divergencies - have a look at www.trading-naked.com/Divergencies.htm . The RSI is my feel good comfort tool, could probably trade without it, but habits die hard. The RSI S/R and divergence suit me just fine. Nice and simple and plenty of trading opportunities - qualify them with price action and trade them with discipline - what more do you want? (nothing is perfect) The best signals are the obvious ones i.e. the ones that you do not have to search for Take care Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Yes you are right ,but seems to work well on higher timeframes , try 1H gbpusd . Anyway just experimenting , has nice colours I'm everyday more confident using rsi , I don't have much time to dedicate trading ,but i hope one day will became a fulltime job I like to enter on this kind of retracement and breakouts using rsi and slope direction line (give me faith on reading candlestick patterns) ,with tp 15 eurgbp and 20 gbpusd, and r:r at least 1:1 .Seems to work for me. I'm always opened to hear advices

Note where the RSI broke way before the price did. Target is .6715. My original stop was at the break of the 70 level of the RSI. Note RSI came back to test the trendline. Price should the same shortly. Kareem

--- 帖子 #518 ---
The price did test the trendline then continued down. The stop should be moved to 10 pips above the price trendline and target is still the same .6715 ( the next resistance level).

Trendline and support is being re-tested. If it does hold, then the target should be reached. There is two lines of support at this level, so it should hold. Kareem

Hi Qqe, I cannot day trade currently. My job requirement has changed and travel makes it very hard to watch/trade the 5M chart. The concept is still the same, the 4H seems to follow the same set ups so far. I just have to get used to trading smaller and using larger stops/targets. Also 4H seems to less stressful so far. Kareem

Trendline re-tested and a nice divergence usdcad this morning

--- 帖子 #523 ---
another divergence , live trade

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi Gavril, Hope Kareem does not mind a slight highjack. Ref #523 I notice that you use Bollinger Bands - they can tell you when a move is over. You have confirmation of the end of a breakout move from a narrow Bollinger Band throat, when the Band nearest to the price flattens or turns. Also the trend is weakening when the price breaks outside the bands and retraces to make another low inside the bands So in your above example - the Bollinger Bands have confirmed that the down move is over. Isn't hindsight wonderful - but anyway something which may prove useful in future? Have a nice weekend Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hi mister ! Your posts here are always very usefull

I trade with both RSI and Stoch. I think, it is best for me even though I have searched many ways of trading.. When Stoch's signal is same with RSI trendline signal, i trade with no doubt. Divergence is my second choice. At least 150 pips in three trades as an example... . http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8458/35059645.th.gif

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hey man could you clarify what you mean by stoch applying rsi?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi Qqe, (I trade daily charts) I used to use the stoch but found it very "noisy' - to overcome this I set it to 45 periods so that it just picked out the main moves. Have you tried the RSI/CCI combination? RSI operates between 0 - 100 whereas the CCI is unbounded, but it tends to have limits to which it will travel in an uptrend and limits it will travel to in a downtrend (just put the crosshairs of your mouse across the historical peaks and troughs to get each pair/stocks limits. (obviously it does not work every time but it is a very good guide) Application When using the RSI S/R lines for entries and exits, the CCI can be used to help filter out possible false entries and help with exits E.G. If the RSI is approaching 80 and the CCI is at/near its "peak level", then there is a good chance that the RSI will be rejected at the 80 level and say the RSI is breaking out above the 60/65 level and the CCI is at / near its "peak level", the odds are that the breakout will not amount to much (if anything) etc, etc, etc. and the CCI is pretty sensitive to divergencies, between the RSI and the CCI you will pretty much catch most if not all divergencies Check it out Peter PS As I mentioned above I trade the daily charts using RSI(9) AND CCI(10)

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi Sim, English is not Qqe's native language. He is saying that when he has agreement between his Stoch signals and his trendline signals - he is confident in taking a new trade Qqe, hope you do not mind me answering for you Peter

Hi Peter, Thank you for clarifying. Actually it is my third language that i learnt. What you wrote is what i mean. I will try CCI 10 Have a good day

Trendline breakout and divergence on gbpusd daily show us a change in the price direction

--- 帖子 #533 ---
There is a bearish divergence , rsi drops and find suport at 40 level ( uptrend ) ,if we have a bounce from 60 level,with cci overbought , is a sign that the trend changed

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi Gavril, The two trend commencement levels are RSI(9) 40 and 60 We go below 40 we have the start of a downtrend, if we have follow through We go above 60, then we have the start of an uptrend, if we have follow through. Trading between 40/60 normally signifies a sideways price movement (unless, for say an uptrend we have a trend reversal from a major correction, in which case the RSI will pass straight up thro the 40/60 level) Regarding your above chart The last time the 40/60 levels were breached, was a bullish move above 60, so it will not become a down move until the 40 level is breached to the downside If it bounces between 40 and 60 - then it will be range trading (sideways) The above is just my opinion, probably different from most - but it works for me http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Regarding divergence Look for bearish divergence around the RSI 80/60 levels Look for bullish divergence around the 20/40 levels Bullish Hidden divergence primarily occurs around the 80/60 levels Bearish Hidden divergence primarily occurs around the 20/40 levels Hope the above is useful to someone As always,keep your losses to a MINIMUM Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

I still have a lot to learn about trading , and this advices for me are gold. I entered short this morning . What do you think about countertrend trading ? Thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi Gavril, I notice that you use both the RSI and the CCI - which I think is a great combination - they are both momentum type indicators but derived from different formulaes (obviously) - so if one "misses" a trade, there is a good chance that the other will pick it up - especially on divergencies! As I have mentioned earlier, I do not trade Forex. I trade my super fund on stocks (I am not allowed to trade Forex). So I do not have access to Forex charts unless they are posted here. Referring to your chart (GBPUSD, daily) above The last good trade shown a good bullish divergence on the CCI and a so so divergence on the RSI (the last two troughs below -100 on the CCI) The CCI also gave a bearish divergence with the last two peaks above 100 on the CCI, which also coincided with a pin bar whose tail was rejected by the upper channel line that you have drawn on the price chart. The last bar resulted in the RSI trendline being breached to the downside and the RSI is now at the 60 level zone, so everything looks to be bearish The RSI 60 level is a possible support level, who knows, but the odds are good for a downmove Hind sight analysis is pretty good, hey! anybody can do it. Unfortunately its the right hand edge of the chart that counts and can create doubt Gavril, If you are relatively new to trading a must read is "Trade your way to Financial Freedom (Second Edition) by Van Tharp In it he details what are the most important factors for successful trading, and its NOT entries.

The Forex charts which I see posted here seem to show much more trending activity than what we get on the stock market I have an open mind regarding trading and I am always looking for ways to improve my edge, and FF seems to be the place to be - so much info readily shared, traders helping traders, great!

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Kareem, Your original basis of this thread is based on RSI trendlines For trending markets: How do you know which RSI pivots to draw the RSI trendline through? You probably don't? - Until you get a trendline break - if it has been drawn correctly, the trendline break should coincide with a directional change of Dow Theory of the RSI pivots?? So whats the point in drawing trend lines across RSI peaks or troughs?. Why not just apply Dow Theory to the RSI peaks or troughs? The RSI makes it very easy to pick out peaks and troughs (based on close etc), than using the basic price chart - unless you are an experienced chartist Price is king and RSI helps us "see" whats happening. Just a thought - check it out Regards Peter http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Just to add to the above post For rangebound or consolidating markets: i.e. price is range bound/consolidating when the RSI is "stuck" between the RSI(9), 40 zone-60 zone band This is a good place to draw trendlines to identify chart patterns e.g. triangles, rectanges etc which may lead to a breakout to trending / or simply to trade within the range limits. When the RSI is trading between the 40/60ish zone levels, it can be a bit more difficult to interpret as the trace may in fact be trending and is passing through the rangebound zone and up through the 60 ish level and thus confirm an uptrend . For an uptrend the trace may have originated from a major retracement or downtrend "V" reversal (which would originate from the 20ish level) For a downtrend the opposite applies If this is a concern, a consolidation can easly be confirmed by using a non directional type indicator such as the ADX(10), a value below 25/20 signifies weak price action which is not capable of trending. Hope the above makes sense???????????????? As usual, always check out anything that I or anyone else says before committing to using it! If you use indicators - you should always know how/when to use them and what market conditions they work best in Price is still king Trade well Peter

Hi Dave, As soon as it breaks. which should break before the price trendline. Thanks Kareem

Here is a trade I took Sunday night. I am currently using 2 and 4H charts. I found that 2H charts work best for if you not have the time or wish to day trade. Please note the first trade ( long) did not work out. But I did moved my stop to break even after 20 pips and was out, but the second seems to working very well...so far. Again my stop is at BE now. Again note how the RSI breaks before the price trendline does. I will update tomorrow. Kareem

--- 帖子 #548 ---
But I have to go. I have but in a limit order at the 1.0050 price support level, which is also a RSI trendline support as well. Stop still at BE. I Will check it out tomorrow morning. Good night. Kareem

--- 帖子 #555 ---
hI Kareem, Nice to see you back, I've primarily been interested in trading the RSI S/R levels and divergencies, but have recently been checking out the potential of using RSI trendlines, and therefore the associated RSI pivots - and it looks very promising. It has always been my belief that all similar type signals do not offer the same potential $ return, i.e. some are better than others! In the case of trendlines where they occur in the RSI 0-100 range. Keep up the good work Peter PS I liked how you undated your trend line to get the maximum $ return. Basically, I look at trendlines similar to you. You can draw a trendline as soon as you have 2 pivot highs or lows and that is the current correct trendline. If price accelerates, the RSI trace will move at a steeper angle, when a pivot forms and it cannot be connected to the start point of the inital trend line without passing thro the RSI trace, then we draw a new trendline from the new pivot to the nearest pivot to the left (which will be the 2nd pivot used to draw the inital trendline) this is now the correct trendline - keep doing this until you get taken out. Doing this ensures that you do not give back too much profit. There I go rambling again http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Good morning I trade only with RSI and nothing else. I like to ask if Anyone knows a site that can give Us a currency screening like is done for shares Screening all the currencies for RSI 5 minutes (or 10m 30m 1h day and so on) oversold or overbought. Or maybe You can make a list of the majors. So a trader can know instantly which one to trade without losing too much time looking at each one of them At the moment I only trade EURO/USD but only when it is overbought plus 70 or oversold minus 30 I believe One can screen also with other indicators. Thank You and have a good day trading

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Thank you for the kind post Peter. I wish we can see your charts one day. Try printing to PDF and post. BTW, you never ramble. Your posts are always very insightful. Please keep posting new ideas, discoveries. Kareem

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Note how the same support trendline is becoming resistance now. Got a quick scalp on the bounce. It was good for 25 pips. Kareem

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hi Kareem, Here's something that may be of interest? check it out. RSI Pivots: We have a trend when we have a series of higher pivot highs and higher pivot lows and that trend is in place as long as this condition continues A trend (we can have trends within trends) can only change when this condition changes i.e . Looking at your post#554 We have a series of higher hi and higher lo pivots since we had the RSI draw a 2nd lower pivotallowing us to draw our initial trend line as you have shown After this second pivot low - price accelerates and gives another higher low - that cannot see the 1st pivot low of the existing trendline ---------- so we draw another trendline from the new pivot lo to the preceding pivot lo - this is now the trend line for the current RSI action A breach of that trendline tells us that we may have a change in trend (the angle at which the RSI trace breaks the trendline may be of help?) As I mentioned earlier a trend cannot change unless the sequence of higher high/higher lo pivots is broken In our example, this occurs when the low preceding the highest high is taken out (inferring that a lower lo is in the process of being formed) and this confirms the break of the new trendline. We would have got this signal during the formation of the large red "outside bar" (2nd bar in from the vertical time line) There is now a good chance (nothing is certain) that the trend will reverse - it may go sideways, the one thing of which we can be sure of is that the odds are that the previous move is over. Again easy in hindsight, but try it out - it may work for you Take care - its the exits that count Peter http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi, Just to round of the previous post -- Trading should be easy, we should not have to search for our signals - they should be obvious Using the RSI helps take much of the mystery out of price action Some of the advantages of using the RSI are: It offers set support/resistance zones (see earlier posts)- no need to study price charts and make these decisions. Offers timely signals comparable to that of pure price action (this does not mean that we neglect learning how to read price action) Very good at picking out divergence with price (great when used in tandem with the CCI(10) - what one may miss, the other picks up Can be used for line studies. e.g. our trendlines help define trends, or to define patterns. Etc, etc Knowing what the various RSI S/R levels represent, we know the possibilities when we have a trendline breach occur at these levels. Basically trends start from one of two conditions- Consolidation (congestion), or from a trend reversal (or large retracement/rally) We know the RSI S/R levels where these occur ssoooooooooo theoretically THESE ARE THE TRADES WITH THE GREATEST POTENTIAL!! Before taking a signal - we should look for some form of confirmation i.e. from trend structure (pivot hi/lo sequence), divergence (CCI is very sensitive to this), a price reversal bar etc etc We construct our trendlines from the RSI pivots as soon as we have 2 lower pivot highs (downtrend), or 2 higher pivot lows (uptrend) As with everything concerning TA, some are better than others In constructing our trendlines, only use pivots that form a well defined reversal (V or U) Discard a pivot whose last "leg" tends to run parallel to the "trendline" that could be drawn by using it A pivot whose last "leg" crosses the trendline is obviously discarded even though it may conform to the higher hi, higher low or lower high, lower low requirements for an uptrend or downtrend I think after checking this out against your charts, you will be able to define your potentially best trades Just take the obvious Check your charts and make your own rules to suit your requirements. The above is something to expand upon. If you have never seen something before then you will not recognise it - I.E. you will not see it The above is the basic bones of a winning system - make it your own - good luck - sorry good TRADING Peter http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif PS I use RSI(9) and trade the daily timeframe.

Hi Ruffyn, You are welcome. Sorry I could not help. Kareem

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi Peter, Again thanks for the post. One thing you did mention is the use of the 9 period RSI. So I started thinking maybe I should use a different RSI setting. I put two 1H charts of the EURUSD, one with 21 RSI and the other 8. I use the 1H since I could not get MT4 to give me 2H, which I tend to use more now. Now please note I am going for longer term trades, 100 pip target 50 stop. So here are the pictures. The 8 RSI would have me short already, while the 21 said wait too early to enter. I will follow up in a couple of hours. My guess is that the 21 was, and still is, the right one to use. We will see. Kareem

--- 帖子 #565 ---
It seems as the 21 RSI does hold better. Of course this is not scientific, but good enough for me. Kareem

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Took the bounce of the RSI (21) trendline. Worked out for a 26 pip profit. Kareem

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I am waiting on this line break. Looks as it may be a promising short trade when it breaks.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi K. Got your pm the other day . thanks for that . glad to hear you and yours are doing ok. you do love the 21 rsi don't you. i have stuck with the 14 so somewhere between you and peter with his 8. i have been trading only cable for some time now with just 14 rsi and 30 simple ma and 14 ema applied to the rsi. Check out the bounces from the ma's. taken in tandem with pin bars and rsi 30,50,70 breaks the results have been great. ( I also look at the 40/60 and 60/80 range as peter recco'd a while ago). When these trigger and a line holds or breaks with a tight stop loss opportunity then bingo. As for your reply with the 8 or 21 question when the 8 would have signalled an entry you would still need to wait for the previous price high to break. The rsi 8 said enter but the price just tapped res turned support. I also use the 9ema on price still to guide me. Nice to see you trading instead of working. Andy

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Nice to see here again Andy. Great Post. I will check out your set up and ask some questions.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi Kareem/Andy As mentioned early on, I do not trade FOREX, I trade stocks (ASX) I post here because of the friendly helpful environment. I follow quite a few interesting threads on the forum, always looking for ways to improve my trading, and there's no better place than here The RSI is my favourite indicator and I know it works through any market condition!!!!!!! RSI time period (9,12, 21, whatever) Perhaps I should not have mentioned the time periods that I use, I did so without thinking (bit selfish) However it's the application that counts I've noticed that its not uncommon here to trade just the one pair and I can appreciate why, as like stocks, each has its own inherent characteristics - so it would be a reasonable assumption, that it is probably in our own best interest to calibrate our RSI for optimum performance for the pair being traded and its current condition? (trending or range trading) Using a longer time period will give les trades and in the process remove some of the noise from your signal, and vice versa for reducing the time period - guess you just have to experiment to find what works for you. I trade a whole basket of stocks using the 9 period and have found that it works very well for me (I also use other filters) My trades are always low risk, so it is not uncommon to be stopped out early, this is not a concern, just part of the art of trading I always have a re-entry plan - no problem In the current environment I only stay with a trade if it is moving in my expected direction, and as soon as I enter, I start looking for signs of weakness and an opportunity to exit. When the overall market is trending, I'm happy to go for the home run based on the RSI passing up thro 60 and staying with it until it falls below 40 - a much more relaxing way to trade However this may change following my recent experimenting with RSI pivots Pivots and their derivative trendlines are something special If you study pivots and their trendlines you will see that they show the short term trend and how they combine to form longer term trends Look at any chart and these short and longer term trends are there You can do a form of multi timeframe analysis from the one chart!. I've been looking at charts for years but never really noticed the trends within trends on every chart - so obvious now since spending some time looking at pivots/trendlines Who said you can't teach old dogs new tricks? The RSI is basically a magnified version of a pairs line type chart - but offers the tradeable events where this is not the case (divergencies) Well its back to the drawing board and pivots and trendlines (beats lying by the pool getting sunstoke) Such is life http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif Take care Peter

Good point about the different pairs/different stocks. I have been trading mostly EURUSD for so long that I did not think much about other pairs. How are you doing your research? What software do you use? Everything I have been doing so far have been visual. You maybe right the 9 is better than 21! Would be nice if I can quantify my RSI set up one day. Again thanks for all the feedback. Please do keep posting. Kareem

Hi Rebel, Nice to see you back. I only take the RSI trendline break, as soon as it breaks. The idea behide this set-up is that the RSI is (maybe) a leading indicator ( if there such thing). I took the same exact trade last night. I sold at 1.1533, results (below) stopped BE. Thanks

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi Peter, I have two charts on at all times. One is for the EURUSD and the other is for SP500 (US index). Along with the RSI I have another indicator that shows cycle tops and bottoms for both markets. At the time of the exit I did get major top signal for the SP500 with an exhaustion volume bar. As you know the SP500 has been following the EURUSD almost tick for tick. Also it seems as lately many of my exits have been gut feel. Sometimes I am having a good day, with a couple of nice wins and would keep the winning streak. So I would quickly move to Break Even (BE) or take whatever the market has given me at that time. Of course sometimes, I take stupid exits as well, Ones that make no sense and at the worst possible time! I would like to ask you about your stock trading as I am day trading stocks as well with a prop firm. I am barely breaking even , and found it to behave much different from FX. Can I PM you. It maybe better to keep stock discussion on its own. Thanks

Hi Kareem , Peter !!! I'm glad you are back. I just want to salute you. A little contribute : eurgbp buy two lots at the break of bearish rsi trendline + macd . close one lot and put the stop of second lot at break even. Thanks

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Glad to see you back as well. Great trade. Hope to see more of these posts soon. Kareem

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I am setting up for this one. Very nice Risk/Reward (RR). Kareem

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Look how nice rsi break trendline and retest it : short two lots at the low of yestarday candle. Thnks

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi gsfx, I do use the line re-test for quick 20 pip scalps. They seem to work well. Thanks for the post. Kareem

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Actualy I use s/r or stoch (10,3,3) overbought/oversell , or divergence to close one lot, and let the other lot run ,with sl at break even. Thanks

--- 帖子 #588 ---
If like to hold over the weekend. Short EURUSD looks promising. Kareem

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hi Kareem, was taking a hard look at that this evening myself, I decided to wait untill 61 fib level has been breached.. Rebel

--- 帖子 #590 ---
maybe i have to wait at this point,how to predict next direction?

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi Kareem, I have just checked out your RSI (21) on my stocks - ALL my RSI S/R levels, which are the basis of my trading do not work, so most of what I have previously posted will be meaningless Conclusion: Stocks and FX are two entirely different animals Sorry for wasting your time Trade well Peter http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I actually went ahead and took the trade, short EURUSD. It seems as a low risk trade. Also I feel as many will run to the USD now. I usually don't trade over the weekend, but this one felt good. I guess we will know Sunday night! Kareem

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I have your levels on and will watch them on my end. But as you know a chart is a chart and trader will be traders..greedy and fearfull in stocks, grains or Forex. So I disgree with you, they work and work well. Your posts are very helpful, and I thank you for them. I hope you stay a part of this thread. Good trading. Kareem

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi Kareem ! You have remaind at the 1 hr chart ? You look at the bigger timeframe for your trade decision ? Usually I don't trade eurusd , but look at the yellow trendline how price respect it ,and rsi the 50 level . Thanks , hope you understand "my" english

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I am still trying to decide between 1 and 2H charts. I do still look at the daily and 4H, but not for entries and Exists. I cannot get a 2H chart on MT4. I did use the FXCM 2H charting/trading account, but could not easily get the pictures posted. So, for now I am with MT4 (IBFX) using the 1H charts. I don't think I will go back to the smaller time frames, such as 5M. I found that I get too many false set ups and tend to over trade. As for my EURUSD short. I also liked the fundamentals behind that trade. I believe the US markets are due for a small drop (correction) and a strong dollar will help make that happen. I was just waiting for a set up Friday. By the Way your english is great. Kareem

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Me too I've pass from the 15 min at daily , still having another job,at least until my micro account grow a little If you need a 2hour chart in mt4 ,give a look at this thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...419#post136419

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hi Kareem, You can get any time period for MT4, all you need is the Period Converter. If you do a google search you will find it and it is free. dave

Thanks Dave and gsfx. I did find one. Kareem

eurjpy setup... possible downside movement... only monday can tell the setup is correct or not... Edit: actually every pair work with RSI divergence... My time frames, 30 minute and 4 hour...

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi Sreeprakash, Interesting set up. Thanks for the post. Kareem

--- 帖子 #601 ---
the RSI shows that the e/u will be down

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Thank you kareem bhai.. The trendlines in the chart is done by an indicator, attached herewith. The trendlines in RSI is manually drawn... I use RSI 14, but after reading this thread, I also attached a 21 RSI and I tryto draw same line on both RSI's.... I also try to match the RSI trendline with chart trendlines... I also used CCI, but I feel RSI is good... Indicator note: disable drawing semafor and your chart will be neat..

--- 帖子 #603 ---
GBPUSD It did not breaked 6593 level and went down.. At that time I was buying with another setup I felt is good, and I closed with 10 pips profit... Then I got disconnection and when internet came back I can see this setup.. I sold on 6500, and now running on loss... Possible targets see trendlines, 6400 (violet line) and 6300 (red line).. Take care....

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I got out... closed on entry.. It came down 42 pips from my target and I was hoping for 6400.. But gbp is today little volatile because of some banks buying gbpusd and selling eurgbp.. also dubai news affecting... It just hit my entry and again down, but I am not again trading on the above setup... Will post new setup sooner..

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Thanks for the file and your posts. I will try it later tonight. Kareem

--- 帖子 #606 ---
We broke the short term trend line, but the long term is still in solid,

I am short already. That is a scalp short I took based on a different set up.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
the e/u is strong

--- 帖子 #609 ---
It is broken.

Not as good as your entry Kareem, but I took this on my futures account march contract..

Sold the break, but covered too early!

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Does anyone here know how to right a simple expert advisor program? my parameters are simple. When RSI(5) hits level of 20 I want to put in a buy order for 1 lot and an alarm go off. I want it to sell the lot when 10 pips are reached. If the price drops below 20 pips from where the buy was at I want to have the program sell the lot. The question I would have, is if multiple candlesticks closed below the RSI (5) 20 level consectively would the program buy a lot on each candle (I definitely would not want that to happen)? I would [COLOR=blue !important] [COLOR=blue !important] guess [/color][/color] a line could be put in the program that only 1 lot buy could be done and until that lot sold another lot could not be purchased. Any help appreciated.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
The thread is still kicking, wow! Hopefully I will be able to post my analysis from monday... Currently I am re-reading the thread... Getting new insights actually... Thanks for all who contri-buted/buting on this thread...

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Oh, just seen I did not given update of this trade... It beautifully went down of 6400, then returned... it was 100 pips trade.. I got out on 40 pips something for some reason... See the attached picture where price touched and played... (see the green signs)...

--- 帖子 #615 ---
may be e/u will be up soon,but it is weak.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Sorry Livetotrade. I am not a programer. I hope someone else can answer this for you. Kareem

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Nice trade sreeprakash. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #618 ---
We are a bit over sold for now. My guess is we will hit the line and continue going down Kareem

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Thank you kareem bro... Attached a chart I just posted on GBP thread... (wrong thread actually) http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...stcount=186104 ........................ Here is my analysis... There is a possibility it can touch the bottom line on 4770.. See the RSI 40 value... If RSI 40 and bottom line 4770 cant bring EU back, then next stop will be 4550 and RSI 20... But personally, I dont think EU can go more down from current position or from 4770... ............................... Sorry for quoting from another thread... Now I have something to ask with kareem bro... 1. I was reading from start of the thread today and around page 30-32 something I read kareem bro said that he is using 4 hour trades because he dont have time... You also said you using big stop loss... I want to know what was the stop losses you used? 2. What is your entry method? I read on a old post that kareem bro using opening of the candle outside.. That means, first RSI trendline will broke, then you wait for current candle to close, then you watch where next candle opens... So if we use trendlines on chart, the candle must be open above for long and below for short??? 3. Now if the above is right where is stop loss we place? Or what about the stop loss actually we use? Previous candle high/low??? Or just simply use 20 pips according to 5 minute chart?? I hope you will answer these questions asap... Plz consider these as a newbie questions... Thanks again...

New EJ setup... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=417

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Both EJ and EU fullfilled their destiny... I got 98 pips on EJ, stop loss was 10 pips... Closed on 133.01... Not traded EU... It was only an analysis or idea... See the link above to see the chart of EJ...

--- 帖子 #622 ---
GBPUSD Short 1.6355, SL 1.6370, No Target actually... Maybe 100 pips... Take care...

--- 帖子 #623 ---
SL on entry, free run now...

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Closed on 6330.. It was a good trade, went down to 6315, did not expected it will return.. Realized after the re-break of weekly support and closed the trade...

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Great trading, keep the post coming..

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi sreeprakash, please read answers below. By the way nice trading. 1. I am currently working with the 1H chart. Seems to work well for me. I still like the 4H charts, but trade smaller position and bigger stops when trading it. My stop loss is somewhere between 60-100 pips. I just look at price levels when placing stops 2. I enter as soon as I see the price break. My RSI is set on close. 3. I no longer use the 5M TF. I still see it working most of the time but I have day time work and just started to trade stocks as well. Just 1-4H TF and again stop at the next price S/R. I set firm rules to entry, but very subjective about my exits. As someone said once. Entries are science, Exits are art! Again thank you for posting.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Thanks very much kareem bro. It cleared my doubts... Also thanks to rebel.... Kareem bro, actually I also using 4 hour, but the thing is I have to use big stop loss... PA sometimes go to half of the price and returns or dont go to my favour first.. But the breakout in 4 hour is done... What I can see, PA completes target in 1-3 days perfectly... Currently I am using 5 minute for entry in the 4 hour timeframe... In 5 minute, we can see when price is going to return... The trendline indicator shows trendlines in both timeframe, so that if one trendline break/reverse I check the 4 hour RSI and trendlines, then I enter... Main chart trendline break/reverse, RSI trendline break/reverse, I enter... Working good... Thanks again kareem bro and rebel.... Edit: If we use 5 minute trendline/RSI break/reverse for entry, we only need little stop loss.... The above EJ I traded with 10-15 pips sl for 98 pips target...

--- 帖子 #628 ---
GBPUSD Sold on 6462 sl 6475.. 4 hour chart, RSI is reversing, see the sign... 5 minute chart, see the sign in chart and RSI.. Trendline break to above rejected in Price.. RSI breaked for down... On 5 minute we can see RSI reversing on the channel... So far going good...

--- 帖子 #629 ---
So far it went down to 6428 from 6462, 34 pips.. But I have to blame my internet provider... Gladly I given trailing stop and it get activated on 6460, so I am letting the trade to run...

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Closed +8 pips...

--- 帖子 #631 ---
GBPUSD The 5 minute chart showing gbp is playing in a narrow range... Also the 21 LWMA telling the breakout is not good.. Wait for RSI and MA combined breakout... 4 Hour telling that breakout for uptrend... But after checking 5 minute, PA tells us wait sometime...

--- 帖子 #632 ---
wanna insert lwma together with rsi. i cant do it

--- 帖子 #633 ---
GBPUSD Update... In the above post I was hoping for an uptrend.. But soon I realized it is probably a downside movement... So I given a short on 6447, sl on 6475. It went straight up, to 6460, but sl not hit... According to the trendlines, it reversed and breaked daily pivot on 6429... My internet connection was playing bigtime, the pair reached 6379, but I was only able to close on 6398.. Got 49 pips... better than nothing... Pic attached, see the signs of entry...... mamulid, from the Indicators section, drag the Moving Average to RSI window... Then in the parameters of MA box, select 21 period, MA Method : Linear Weighted, then Apply to: Previous Indicators Data.... then click OK.. do it for 1-3 times and you can understand...

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hey guys tokk this one this morning .. came out with only 25 pips, should have held on for the kiss off the top trend line..

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Nice one Rebel...

--- 帖子 #636 ---
yes a nice trade. Notice stoch had a divergence as well. Kareem

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I like you idea of watching both the short and long term charts for the break. Thanks for the post. Kareem

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Just ont brave enough too take this short.. Rsi bouncing off 0 level..

--- 帖子 #639 ---
This one is now running... Entry 6290, SL moved to entry now.. TP set according to daily chart 6125, but dont know it go there... Edit: See RSI reversed, MA not crossed at that time, Now MA is going to cross or will reverse there... Thanks karim bro, currently I am first checking higher timeframe and use lower timeframe to enter the trade..

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Five mins later and im kicking myself..

--- 帖子 #641 ---
I closed... TP'd 6223.. 67 pips... Reason: 5 Minute RSI oversold, EurUSD Morning start pattern on 5 minute, MA touch RSI on 4 hour chart.. see attached chart... The pair will do some correction and go down more I think, but taking profit is good...

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Quick 20 pips.. 6201-6221 5 minute...

--- 帖子 #643 ---
The above said 67 pips trade stop loss was 16 pips, entry 6290, sl 6306. The beauty of checking 5 minutes gives us small stop loss... I check 4 hour first, then I try to find it is a top or bottom of a range... The trendlines helps to find it.. and checks RSI, then switch to 5 minute, and check its trendlines and RSI.... If successfully implemented, 5 minute gives us tight stop loss and good target... Edit: I also check 1 minute.. on 5 minute the trendlines are little slow to form, but in 1 minute the trendlines form fast... If I cant understand the trendlines in 5 minute chart, or there is no trendlines to the desired target area, I check 1 minute...

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Trendline helped.... I was thinking to enter the shown price on EJ... But there was a chart trendline and price touch and reversed there... RSI was breaked actually... See sign and price... Now another candle opened and it is coming down to trendline, but I am not entering now.. Attached trendline indicator I am using... Take care..

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Thank you sreeprakash. I was about to ask you for it. I will play with it some. I wonder if I can add to the RSI instead of the price chart? Nice trading. Kareem

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Good idea, did not thought about that... I just tried bro, but it is not adding.... If you found anyway plz tell us here..... Thanks...

--- 帖子 #647 ---
This one is now freely running.. SL moved to entry.. 129.26..

--- 帖子 #648 ---
SL Hit.. See trendlines... 1 minute chart...

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Another one, GBPUSD... 4 hour telling us, its a uptrend... But 5 minute broken for downside.. While checking S&amp;R levels, if price stays below 6284-72 area, its a downside movement.. Also fibo 6284, 23.6% broken... Entry 6291, SL to entry now.. no target... Free Run...

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Update for previous trade: closed on entry.. It was actually 30 pips profit, but I was expecting more, and got out on entry.. lol.. New setup: Entry 6336, sl 6350, now moved to entry.. free run..

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Watching EJ now... Nice setup I think...

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hi Sreeprakash, Did you take the trade? Kareem

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Yes kareem bro, sl 25 pips hit.. The pair down some more pips, then came back... lesson of this trade, always play with S &amp; R levels... Yesterday (friday) I played with S &amp; R levels and got some good profits... 1. gbpusd short, it failed to go over 6342 R level, I sold 6336 and closed on 6294.. It was down near to 6278 something, but I was only able to close at 6294... I am talking about the movement hours before the US news.... And I did not given trade on the news time, its risky... 2. eurjpy short, same time I have seen eurjpy failed to get over 131.09 R2 level, given sell on 131.00, closed on 130.75.. it was more down, but my internet connection played big time.. 3. eurjpy long, it failed to get down R1 130.53, seeing this, i given buy on 130.59 and closed on 130.84... the pair was actually went to 131.58 if you check the charts... lol... All these trades are based on RSI. The thing is, do not enter on trades in the middle of S &amp; R points.... Just watch the price movements and prepare our RSI lines to get the trade.. Once the price fails or succeed to accomplish a certain S or R level, give trade with small stop loss... usually 20-25 pips... Edit: I am using mafia-ibfx indicators for finding S &amp; R levels... It works perfect in ibfx demo, the owner says use in ibfx demo.. So download ibfx demo mt4 and use this... http://minibahn.blogspot.com/2009/10...ahn-mafia.html

Here is a site more detailing about RSI setups... http://www.thepatternsite.com/rsisetup.html There is a zip file containing word file, download it and read it... Also the site is a gold mine.. there are several things more to checkout...

--- 帖子 #655 ---
hi kareem In the first example chart you show on this thread , you point out that the breakout happened on the candle that rsi shows to be a breakout point , but really the breakout happened on the previous candle , you have to look at your first chart and see that price broke resistance on one candle BEFORE rsi shows breakout .

--- 帖子 #656 ---
at your second chart , price breaks support very connvincingly and immediatly , you dont even need any indicator to see that .

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hello, Anybody knows where can I get a free pencil tool to write on MT4? Thanks

--- 帖子 #658 ---
do you think that rsi is any better than usual support and resistance indis? is it better than CCI? From my experience i find that rsi is not the fastest and most usefull indicator , at least for entry , i might be somewhat usefull to indicate exit points .

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hi czango, True many times a simple trend line on the price can just as good and even faster.; But not always. I have also found the RSI to give less "false" break outs. As for other indicator, I agree that the CCI or any other momentum indicator could do the same job. I just happen to love the RSI the most. It was my first "kiss" in trading and I am hooked. Thanks for the post. Please feel free to post charts for visual examples. Kareem

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Sorry don't know, but I bet google can help. Kareem

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi czango, we cant use RSI alone for trades... I am using RSI, trendlines, pivot points combined... I have also tried CCI before, RSI is better... Use actionforex.com pivot points (daily) and use with RSI... http://www.actionforex.com/technical.../pivot-points/ Important thing is, decide the trade direction near pivot points, not in the middle of pivot points.... As for friday pivot points, see some here.... GBP/USD 1.6080 1.6147 1.6212 1.6279 1.6344 1.6411 1.6476 EUR/JPY 127.87 128.45 129.19 129.77 130.51 131.09 131.83 I was with these two pairs on friday, so I am posting pivot points for them. See how price played between pivot points.. Use RSI and trendlines and find the pivot points price can break/reverse... Use high timeframes like 4 hour to find main trend, then use small timeframes to enter the trade.. If we enter near to pivot points, we only need to use small stop losses...

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Where can we download the pivot indi that was used on those images... Rebel

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi Rebel, Dont know about that.. but amazingly my interbank indicators are same... See this post, below I have given the location of that files... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=653 Now the funny thing I seen is on the actionforex site, the daily pivots are almost same like this interbank indicators... So i am going to use actionforex pivots and check with my own interbank values... Compare: Actionforex Daily 1.6212 1.6279 1.6344 1.6411 1.6476 My indi: 1.6210 1.6278 1.6342 1.6410 1.6474 See the similarity.. just use actionforex i think.... Attached the mafia indicators screenshot

Guys, got another RSI indicator... Downloaded from another thread here...

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hello, boys - did you miss me ? As K and Andy know, I am now a MAX trader, but as I only want to take the first entry in a "MAX swing" (don't ask, I made that term up just now...), I have reverted to an improved version of my RSI screen for trading whilst waiting for said MAX entries. Two charts, 3 trades, 2 units per trade (I prefer 3); chart times are CET. EJ exit had too much giveback, but that's what happens when you write Christmas cards and trade at the same time... NB. 16 range is using Interactive Brokers data, so each bar is in fact 8 pips. GU +17 +0 GU +11 +1 EJ +20 +14 Not great, but a little under $700 and done for the morning &amp; probably the day.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Welcome back J.. nice trades today 700 bucks and your not happy, no pleasing some people .. any way you know better than to come on here and not share your template.. Thanks Rebel.. P.s hope you resume posting here again..

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hi, Reb, Those charts are Ninja Trader (I execute directly from the chart to Interactive Brokers)... you're welcome if you still want the template ? PS. If you would like it, 'will post later as I'm off on the school run in 5 mins...

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hello old friend. Nice to see you back and even nicer to see you trading well. Please feel free to post and share you ideas. Interesting set up I would to hear some more if you have the time. Kareem

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Hi sreeprakash, Thanks for the new indicators. What is the difference between the two. Please post any information with the indicator if you have it. Kareem

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Good to hear from you, Kareem. 'Hope the work is going well - I know you've been super-busy. My holiday project is to write up an intraday trading plan based on this chart setup (actually, I have one more modification to make, but I'm waiting for NT7, currently in beta release : many of the present Ninja indis will have to be recoded). I only started trading this on Friday : 5 trades / 5 winners, so a positive start which nevertheless means nothing unless it can be maintained with a reasonable level of consistency. I intend to post my trades, good , bad &amp; ugly . Btw, I am focusing on GU and EJ only at the mo, with a few EU futures trades in TradeStation (as you know, 10 futures trades a month = free platform).

--- 帖子 #671 ---
you mean that two i posted? its metatrader files, one indicator, one source i think.. The rapid rsi giving somewhat strange lines to normal rsi.. But I think its useful... need to check and compare with normal rsi, more... I found this about rapid rsi, http://forex.gftforex.com/public/item/134925

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Having just missed two great London Open shorts this morning, I slightly forced this GU trade... but the entry is not the major problem : I exited at the high of the retracement against me (I had NOT yet drawn the downsloping trendline on price ). So negative EUR 335 this morning &amp; unlikely to have time to trade again today (I'm going to post results in euros, as that's my account denomination... can't work out how to get a euro symbol into FF). GU 3u -16 -16 -16 I'll mark the initial entries with a vertical line ( red short / green long ) : the execution arrows can also be seen on the chart). The correct entry acccording to my new rules would have been to take the reject of the downsloping TL on RSI (encircled), ie. entry at 1.6253 instead of 1.6247. A very critical 6 pips.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
I have also noticed that Stops have to be wider lately. And it was a good entry, Kareem

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Jtrade, I hope we hav'nt brought you bad luck start posting on this thread and you have a losing day... hope you can explain more as we go along about your entry signals.. Rebel

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Hi J and K. Glad to see you back Jeremy. I took the trade short for 20 and then 20 long after divergence - see arrows. The difference being I was looking for a break of the lower rsi line compared to your rejection of the upper line. I am still taking 20 in one go with a 20 stop. Only cable and compounding after every trade. It's finally coming together for me. Just a note to all the other new faces regarding the different rsi variations, and don't take this the wrong way please. I have over 20 different rsi indis and after wasting all my time I find that the basic mt4 is good enough. It's about understanding the direction and flowing with it. Lizpet has written some good stuff about levels on here, and personally I just have 30,50 and 70 now. But please just study the naked rsi and learn what's coming next, you will arrive at your destination much quicker. I have attached a chart from today , red for short , green for long. +20 on each with a 20 stop. Am busy with work the rest of the week but will drop by in the evenings. Andy

Recently I have been thinking that we using RSI for entry, based on reverse/breakout... Now in this thread there no discussion I seen about using RSI for exit/take profit strategy. I think RSI can tell us where to exit or take profit. The attached is a 1 hour EJ chart.. I have drawn lines based on the criteria that, I did not taken current forming line to consideration. I tried to connect last two points to draw a line. Its amazing to seen RSI playing between these lines. The thing is, if we get two points connected and we drawed a line, check pivot levels according to that lines... Dont know about lower timeframes like 5 minute on this. But I think we can test it... I love to hear opinions from all of you... Thanks..

Hi everyone! Sorry to just burst in here... I was actually on the lookout for a filter for another system that I trade, trying to work out if there is a way to differentiate the 20 pip moves from the 200 pip moves... Good to see a familiar face here... G'day JTrade! I have been doing a bit of research, and cannot get past how freaky the RSI can be at times. I have read up to page 25 in the thread, and thus still have a ways to go to come up to speed, however, I have been messing around with a few things that I thought other's may enjoy. Firstly, I stick to rules regarding trade times... These are for reasons of volatility, which helps in achieving TP's... So, for me, I trade the Asian close/UK open... I also played around with the Step RSI from back a few pages (a few pages back for me, not you... lol) and have strung the settings out to 14, 10 and 20. Having a setting of 20 sometimes gets the third line off the chart, and sometimes it doesn’t. Unfortunately, when that line goes, so too does the alert function. I would love to have the alert, without the third line... Anyhows, what I have been looking at is the number of crosses of the 14 and 10 that occur during the peak trade times. I hope I am not sounding too simplistic, but when they cross it is a rare occasion that some pips do not result... Now, bearing in mind that 14 and 10 are not settings that have been optimised in any way by myself, there may be other numbers out there that work even better. I run off just the cross of the 14 and the 10. During peak times, there are fewer signals, as there is more momentum in the market. Concerning TP's though, I am not sure. Depending on how generous the market is feeling at the time, it can be a great indicator. Generally speaking, you can get 10+ out, from what I can see from visual back-testing. In alignment with my other trading plan, I would see the cross of 14/10 as a signal candle, and wait for the close. Then I would be looking to enter this high/low +2 pips. I notice that sometimes the signal can occur, then there can be a retracement. Waiting until the PA goes +2 pips in your favour should reduce drawdown and false signals. Ideally, it should be on the next candle, or else it is sometimes a false signal. Additionally, I notice that the hallmark of the candles at the cross of the 14/10 seem to be much smaller than their neighbouring counterparts. I am not up on candlestick patterns, but I would assume that this would mean something to someone. It certainly seems to be a good indication that the PA has found a good pivot. From what I can see, just trading the cross of the 14/10, in good trade times with heaps of volatility, seems to earn 10 pips plus on most occasions. If I could code up an EA, I would see if there was some long term statistical validity in that statement, but on the basis of visual backtesting, it seems mostly consistent. Certainly, if you had a 1:1 ROR, you would find yourself in front, from what I can see. Unfortunately, I couldn't code my way out of a wet paper bag... 'Hello World' is about the extent of my coding knowledge. Maybe with an EA to manage your exits, you could TP1 @ 10 and trail the rest? There is certainly enough volatility behind most RSI crosses to ensure that you DD would be minimal. If what I have said has made some sense to the thread, and may be able to be verified either via EA or visuals, then alls good. I trade six pairs, consistent with my other strategy, mostly due to the effects of correlation. They are: GU, EU, AU, GJ, EJ and AJ. Timing is from around 07H00 GMT, although some setups seem to happen an hour earlier. Today they were: GU - 34 pips peak, EU – 26 pips peak, AU – 27 pips peak, GJ – 30 pips peak, EJ – 27 pips peak and AJ – 34 pips, all just from essentially ONE signal in late Asia. Even if you only took 10 out of each... Of course, the 14/10 combo doesn't keep you out of all the bad crosses (false entries), but the +2 pips rule certainly helps. Maybe there is something else that can be used as a filter that I have not read in the thread yet... Other than timing and the 2 pip rule, I also keep away from news (although I notice that the RSI can be quite intuitive at such times - more experimentation will be needed on my behalf before I am convinced) observe pivots, the ADX, and the ATR. There may be relevance on where the cross occurs along the continuum between 0 and 100 too... Will need to investigate more. Will keep on keepin on! PPP

Thank you paidperpip, it was a great post... The 14/10 you referring to MA's?? I did not used that StepRSI thing... Please post more of your trade ideas and chart.. It will help us more... Here is the update for previous trade... Plz compare... Entry 130.37 (bad entry actually), stop loss 129.80, TP closed manually on 130.64. The difference in drawing with previous chart is, the bottom check sign I have moved little for visibility. Then I drawn green line after RSI reversed.. I found two points to connect that green line... old post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=676 New image attached

'Morning, Good to hear from you, Andy, and a nice clean chart. I think a lot about the idea of just going for +20 : there's no doubt that on the less trending days it's an excellent way to go. However, I'm trying to morph my shorter term trades into MAX-style trades, complete with scale-ins, to try to build trades on the longer moves. I've gone through periods in the past of just shooting for +8 +20 with a 2 unit entry, during which my average loss was -12 with a high win rate, but if the market then moves another 100 pips, I feel I'm a dumbo (well, I feel that quite a lot when trading anyway ). Rebel - thanks for your kind words; we'll see how it goes. sreeprakash - I think earlier in the thread Kareem posted a few charts using the RSI TL break for his exits : I agree it can be a very good tool for both holding the trades that need to be held and exiting early when appropriate. Hey, PPP, starter of one of my favourite current threads. StepRSI used to be my #1 indicator and that's an interesting parameter set you are experimenting with. But like Andy, I am now using standard RSI. Btw, my fast momentum line (the line on "DSMColor") very closely tracks a 3 period TRIX - on my TradeStation charts I have a 5 &amp; 30min TRIX, plotted as a line and histo respectively (all borrowed from Gleneagles MTF ideas, of which I am a great fan). As we all know, price-derived indicators are all lagging and I prefer to focus on as few as possible.... (10 minutes pass, as I sit staring at my screen trying to resist the train of thought that wells up from deep within my trading brain.... "Price derived indicators are all lagging, so why I am using them ! ?" ). Oh, dear, please refer back to post #508 on this thread, which started this train of thought, and now look at the chart I just made : a range bar line chart with no indicators ! It looks like RSI - and therefore pleases me - but it is simply price... I am sitting here asking myself "Could I really do this ?" It's a very liberating possibility... I'd better wait for the men in white coats to come and get me... (to be continued) Edit (after 3 hours of fiddling about with charts / reviewing reams of trading notes) : I should really delete the above post, having returned to normality (although the "no indicator line chart method" remains on the back burner), but perhaps I'll leave it to ensure no-one actually follows my suggestions...

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hi Andy, Good to see you back. I think you are right one price chart one RSI and it should all you need. I see you still have the same set up. I hope to hear from again soon. Kareem

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Hi paidperpip, Interesting post. I will take a look and post some charts. My programming skills are as good as your, but maybe someone else can test this for us. Please feel free to add charts if and when you can. Thanks for the post. Kareem

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hi sreeprakash, The RSI set up was initially designed to be an exit only. The original author of this set up (see post 1) used other set ups for entries and the RSI trend line to know when the move is done. But when I studied the entry possibility, I noticed that it can give good trades. And you are right; back to the RSI. Kareem

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi J, I have thought about the lagging argument many times and but I still think that indicators are useful. First they do take the noise out of the price and there is lots of noise in Forex. Second, professional trades do use them, but here is the key; they use only one (this was concluded by reading and peeking on the screens of some of these trades). Yes most professional traders have 17 screens but with price and one indicator. Again thanks for the posts, and hope to see them again soon. Kareem

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Thank you guys jtrade and kareem... kareem, yes, sorry you said that exit strategy thing in first page, lol i forgot... Also, plz guys, plz test the 200 LWMA thingy on RSI when you get time... Its somewhat promising... Price always comeback to that line, break or reverse...

--- 帖子 #686 ---
hi sreeprakash The 200 lwma does have some touches which give it credibility. they probably show up more clearly in hindsight and when backtesting. I have looked at it on m5 which I trade and h4 which I notice your chart is. I have tried every value of lwma and rsi. They will all give a bump at some time or other. When you look at cable m5 today it had two lovely touches this evening , yet this afternoon ignored it in favour of the 50 line (rsi 14). Whatever suits your eye or style is the one to use but I would say that the 200 tends to look much like the flat 50 line when i lean back in the chair. Do you not think something a bit quicker would help more. I use the 30 sma and attach a chart with both on. purple 200 and red dot 30. Look back on any chart for divergence. With or without an rsi line break the next thing to look for is confirmation/proof that it was divergence. the 123 break of the sma30 occurs quite soon along with price crossing and holding 9ema on chart. Finally rsi breaking the 50 and enter or cover at b/even ready for a break further or rejection. I was at work all day but took the short after the usd news for 20. Entry on red line,- reasons- divergence(hidden under your 200lwma), break of rsi lower t/line, break of 30sma then a retest of sma and 9ema on price. entry 1.6330 short 20sl 20tp. A bit later there was another one but didn't take it but look at the div in red lines and the little test of the sma then through. This lower red line line could become a strong rsi line to watch. Any questions please ask. What do you think? Andy

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Namaste Sreeprakash, Nope, the settings I am referring to are all in the Step RSI indi... On the charts below, I have them set to 14, 18 and 20. The 20 gets the line off the chart, and the 18 seems to give few false signals for the 14. Am I just imagining this? Could it be this simple? I know the TP's are not huge, but if they are consistent, then who cares? The two charts are from my trade times last night and the night before. You will notice that one of them only got to 9pips, and if TP1 was 10 pips, and given a 1:1 RoR for TP1, then that one would have cost 10 pips. Bottom line is that the RSI is great for taking little mouthfulls. It reacts well with the market and is quick to signal 'mini pivots' inside the move, and yet can also catch the very beginnings of good long moves. With good MM and a well designed TP structure, this could be something worth taking a better look at. Still more testing needed for me to trade it live, and given that these signals can go off rather quickly, and likely on multiple pairs at the same time, it makes it hard to trade multiple pairs manually, unless you stick to just a minimum amt of pairs. And of course, one sparrow does not make a Spring... I have not had the chance to follow this idea along in real time over an extended period. However, historically, with visual back-testing, it looks like a sound proposition. PPP

Well, trading IS simple... it's just not so easy... ... but I think you've come up with a potentially very good "StepRSI Scalp" method (not waiting for Gleneagles 2010 TRIX scalp method...tsk, tsk ? hehe, only kidding). No charts from me today as MAX trading (+EUR 659) - pity I can't really post the charts, as they include StoRSI...

Yeah! Impatient little blighter that I am! lol Actually, I was initially looking for a way to differentiate between moves with vigor behind them and those that will be flat out making TP1... Funny what you find when you are looking for something else... We shall see how it progresses... PPP

Here you go sir ji..... will try some 5 mins trades to day aiming for 10 pips max... My entry was when the minor trendline broke but the market dint move down till the major trendline broke and when it did it was raining pips...i exite early....would have bagge another 30-40 pips but ahh im happy!!

I love the simplicity of the system taking price action into account...!!! something i always wanted to do.. but was also unable to achieve! any ideas for 5 mins trade guys?

Thanks paiderpip and Andy.. Sorry for being late, I was not here for sometime... I have carefully read both of your posts, and getting new insights for me... Thanks again bros... I have abandon the idea of 200 lwma.. going to test with lwma 30.. Currently my things are rapid rsi, trendlines, pivot points... Have some success, some failures... Still not getting the actual movement of price... Sometimes I get hit by sl with a small pips and I am thinking why? You guys have any idea about TP and SL using RSI?? I dont like the idea of 20 pips TP and 20 pips SL.. We have to run the trade for good amount of profit with small stop loss... In two days gbpusd moved 500+ pips up and down.. I am just thinking why we not getting this movements? How to understand the market movements more?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
The attached is a demo statement of last 2 days... 100% success and profit... I have been trying to follow the price action of gbpusd for last 2 days and nearly I am getting success.... The 3 losses you seeing is actually success trades, the price moved my favour around 50-70 pips, but I was not here to close the trades, so it came back and hit sl... Considering those, its 100% success... Chart attached is gbpusd 4 hour.. what I am trying to say is we can simply follow the price movements using rsi divergence.... using pivot points we can achieve success.... The RSI breakout is actually not working for me.... So I am going with divergence and it is working great...

--- 帖子 #698 ---
G'day Sreeprakash, I don't want to insult your intelligence, because you may very well know what I am about to say, so I hope that you are not offended. I offer the following advice in the knowledge that advice is generally free, and in the hope that you may benefit from it: Firstly, TP's and SL's need to be individual to the setup you are running... All of which will hinge on how much you qualify a trade before you enter into it. If you can weed out some of the false trades in some manner, it will reduce the number of losers you get into, and it may also reduce the amount of profit per successful trade, however, if you reduce your losers by (say) 10%, how much more sure of a winner can you be? Does that not mean that you can perhaps put more on the trade? You only need to win 10 pips a week to be successful! The rest is MM... If you had a condition such as: 'The trigger candle needs to be 2 times the length of the signal candle before I enter', how many bad trades would that keep you out of? I use the 2 pip rule: The trigger candle must be at least 2pips beyond the signal candle in order to qualify for a trade. It is amazing how many bad trades such a simple thing can keep you out of! So, if you can filter out your false entries a little, you will be doing much better. Have a look at the sizes of the candles on the big moves. Although I have a different setup to you, have a look and see if they are different to the surrounding candles. If you notice, the best setups start with a tiny little candle which might poke through a 50 line or similar. Then, the next candle is the monster that propels the trade into profit. It doesn't happen every time, but it happens enough to be observable. If a move is good, how good is it on average? If you draw up a week's worth of entries/exits, is there a common figure? Negating the 'outliers' at either end of the standard deviation curve (the extreme losses and the extreme winners), is there a figure that you can come up with that, given a moderate move in a market, you would feel confident of getting? Lets say that your average win, outside catching the beginning of big trends is 30 pips... So, set your TP1 at 30 pips, or thereabouts... Remember, you can catch a big fish on a small hook, but you can't catch a small fish on a big hook! So, now you have made it harder for a signal to qualify as trade (thus reducing your losses) and you have a statistically valid average of what you can expect to gain from an average move (should it qualify), and you are consistently picking up 30 pips for each move that makes it through your 'due diligence' checklist. But what about all those other pips? I use an EA to manage my trades for me. It is called Update Stops (2), and I will attach it to this post. Essentially, you can set it with up to four profit targets, including a trailing stop. It will also bring your stops to BE as well, which is kinda nice! In this way, if your average 'good trade' equals 30 pips, but you also want to trade a trailing stop, then you set the EA up to exit half your position at 30 pips, and the remaining 50% will trail along behind, with parameters set by you. Its not a 'sure fire' way to get everything out of a trend though. You may have a trailing stop of 25 pips, and get stopped out half way through a move by consolidation before the market moves again. And, the cost of broadening your SL may mean losing out on a lot of profit. Its something that you will have to fiddle with to fine tune it to your needs. At the end of the day, you need to be comfortable with your own risk. So, I would suggest, make it harder for a signal to turn into a trade. Work out the average profit you would obtain from an average move in the market, and set your TP1 at that mark, or a little lower. Finally, trail a stop loss behind you to see if you can pick up any extras. In the other strategy that I trade, there are four TP's... Depending on the pair being traded, TP1 = 25 pips, TP2 = 35 pips, TP3 = 50 pips and the TS is set to around 25 pips. We don't hit those targets every day, but when we do, it is sweet. I would suggest that you might like to keep it nice and simple initially... Have TP1 set at the average you could expect to get on an average trade, and then trail the rest. You can get fancy with other TP's along the way, but the important thing is to lock in early profit, and leave yourself open to the potential of making more. Leaving it at only 2 TP's also has the advantage that your risk is double, rather than quadrupled with 4TP's. Again, sorting that risk out is about making it harder to quantify a trade signal into an actual trade. Its like a set of scales: Take losses from one side of the scales, and you actually add wins to the other side. Anyway, this was not meant to be as long as War and Peace, so I will leave you with it. All the best with the coming week. PPP

Thank you paidperpip, That was a long post full of thoughts and advice... Thanks for the indicator also. The indicator will help a lot.. lol.. thats a good thing on first tp, indicator can close the half postion and move the sl to BE... Really good.. sometimes we cant do that manually.. because price movement will be fast.... My entry method was like this; I check trendlines and RSI, if there is a breakout or divergence, I look for daily pivots.. I enter trade with sl with 15-20 pips distance from the pivot level.. Now this worked good for sometimes, but soon I realized that price breaking this pivot level, going beyond many pips of that level... I dont know how this is happening, but I want to find the solution... Now 2 days ago I noticed that price break this pivot level (daily pivot), then goes to 4 hour pivot then comes back in my favour... Consider I already stopped out, so this happened many many times... Now another thing I realized that, I am doing RSI breakout method, not divergence... In breakout, price can break or can reverse... We dont know what it will do... So in conclusion, I hope for a breakout, then check pivot point, then gives the trade, but price doing a reversal and go to opposite way... Same for reversal.. I hope for reversal, but price doing breakout... Now for the last some days, I have givenup the idea of breakout or reversal and I am doing divergence with RSI.. and its pretty good working... The divergence must be in overbought and oversold levels... also checks trendlines... sl must be below/above next pivot point.. tp on trendlines/consider next pivot points... PS: I need to read 2-4 times your post, because my understanding in english is low... means, i only get the thing after reading several times...

Hi Kareem, Firstly, make sure that the Expert Adviser on the toolbar is clicked. This should turn the into a . Secondly, ensure that under the Common tab in the EA's dialogue box, Allow Live Trading has been ticked. If the EA has a X next to it, that should fix it. If the EA itself is working fine, and you are looking for the Hard Stop, it should appear when you click Ok. It will be a dotted red line. Any other problems, let me know. PPP

Good trade K. Still in it I hope. I'm short of cable myself, 30 pips up at the moment. It's been up and down all day. I had to pop out when it hit the daily pivot or I would have added some more.

Morning kareem. Looks like you made your 70 level if your trailing stop didn't kick in first. I got out my cable for 20 as it started to climb back up. Short again now for some quick points back down to this trendline. Will be worth watching when it gets there. i think it will coincide with a touch of the 89 and 200emas. Hope everyone has a good time over xmas. Andy.

Took 20 on the way down 6006 down to 5986. It now has come to rest on the rsi t/line and the emas.If the rsi can hold below the rsi50 level it may go further. I think it will sit around here for a while now though. I think thats me done for the day. Andy

Nice trades Andy. great set ups. And yes I got my target (100). I trail at 55, which usually gives it plenty of room to move. I am flat for now, will wait for another set up.

Murray Math (MM) lines and Bolinger Bands on RSI! See chart... Attached MM indicator.... Play with colours and you can use light colours...

--- 帖子 #727 ---
This is either crazy or very clever.... . What kind of settings do you use as RSI ? A 14 RSI with 70/80 and 20 / 30 levels, and how do you incorporate the Boll. Bands ? What does that give you that placing directly on the price chart does not ? I find the idea ( see lizpet`s posts ) to work directly with S/R levels on the RSI very good, but until now the basic success IMHO still comes from seeing divergences and early breakouts before price does. But who knows ? Can you give some examples applying this, showing the advantage ? Thank you and happy trading to all...;-)

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Interesting Sreeprakash. I will add to my charts and watch. Thanks for sharing. Kareem

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Thank you marple and kareem... There is a small correction in the chart I posted above. The values shown on MM lines was incorrect, I need to change the timeframe back and forth to get correct values on lines.. its not needed for everytime, but sometimes just changing timeframe gives correct values... The top value is 6067... price dropped from there and went down to 5866, but I closed on 6000, only near 50 pips profit... then I bought on 5982 and given back the pips (lossed)... marple, RSI is default settings... RSI 21 I am now using... The 70-50-30 value is mainly I am using, I added 80-20 for visual purpose... To get bolinger on RSI, just drag bolinger from Indicators section to RSI, then in the Parameters box, just select "Previous Indicators Data"... Dont know about Bolinger on price, but I am seeing Bolinger on RSI is somewhat promising... I have attached a new chart with new MM lines, and see where RSI touched on Bolinger... The thing is, I am fascinated to RSI trading... So I am experimenting with new things on it... But we have many false trades that we need to take care... Currently I am using trendlines, MM lines, volume indicator with RSI... 2 days ago I seen a deltastock chart.. in that they have 2 RSI... 14 period RSI and 28 period RSI on same box.... I tried it but price action not matching with this setup... The MM lines is somewhat accurate with pivot levels... So my setup is, find the divergence/breakout on RSI, enter near to pivot levels and use small stop loss... find target using 4 hour timeframes... enter using small timeframes... All the best...

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi Sreeprakash. It's good to see you going through all the possibilities surrounding the rsi and its uses. I feel that the bolly band thing is risky though. Look at this chart for the same time as yours. The touch of the bands that you used for your short was taken when the rsi is still over 70. It can easily stay up there for ages. Had you waited for the line break after the retest of the 70 line in the purple box with arrow it would have given you a safer entry. The second t/line break is clear whereas the bolly bands are still squeezing. Also noteable are the sma(red dotted) bounces in the 2nd and 3rd purple boxes.

Hi Andy, thanks for taking time to analyze my setup. The trade was this; Entry 6058, SL 6075, TP manually on 6002... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=726 +Why I did taken this trade because, I used divergence, not breakout.. Divergence + RSI 70 area + Murray Math (MM) line was near on 6070 area.. so placed SL above that value... so if this setup work, I get some pips and if not work, I will loss small pips... Bolinger only used for visual purpose.. I relied on RSI and MM line... The MM lines got some problem, but in the rightside of the chart it showed correct value... Thanks again for your analysis and we need more thoughts from folks like you.... The attached is new setup based on 4 hour chart... Entry 5884, sl 5860, tp 5982... (the trendline, the sign).. probably.. And the MM line comes on 5869 saying Ultimate Support on 15 minute chart.. PS: As I said in one of my previous post, the breakout not working for me actually.. So I am using divergence on smaller timeframes, but this may come as breakout in larger timeframes..

GBPUSD, price made another low at 5855. Weekly pivot is around 5859.. I have updated the stop loss of the above trade to 5845 and still running... See chart, RSI touch bolinger middle line and reversed.. hopefully it will touch trendline again and go up... If not, my loss will be 40 pips... lets see... Before sometime, it went up to 5911 but I did not closed or updated stop loss... as a result, now running in loss...

Hi Sreeprakash. I have a few points to make/analyze and please don't be offended if they sound harsh, I do not mean to be rude. I have to point out a few things and hope you take them as they are intended with goodwill. I am sure if I went back and read some of my early posts they would reflect yours and that is why I will make these comments. I am finally starting to make some good money at this and if I can shave some time off your learning process then it will make me content. I do not know where you are with your money management and if you are live or demo but you seem to be asking yourself and others the right questions to learn all the quicker. Look at the h4 chart here. I do not see a long trade yet. We are in a massive downtrend and you are trying to pick the bottom. From an M5 chart it might be possible. That said do not move your stop. If your stop should have been at the weekly pivot then you should position size accordingly and use a wider stop from the outset. The rsi is at 30 and may stay there while price continues down. If you were good pips up against the trend they should be in your account now. Don't be greedy. I took 85 yesterday on the second trendline breaks on my earlier chart to you because I knew if that 6000 level broke it would move big. IF I went against the trend like this it would be for a max of 20. Once somebody told me if I used the word HOPE in a sentence while referring to a trade then I should close it. It could take 5 tries to reverse the down trend at the weekly pivot. Just wait for it to fail with an order below the previous low. The rsi is camped out in the lower 30/50 channel at the moment and below the massive rsi trendline. We havent't got confirmed divergence yet either. Keep your chart as clear as you can. You may find mm lines helpful but they will be gone in 2 weeks and replaced with something else. Look at the chart I have posted. From a 4hour perspective you should only go long when the 9ema(green) is pointing upwards and broken the 34 (red). I have only thrown the purple s/r lines quickly onto the chart but these are the only lines you need. I do not want you to lose money and want your stop loss to hold, but if you were determined to trade long and you put so much faith in the weekly pivot holding then you should go long at the pivot. Also don't forget how manipulated the market could be this week with holidays so anything that works now may not in the future. Most of this consisted of statements but any questions, please ask. Andy

Thanks Andy... Bro, please keep in mind that if you or anyone say opposite view/suggestions to my view/analysis, thats not offending or outrating me... Actually you are helping me to correct my view and analysis... and helping other people also... I do not think I am the smart or right, market is always.... Yesterday I got profit and loss... One experienced trader given signal gbpusd sell and I longed it.. He got 136 pips profit and I got lost earlier profit... Yes you are right about picking top and bottom.. actually i picked top yesterday and got some success.. now tried to pick bottom and maybe it will hit sl.... Bro, I will never get angry or disappoint if you guys tried to correct me and give more insights... I am not that type of guy...lol.. I value all of your opinions... Sometime before, I got lost some good amount on forex... after that I am trying to study the market and doing trades with micro account.. Thanks again Andy... Edit: SL hit on previous trade.. The max I am willing to lose in any trade is 40-50 pips only.. Previous experiences told me that wasting more pips is not good... Earlier I trade for 100-150-175 pips stop losses...

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Bought again on 5841, running good now... moved sl to entry... possible target 5881... Price reversed on RSI trendline...

--- 帖子 #736 ---
TP hit for 40 pips.. Little relief, earlier loss covered... Attached image, RSI going to touch bolinger middle line... may cross or reverse...

--- 帖子 #737 ---
gbpusd sold... Entry 5896, sl 6020, possible target 5856.. Edit: seems going good.. Entry criteria, see pic.. MM line 1/8 1.5900 Intersection of two trendlines just above... RSI showing reverse sign, but bolinger widen...

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Well done very nice trades today... keep them coming.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Thanks you bro, For sometime not seeing your analysis and things.. Please keep updating with charts and insights...

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Great discussions and charts. I have not posted any trades because I have really seen any good ones. It does feel as volume is low and traders are waiting until next week. There was one nice short (the first line), but I missed it.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Shreekapash, what TF was that ? I was seeing a classic regular Div.. I am testing different versions of RSI as mentioned in the thread. You are right, RSI also fascinates me more than any other indicator. I hope to contribute next year regularly. Thanks to kareem and our master15min trader andypips...

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi Marple, TF was 15 minutes and RSI 21... There was a typo in that post, SL was 5920.. SL hit... I normally use 40-50 pips sl.. above this is not good.. why giving away pips... Actually i am trading less for sometime.. Last month I got good loss... many losses in a row.. So decided to study more.. I have tried many things and as a result this month losses reduced... I also started to use small stop losses this month... And I am using divergence more than breakout... I bought on 5841 and closed with 40 pips.. If I stayed in that trade, I already have 200 pips... lol.. But we dont know what is coming next... After trying and doing many many things and indicators, I moved to RSI last month... Now I have win rate more than any other method or indicators... We only need to filter some bad trades...

--- 帖子 #743 ---
This is about the volume thing.. Few minutes ago gbpusd hit 6144, MM line 1/8 on 15 minute chart... Then down to 6115 and staying around there now... RSI reversed also.. I was watching the price from 6073 to 6144.. the Volume still the same, not changed... BMC sell price still showing 6074.. Now the price collecting buy volumes and sell volumes.. It will collect enough sell volume and go to 6074 first.. then it will decide what to do... Lets see.. will update later.. price now 6114.. Edit: If the BMC buy price get update to any of the current level, gbpusd go up more...

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Update: The max buy and max sell moved to current price levels, i.e, 6115 and 6116. As a result, gbpusd should go up.. RSI on 15 minute also reversed... The low was 6108..

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Price jumped from 6113 to 6137, then down to 6125 area, then now up again... Now on 6136.. I am trying to understand the volume analysis with RSI.. If both can combine, there will be no other things powerful like this...

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Price hit 6144 again and max sell moved to 6134.. It was 30 pips profit from 6115-6144.. Now dont know what price going to do.. my experience is very little on this volume thing...

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Price again upto 6151 and RSI showing little reverse.. Also max sell volume accumulated on 6134 have no change... So I given a sell on 6151.. sl 6180.. above 2/8 MM line...No TP... Lets see whats going to happen... Update: SL hit beautifully... -29 pips.. .............

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Seems sell volume absorbing buy volumes.. RSI 15 minute and 4 hour showing possible reversal.. I have given short on 6193, sl 6240, tp open.. probably 6134, then 5982...

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Seems as most break are happening in the London session ( in my sleep). So again no trades for me. Sreeprakash, thanks for your posts again. Kareem

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Thank you kareem bro.. In the previous trade, SL missed for 1 pips and now back and running in profit.. lets see how much it goes... Markets are going to close... HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!

--- 帖子 #751 ---
If break 6140, then there is a possibility that it can go to 5982 areas...

--- 帖子 #752 ---
hi kareem40 i met a situation on Thursday,below is the picture. i drew a line,and wait the RSI indicator to break the dot "1", i think it is a signal for buy,but it is a false signal,the price went down soon. how to deal with the situation?how to check whether it is a right break or not? sorry for my bad english. yourspace

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Hi Yourspace. This does happen for many reasons. The first, and most important, is that "the markets can and do anything at any time." So set you set loss and consider it cost of doing business. But in order to minimize this from happening I did the following. If the RSI break it should do it hard and fast, so do move your stop to break even when you are plus 20. If you are stopped at BE then the move was not a good one, and you might see a bounce off the line ( so you can reverse your trade). Also I have noticed that I get less of these using higher time frames. Currently I am set on the 1H charts. To be honest, I truly starting to believe that Forex need to be traded at even higher time frames!! Last note on the break, do not wait for candle to close, you can miss many good trades this way. If you are trading the 1H charts, go in as soon as it breaks, especially if it is a long trend line. Happy new year to all. It has been great having you all as my trading friends in 2009 and hope to continue this friendship in 2010. Kareem

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Best wishes to you also Kareem, thanks for all your input.. Danny.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
yourspace, the trend reversed there... RSI above 70 considered as overbought normally, but price can go up more... Also stoch overbought there...Possible reversal sign... You have to check pivot levels there.. also drawing trendlines are the key... More practice needed... Actually I am not using break.. i am using divergences now... sometimes the price will break, then reverse and gives loss... I am feeling safe on divergence.. because when a trendchange happens, a divergence occurs.. and I can enter at that reversal point normally... In breakout, we enter after good pips leaving behind.. and we dont know if the breakout is valid or it get reverse... Find the higher timeframe trend, then look for entry in smaller timeframe.. then ride with higher timeframe... For example, yesterday gbp reversed on 6236, fell down to 6210, tested 6236 again, there was a MM line there, I have my SL above that line, not touch, then price again fell to 6125.. it was a nice ride... The pic attached is my entry point yesterday.. My entry got bad, on 6093, I have placed sl on 6140, it missed 2 pips away I think... Then fell down 110 pips something.... See the RSI line I drawn.. there was a reversal there, I entered, but RSI changed direction and trendline broken and hit RSI 80, then fell down.. As you can understand from this, there is no method is 100% success.. Use good stop loss, use pivot points, and stay with patience... If one trade got fail, check things, analysis again, think how it got loss.. Then trade again...

Thank you msmarple, Kareem

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I know this post is from last year , but I think it perfectly describes the simplicity and benefit of using trendlines with RSI (very clear chart posted) : great stuff, Andy. and Happy New Year to everyone on this great thread .

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Thankyou J. That was a nice setup to show the use of the lines and got me some nice pips to pay santas bill. I am sure in time that sreeprakash will get the trend line thing. In addition to divergence it really works. The journey through all rsi indis(bolly etc) is not wasted though as it teaches you all you need to know ready for a naked rsi at the end of your search. A bit like dressing up the charts and then stripping them clean again. How's the Max trading going? And a Happy New Year to yourself, Kareem and everyone else on here. Andy

Kareem, Thanks for posting this RSI strategy. Have you tested on bigger TF? How about other pairs?

--- 帖子 #764 ---
bunton, thanks for posting this ebook. I love Hayden's illustration.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
hi unclek, I works better on higher time frames ( 4H and 1H are the ones I am using now). And it does work on all time frames, I stay with the EURUSD becasue I like it. Welcome and thanks for the post, Kareem

--- 帖子 #766 ---
May get a double top soon, then a brake of the rsi trend line would be enough reason for me to take the short..

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I missed the long overnight. waiting for the short on the break next. Kareem

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Hi Rebelheart, Please note I am using the 21 RSI, so my set up might take longer. Kareem

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Volume + RSI GBPUSD The Max sell was 6211 for sometime and it changed to 6157 now.. RSI reversed for a long trade and crossed 50.. I entered on 6159 and SL on 6140 because 6140 is the last 15 minute candle low. tp 6210 for now, because the max buy is on 6218. One thing is sure, this volume thing give me mad or give me some insights about price movement... Still trying to understand about volume trading.. The thing is, experts saying we cant use RSI or fibo alone, we need confirmations.. confirmations from non-correlated indicators... So I am trying many type of things with RSI... PS: I have got a 66 pips loss a little time ago on another trade..

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Update: Price up to 6170 then dropped to 6154 and max sell changed to 6164. Then in the current price level, large buy volume entered and price pushed to 6164. Now sitting on 6170..

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I have got 2 opportunities to close the trade with 30 pips profit.. price went 2 times around 6190 area.. but was believing that it hit my tp on 6210 and because of news, price dropped.. now sitting on 6137 area... Another thing I done before news is, I have updated my sl from 6140 to 6100.. and now running in loss...

--- 帖子 #772 ---
closed with -59 pips loss... Better luck tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #773 ---
best of luck tomorrow and thanks for sharing your trades with us. Kareem

Late in the day, but a break is a break. I am in short. Kareem

--- 帖子 #775 ---
In as well lets hope we see good retrace tomorrow..

--- 帖子 #776 ---
now hte price of E/U breaks the dot "1",but i don't think it is a valid break.maybe we can draw line "3",in the price falls down the line "3",i will sell

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I got stopped at -50 pips

--- 帖子 #778 ---
I like to start my trend lines from the most recent pivot. Must be careful to not to change how you draw the lines. You can always draw a line to justify your trade. It should be the other way around. Kareem

--- 帖子 #779 ---
I stuck with it for a break even..

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hi Yourspace. Just a quick look at your chart and some comments if they help. Your line 3(orange on the chart) is drawn under points on the rsi that are not formed by sharp price reversals. The decision as to where to draw them from is hard but can be made easy. Look for a sharp and definite price reversal on the candles - a rejection of price. If this is coupled with a bounce on the rsi from major 30 or 70 levels creating a peak or v on the rsi then better still. Look how the orange line was broken and you expected a sell but the price consolidated and rose instead. Now look at the rising trend line in green. See how its drawn under two major price reversals and when broken holds firm for a good short. Your orange line is not drawn under a second strong low price action set up. There was also the small black rsi t/line which was broken upwards for good pips after the green one was drawn. Although the green one was broken down later in the day notice how it still gave support to the upmove of todays high, then an entry for the short. I personally use this all the way down to the m1 for taking smaller targets. I see you post h1 charts , have you tried looking for live setups on m1? It can help the eye spot these quicker for practice. It doesn't mean you have to trade them. Hope this helps. Andy Hi Kareem. I notice you too took the short. Sorry it didn't turn out for you. I have decided not to trade live this week because work is crazy. I have upped my stake now and doing ok, but I don't want to work all week to give it back. I also don't want to go backwards and trade smaller as I feel this would have a negative effect. Saying that I started with 20 points sunday night and 5 trades for 57 points no losses last night on m1 demo. Anyway I was going to say that although my comments above to Yourspace relate to your trade as well there is one major thing i noticed which only shows itself now and then and never gets mentioned by anyone. How squeezed the screen/candles are can make a huge difference on ones perception of a slope/low/high etc. Compare my rsi in my chart to your own and suddenly the slope of the rsi and significance of the lows it was drawn under become relevant. Although the 14 and 21 rsi are different it is marginal. The lows on my orange line are to small and too steep especially when compared to the green line. We had also entered the 60/80 zone and it refused to leave there on the first try. Maybe the answer would be to ensure there are a minimum number of candles on the chart to ensure enough compression. It has got me thinking to go back over some of my losing trades and check this out. Andy

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Great post Andy. Thank you. I will look into your point. I think I will start to have the same number of candles for every post. I think this will help me and anyone who is reading the post. I am very glad to hear about your new success in trading. And you are right I would have better off not taking the trade. Do be careful of demo trading, it also creats bad habits. I never demo trade. I think demo trading is useful to learn a new platform. Take care, Kareem

gbpusd, sold at 6172, sl 6206, tp looking for 6000.. Reason, the value 6172 playing with good sell volume and RSI going to break on 15 minute, also reversed on 4 hour chart... Will update later...

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Watching EU for a break, changed back to RSI 21, 14 was to short I felt..

--- 帖子 #785 ---
rebel, I think EU can sell now with 4545 stop loss..

--- 帖子 #786 ---
It was 53 pips profit, but not taken.. because I am aiming for 6000 level.. and the level 6172 still collecting big sell volume for a big drop hopefully..

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Very interesting. Thanks for posting kareem, I'll have to play around with this a little see how I can incorporate it. Here's one by the book that I took based on your notes Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #788 ---
gbpusd going good, so far +95 pips profit, not closed.. moved sl to entry... looking for 6000 level...

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hi Rebelheart, Like your combination of RSI and Stochastic (have you tried trading Stochastic extremes with this setup?) If you use the stoch extremes with RSI S/R levels, you will have a pretty robust simple system! If you should add Bollinger Bands using say 2 std devs. then the bands will contain 95% of price movement (which is a pretty strong level for support and resistance ) - sooo when price is at/near a band, and this corresponds to a stoch extreme, which also lines up with an RSI S/R level - YOU HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY TRADE!!!!!! Trendlines - RSI pivots are helpful in drawing trendlines on price - drawing the trendline on the price bar associated with the pivot (just remember RSI is usually based on the closing price) An other thing about trendlines - they will always be tested and ultimately broken. So once you have 2 RSI pivots (or price pivots) you can draw a trendline, if the slope of your trendline gives an acceptable $/unit of time, why not just sit back and wait for the trendline break to take your profits? The higher the timeframe used, the greater the return, and the more relaxed trading experience Simple low risk trading All the above is simple S/R trading!! Enjoy your trading Peter http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

hI Kareem, Thank you. Could not resist posting as Rebelhearts layout is very similar to my main setup which is my default layout - tells me everything I need to know -use with multiple timeframes and its pretty hot http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif Have a good day Peter

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I see it now Peter....makes lots of sense. Thanks

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Again, one more based on the original rules, 2/2 so far with some discretion along the way. Exit may be a little premature even though there was a slight violation of the rsi trendline that I usually wouldn't regard as important, but it's a 00 level and throughout the day it was been a resistance multiple times. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think this is a very nice method so far implemented a long with regular PA analysis to filter out some noise.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Jonas, it might be my subjective impression, but since I trade ( execute ) at Oa..., don`t you too have the impression that the RSI readings ( and BTW the WMA averages ) are usually more precise than at MT4 brokers ? I noticed this as a breach of the line is signalled usually earlier than at both my regular MT4 broker and my ECN MT4 broker ( which I both use primarily for charting ). Good trading.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Hi msmarple, That's not something I noticed or paid attention to now that you mention it. If I do use an indicator, which is very rare, I try to run it on the same platform I execute so I get the right signals, or base everything on mt4 since it's usually easier. If that is in fact the case, my first question would be if the same data for the calculations is used (closed and closed prices or if Oanda uses open vs mt4 closed by default). I mean as long as your tests are consistent and profitable, it doesn't matter as long as you stick with one in that case. This is interesting if you saw a deviation there though, I don't work much with indis so it's not something I've experienced, sorry.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
yes,you are right.i also use Oa...(after i used MT4 for 6 month)and i think that RSI responds earlier and clear.i also want to thanks all of you for your contribution about the study of RSI.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Thanks for sharing your trades with us Jonaslt. By the Way I follow the same rule of trading/charts. I use MT4 with IBFX. I did catch one of the same trades you had. Kareem

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Hi Kareem, Thank you for showing a chart of my default setup. If I may, there is one setting that I would change - the 21 period RSI is way to sluggish in defining the RSI levels - using a 9 period or possibly a 14 period would be more appropriate. Overlay a 9 period on the 21 period and see the difference - then refer back to my earlier posts on RSI S/R levels, they work very well (well at least for my stocks) http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif My layout may look a bit cluttered to some, but I am a bit lazy, I let my indicators do the work, I have complete faith in them as I know them pretty well. All I need is a quick glance at a chart to know if there is a possible trade. No need to draw new price S/R or new Fibonacci lines etc etc For me , trading S/R is the name of the game and the RSI and Bollinger Bands define them excellently - no ifs, buts or maybe The stochastic is just a timing tool However - PRICE IS KING, it must confirm any analysis i.e. it must show follow through in the direction of the analysis before taking or exiting a trade. The RSI must be one of the most versatile and informative trading aids available, and well worth the effort required to understand its nuances Trade management is what determines whether or not we are profitable, discipline and low risk trades determine whether or not we stay in business I hope the above will be of use to some readers - its only my opinion. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Don't worry, be happy Peter

Peter Thanks for your input a few posts back, made the changes and was lucky to catch EU on the way down..

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Hi Rebelheart, Nice one! http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif Trading extremes can be really good and they tend to have a high success rate. On your trade you had advanced warning of the move with the Stoch being oversold and the price being outside the upper band (which is an unsustainable condition and suggests that price will move back inside the band and typically retrace to the mean - 20sma). Having the advanced warning, maybe you could have trailed a stop below the price bars?. RSI backed it up also, Mr Dependable. S/R forever Peter

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Hi again Rebelheart, Just looking at your chart again - to continue the analysis (I do not have access to Forex charts - so I do not know the outcome - Stock trader) As the RSI is in a consolidation phase - this is where patterns tend to form and is a good place to draw trendlines over the price action (or RSI trace) That being so you could draw a triangle encumposing the last 4 price bars Price is at the Bol Band 20sma (which is another form of S/R) and the Stoch is at oversold and turning up So what was the outcome? Hopefully an upmove http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon11.gif ? Peter

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Peter price broke the lower line on the triangle by 13 pips, then went on north, when the breach accured the stcocks where heading up and rsi down, so id like to think in real time I would not have taken the trade, how ever when price breaks out at the top stocks are still heading up and rsi has broken R line... would have been nice to have been here to take that one, I will try to incorperate more drawing on my charts channels, wedges and the like... thanks again for you comments as always very helpfull and thought perfoking.. Rebel Worst Speller in the world..

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Hi Rebel, Well there you go, you win some, you lose some, another business expence, that's trading! HOWEVER. I would not have gotten into this trade either if it had kept going down. - I would only trade in the direction of the stoch My entry would have been on a break of the upper trendline forming the triangle. If I had a pre order in the market, it would have been picked up as price reversed, but that would have been a fluke. Its good practise to trade in the direction of the stoch. Entry on a breach of the trendline would have been an aggressive entry A more conservative entry: As this breakout was from within the RSI range trading zone (40-60) Wait until the rsi trace breaks above 60 for a long, or below 40 for a short The odds are: Above 60 confirms the start of an uptrend or below 40 confirms the start of a downtrend For info: We can also have a trend start from a reversal, or trend continuation from a major correction/retracement Example - Long When we have a downtrend or a major correction from an upmove, when this ends, price will either - reverse, pause and then reverse, pause and then continue down, or start range trading The RSI will be in the 20 area The Stoch will be oversold The stoch will give a buy signal - but we do not know if this signal will reverse as it hangs around the 20 line and signal a downtrend continuation. We should wait until the RSI passes up thro 40 before entering long - as we now have the makings of a new uptrend - if it continues up and passes thro 60 -great! The above works for me, before using any of this ALWAYS check it out for yourself Thanks for the chart Rebel (one of these days I might start trading Forex) Have a great day - hope you are not snowed in over there, weathers great here in Australia and the pool looks crystal clear-30 degrees (like jumping in the bath) Peter http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hello everyone. I finally decided to jump into the conversation. I have been trading RSI for about 2 mos now. I started with Woodies CCI, but found I like the RSI better. I figured out about the trends line and using the 50 line kind of on my own from just sitting there and watching the indicator for 2 weeks w/o placing a trade. Having read through the rest of the post, you all have shown me even more pearls to use (20/60 &amp; 40/80 relationships for instance). Out of pure curiosity I did a search on RSI in the forums and found this thread. I should tell you, it is a treasure trove to be sure. Anyway enough sunshine. I use the RSI w/ a setting of 21, along with what i call a stochastic array. Basically coded the following as a complete study for the thinkorswim platform: RSI; 21, Stoch: 5/3, 8/5. 17,3, 44,3. i use the 5/3 as a timing for the current timeframe I am using (5min) and the longer stochs give me a clue as to what is happening on the progressively longer TF's (15m,30m,2hr). I posted a pic of a recent trade i had. I didn't get max pips as closed out the remaining contracts price hit my second target. Lesson: Be patient, let the indicator do what it is supposed to do. Oh well, live and learn. Thanks for all of the great info, keep up the good work. The heavy yellow line is the RSI.

The rsi and stoch are both momentum indicators, but obviously constructed differently. They both operate between 0 and 100 limits However: The RSI(9): uses three zones to move between 0 and 100 1.e. uptrend - 40-80, above 80 is an extreme downtrend - 20-60, below 20 is an extreme overlapping zone - 40-60 where price will be range trading, or passing thro from a downtrend to an uptrend and vice versa. The Stochastic: The stoch can travel its whole range 0-100 (20-80) in measuring a single move i.e. it is much more responsive than the RSI When we combine the two - its like looking at the big picture via the RSI while the Stoch buy and sell signals determine the individual moves that form the building blocks in the construction of the RSI chart Here's something to try out to see if the combination can work for you.(This is only one of the uses of this combination) Trading the RSI S/R levels RSI(9) S/R Levels: 20,40, 60,80 and (50?) Price must confirm your analysis i.e. If price is moving up to or at the 60 level and stoch (5,3,3,) is at oversold and giving a buy signal - then the odds are that the 60 level will break In this case put a buy order in just above the high of the signal bar (the bar at/near the resistance level[60]) Stop location?- depends on your risk tolerance. I set mine just below the signal bar. PS When the stoch gives a buy/sell signal at any of the RSI S/R levels - it is always worth checking out The market is driven by fear and greed i.e. the pyschology of the crowd (participants). If we become part of the crowd, we tend to act in a similar manner to the crowd - who are losers! Stand back and do your own analysis - what works for you!! Hi Ronin, Nice to see you posting, I'm sure Kareem will welcome you to his thread I colour code my RSI levels to coincide with what I call the uptrend and downtrend as defined by Andrew Cardwell (think that's his name - he is the MAN) green: 40 and 80 red: 20 and 60 Wish I knew how to hatch in the 40-60 area - too complicated for me But I'm good at switching my computer on and off. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif The RSI has other applications, including helping to filter out false Stoch signals. Nothing is perfect. Have a nice weekend Peter.

Interesting comment that you made about the RSI-- "The RSI must be one of the most versatile and informative trading aids available, and well worth the effort required to understand its nuances" I have know it for years. When I started working with it in 1978 I knew I had found something. And from what I have seen in some of the posts here, others also realize it is a powerful tool and indicator. The ways in which I use it and have built models based on my RSI work that are very different. However, I do want to let traders know that there are some people who are claiming to know my work, (some have even claimed some of my work as their own by just changing the names of my Positive / Negative Reversals). Just a warning to be aware of what is out there and by whom. I still offer my courses and original work if you wish to learn it directly from me. You can reach me at cardwellrsiatgmaildotcom Andrew Cardwell [qote=lizpet;3360306]Hi Kareem, Thank you for showing a chart of my default setup. If I may, there is one setting that I would change - the 21 period RSI is way to sluggish in defining the RSI levels - using a 9 period or possibly a 14 period would be more appropriate. Overlay a 9 period on the 21 period and see the difference - then refer back to my earlier posts on RSI S/R levels, they work very well (well at least for my stocks) http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif My layout may look a bit cluttered to some, but I am a bit lazy, I let my indicators do the work, I have complete faith in them as I know them pretty well. All I need is a quick glance at a chart to know if there is a possible trade. No need to draw new price S/R or new Fibonacci lines etc etc For me , trading S/R is the name of the game and the RSI and Bollinger Bands define them excellently - no ifs, buts or maybe The stochastic is just a timing tool However - PRICE IS KING, it must confirm any analysis i.e. it must show follow through in the direction of the analysis before taking or exiting a trade. Trade management is what determines whether or not we are profitable, discipline and low risk trades determine whether or not we stay in business I hope the above will be of use to some readers - its only my opinion. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Don't worry, be happy Peter[/quote]

The patterns you are speaking of "MDRP's are what John Hayden renamed my original work I called Positive and Negative Reversals. There are a lot of people who have written articles and books claiming some of my work as their own. John was one of my course students who probably without my courses could have not written a book. You can reach me at cardwellrsiatgmaildotcom.

Hi Ronin, Thank you for your post. I hope to see more post/charts about your set up. I have tried TOS before and it is a nice platform. Kareem

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi Peter, I am currently using your levels on all of my charts, stocks and FX. Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Looks like Mr Cardwell has put me in my place, and it is true that I first read about the 20,40 etc levels in John Hadens book. That was when I realised the potential of the RSI and started "playing around with it a bit more" I have no intention of stepping on his toes or taking any credit. I was just telling the RSI story as I see and use it So I'll leave it to him. I'm too old for any confrontational stuff - only thing is he'll probably charge you for his expertise. Trade what you see Peter

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hi Kareem and friends Just a parting shot....... If you believe in the RSI S/R levels - they may be a good location from which to start drawing your trendlines thro the RSI peaks or troughs (makes sense to me) I tried it on a few stocks this afternoon and it proved to be quite reliable - I'm sure it can be refined Helpful condition: If the Bollinger Bands are wide apart and more or less running horizontal - this suggests range trading conditions, and the distance between the bands will give you an idea if or not the risk / reward is worth trading. The bands will also be wide at turning points (end of trends and possible reversals) Trade for profit, not to be right. Peter

OK you asked for more, so here goes. Please bear with me as I try to describe what I look for in one type of set up. First let me say that I don’t solely rely on the RSI for trade signals. I feel that PA has to be reinforced by whatever indicator(s) you should choose to apply. Also, I believe support and resistance is vital in understanding not only where price may be headed, but where it came from (more on this another time). Below I posted one example of what I look for when trading anything intraday utilizing a top down approach. So there is no misunderstanding, this is NOT a trade I took, (it was New Years Eve day here in the states. Paint dries faster than the market moves then) but it serves as a fine example none the less. In the first chart (USDJPY 2hr) I’ll have you note the red vertical line. This is to give a point of reference as we progress down the TF’s. You see that the price has stalled and the RSI (heavy yellow line) is showing weakness, having breached into the overbought area (&gt;70 in this case). But just as important is how the stochs (other colored lines) are converging together almost to a point. This is significant in that it shows the short (5/3-purple &amp; 8/5-green), medium (17/3-red) and long term (44/3-pinkish) momentum have all converging to the same point (overbought in this case) and starting to roll over. The nice thing about this set up, is it takes some time for this event to occur, giving you plenty of time to coordinate the other time frames, and work out your entry and exit. On the next chart (USDJPY 30m) you’ll see the same event occuring.The PA, RSI, and stochs are demonstrating the same characteristics as the 2hr. Makes sense as the 30m builds into the 2 hr. Next chart (USDJPY 15m) on this chart we see the same characteristics, but now we can see the divergence of the RSI and Price. The price is making a higher high, while the RSI makes a dbl top. Make special note of the stochs in this chart. They have already gone through their convergence (blue vertical line) and have begun to breakdown. Finally The last chart (USDJPY 5m)! You can see that the stochs had converged several hours prior to the red vertical line and that the RSI has been weakening during this time as well. However, it’s not until the red &amp; Pink stochs fall &lt;80, ( at the red vertical line) that price finally starts to breakdown as well. My entry would be on the close the green candle next to the vertical line (approx 93.10), as this is where the near term resistance is to be found, thereby giving you a low risk, high probability trade. Believe it or not I typically only use a 10 pip stop with this setup as my statistics show an avg MAE (Maximum Adverse Excursion, or amount of heat taken during trade life) of 6 pips. As you can see, this set up is one that can be seen well in advance and requires some amount of patience as you wait for its completion. In retrospect I wish I HAD taken the trade, but, as I said earlier, it was New Years Eve day in the states, and this is a pretty thinly traded time (plus the fact it was the last trading day of the week…don’t care much for ‘over-the-weekend’ carries). Oh well….next trade J . Thanks for letting me ramble on, I hope I didn’t bore any of you too much. Happy Trades!

i'm very,very sorry and i apollogise with you because i don't now how to put a chart on forum(i use Oa...),but i'll explain to you.look AUD/USD dailly chart with RSI 14 and draw a trend line on rsi.you'll see how after the broke,the R becomes S-the pull back off price action-(you have to notice that the SL could be hit and is risky).now change RSI 21 and you'll see how the same trend line can take inside even the pull back and brokes in a safer way.however RSI brokes earlier than the price. P.S. it is only my humble opinion.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
in 14/21 it is all about how your trade way is-conservative or agressive-.in an agressive way you could take the first candle after the reject from S (trend line)point,meanwhile in conservative way you wait the broke and maybe a confirmation off price.

Hey everyone, It’s me again. This time I wanted to share my method for buying an OTM Option having a good chance of success. I’ve always felt buying an OTM option was a bit like buying a lottery ticket, low risk, low probability. But there is a way to buy an OTM option that does have a ‘better than not’ chance of giving you a return. Maybe even a big one. The chart I posted has a lot going on so I’ll try to explain as clear as I can (I don’t think any of you are dense, I am just not always good at getting the stuff outta my head and thru my mouth ). Again using top down analysis, I placed an alert about 2 weeks prior to this trade on the SPY (S&amp;P 500 ETF) to tell me when price hit $115. Well the morn of Monday January 11, 2010 it triggered pretty much right after the US market open. So I bought some SPY FEB10 $109 puts, here’s why: SPY 30m chart: You’ll have to trust me on this; during the week prior to this all of my stochs had already converged and have begun to breakdown on the 30m charts and the RSI has been ever so painfully slowly losing elevation. I use this for my entry and exits when doing this type of trade, but look at weekly &amp; daily for the set up signals. On the chart at the very top you’ll see a pink horizontal line (115.27) this is a resistance level from the monthly chart, the reason I set alert. My expectation is that price will approach/hit this and then retrace. Anyone who has been watching the US markets and is a contrarian has noticed the weakness and has been waiting for the pull back. Unfortunately this has been the case for many weeks! But I am no different, but I digress. To continue; as I said I bought some FEB 109 puts, and by mid day the market gave me my target (I know, I shoulda had one before I started). You can see that to the right of the blue vertical line, at mid day, SPY hit support, and the RSI &amp; stochs (particularly the pinkish one-long term momentum) have all begun to fall away from overbought. At this point, I expected a dbl top would be forming, and using the fib tool pick the highest peak (first 30m bar of the day) and dragged down until the 50% line was at the low of the (assumed) valley, using the price at the 0% line as my target. You notice how this lines up very nicely with a prior support line (lucky me ). Now according to Candlestick theory, the midpoint of the big candle (again the first) is near term S&amp;R. This area proved to be correct at the end of the day as price was rejected, thereby giving me my potential second peak. At the same time make note that the RSI has been rejected by the 70 line and has turned downward. So far all systems are ‘go’. The next morning, I was given a gift when price gapped down at the open below the LOD of the day before (green S/R line), was rejected and steadfastly marched down to my target, the next S/R line. Once there, I sold my puts for nice, quick 40% gain. Now was there some luck involved, probably. But trading is finding the situations where the odds are on our side for success, right? Remember, a good set up always works…..until it doesn’t. This time it did for me. In case you may have noticed, on Thursday 2 days later, price hit the $115 area again. Yes, I did the same thing, FEB 109 puts. This time however, my target is $111 as the price action for this week produced another intraday dbl top, and the RSI on the daily has finally broken my trendline. I’ll have to let you know how it all turns out. Thanks again for putting up with me and Happy Trades!

i was talking about this difference

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Unlike my earlier posts, this trade utilized PA, S&amp;R, and RSI (no stochs this time) Despite a misread of things this morning this trade did work out a little for me, but I had to work for it. As depicted by the red vertical line, I entered the trade @ 1.4393 (short) as the RSI had broken my trend line, or so I thought. I waited patiently for the price decline, but as you can see in the chart, it didn’t come (at least not when I expected). As I said in an earlier post I use a 10pip SL per my stats, and as the chart shows, I needed it. I had decided to let this one breathe rather than close out, so you don’t think I suffer from a need to be right (I have a wife and 5 kids, so usually the only thing I am right about is being wrong! ), here’s why. First off, as you can see on the chart, there was quite a bit of resistance above at 1.4398, &amp; the often used ’00.00’. This is apparent from the long wicks on the candle tops. Taking this and the wedge pattern into account, I determined that one of four things would most likely happen and here they are in order of likely hood: 1) the market loves to test, so I would have the opportunity to close out at a smaller loss, 2) as I said the market loves to test, so it would fall back to 1.4383 allowing me a few pips to put into my pocket, 3) The market would test 1.4383 and it will fail, and I can play on, 4) price would test the 1.4400 are yet again and break thru (meaning this post would be demonstrating a loss). Do not mistake this as hope, it’s just how markets move (a hard lesson for me to learn, and maybe a topic for another day). Anyway, as depicted by the blue vert line, price did fall back to test 1.4383. At this point I reevaluated my charts, and as you can see: the 2hr RSI had turned away from its trend line, the 30m had broken through its trend line as had the 15m. Seeing this, I decided I was now in the trade I should’ve been and to allow the trade to continue on its course (albeit with a lousy entry price). It may seem I merely found what I wanted, to justify staying in a losing trade, but I assure you, I would’ve closed out in a heartbeat if and/or when things changed. And changed it did, lol. As depicted by the second red vert line, I closed out at 1.4381 when the RSI broke the minor trend line, giving my 10 pips for this one. Bad entry, poor R/R, all because I anticipated a move in price. Someday I’ll learn. BTW, I see these posts can get pretty lengthy, if this or anything else is a problem, please let me know. My goal is to join in the discussion, not step on toes or be viewed as a loud mouth. Happy Trades!

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Thank you, very informative. However, with this low volume at the moment i doubt if technical analysis weighs that much. What I like especially : a) (I have a wife and 5 kids, so usually the only thing I am right about is being wrong! ) Wonderful. b) your explanations, showing the thought process clearly. c) having the opportunity to see RSI related trades taken on a different chart platform and comparing the reading to my own version. Thank you !

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Thank you for the kind words of encouragement. I was hoping I was making sense with my explanations and not sounding preachy. I would have to agree about the volume on a Bank Holiday. In fact I was surprised to see any real movement past 11:00am CST. But there was enough to sneak 31 pips out of it, so for that I am grateful. So as to keep things even, I will post losing trades as well. I think it's misleading to only post winners, something you see a lot of in most forums. I have noticed here at FF, folks are willing to show both sides of the trade. Lets face it, there's only one real guarantee in trading, you're going to lose at some point, right? If there are no complaints, I will most certainly continue with these posts.

Hi igmal, I am still working with the 21. My guess is that it should not matter much as long as you don't keep changing. Use on and stick with it for some time ( like a year or two). Thanks Kareem

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Hi Ronin, Thanks for the posts. I do like your set ups and posts. I hope you keep them coming. My only feed back is that 10 pips is too tight. What I do now is when I feel that my stop is too tight, I cut my position in half and double my stop. Stops are good, but "unfilled" stops are best. Please keep your posts coming. Kareem

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Forgive me. i see I had never mentioned that the 10 pip SL is my initial placement. As the trade matures and after having reached 15 pips I move it to breakeven where it stays until trade completion. kareem, thank you for your input and I hope to hear more. My intention for posting is not only to demonstrate what has been working for me, but also to find any flaws that mat exist. My goal in trading is to do so well, and let the profits take care of themselves. So don't be shy. I believe in the saying of 'traders helping traders'. Its a BIG market and we are after all the smallest part.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
thank you karem!it is ALL about the study of RSI.you have perfectly right that we have to stick and make no changes.i think that this great thread helps us to understand how rsi act in different market'conditions.the good or bad trades(advices,etc) are welcome as long as we have something to learn.i thank of all of you. P.S. It is just a humble opinion.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
OK, I know this set up doesn't involve FX, but I did mention it earlier and promised a follow up. As you can see in the first chart, after having bought the SPY FEB109 puts again last Thursday, I should have been happy at the close on Friday. But with the long weekend, the MM's had sucked out the volatility of the options, and with a lot of time left I figured I would let them stew a little longer. Jump to this past Tuesday. I won't lie, I was a little nervous that price would breach the high from last week. But price was bumping its head against strong resistance, and the studies were all over bought. So, again, lots of time left (though it was decaying) til expiration, so I'd thought I'd stick it out. Yesterday brought a smile to my face, as it gapped down and by the close, the RSI had again broken my trendline (see second chart SPY Day). The final nail came for me as this morning I took a peek at the ES (S&amp;P futures) and saw the smiley face looking at me (see last chart 2hr-extended hours), ES had formed a Head and Shoulders. So I measured out the target, which coincided nicely with a support level at 111.56. I thought I missed the boat in the morning, but after lunchtime saw that the RSI was still weakening, so I set a conditional order to close if/when SPY hit 111.75 again. I didn't have to wait too long as it hit after 2pm CST for nice 65% return. So anyway, I said I let you all know how it worked out. Since this is an FX forum, I will keep the option plays out from now on. I feel that I should also apologize for hijacking the thread like this. Happy Trades!

Hi, I'm also trading with the RSi indi. I have not been doing it for very long, but the way I trade it has been making me some good pips. I'm attaching some charts. Please don't ask for TP or SL. It differs all the time. It is determined by how the market moves. I'm attaching my live account graph. I had a small account, $60. Lost all but only $5. I'm now recovering slowly but surely.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hmmm.. I Don't use any indicators for my trading except candle sticks (if you want to call that an indicator) and trend lines / S-R levels. However, using the RSI in this method is very interesting. Recently i have been playing the Eur/Usd and im seeing that if i had use the RSI in this method, i would of been well off to even better results. I will be adding this to my strategy as this seems much more useful than the buy when RSI is oversold and Sell when overbought..etc. Nice job. BTW, i Only trade 4Hr and Daily.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Great trade. And yes keep posting. By the way I ( Day) trade the SPY and QQQQ as well. Not option but the ETF it self. I took that same trade in the Qs, it was goof for 20c on halft and 40c on the rest. Plus you are giving great trading information for any market. Thanks Kareem

Welcome NYWallst and thanks for the post. I like trading naked as well, but the RSI can mask some of the noise the price candles can show. Also the RSI is like a "Swiss Knife" indicator, good for entries, exits, trendig and ranging markets. Also works very well for S/R. Hope to see more posts from you. Kareem

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Hey Kareen. I was going through some charts of the previous 2 weeks and i must say, although i did profit, Using the RSI in this way would have really shot my account capital up. Definitely a good strategy, However, will take some getting used to as i have not had an indicator window on my charts for a while.

hi kareem!in the moment i reed your post i trade the same pair.this is a daily chart.look the level of SR.in 4hseems to be a pin.in 1h RSI meets SR to 70 level and turn.all these make me to be short.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
now i'm on this,but i don't know if it can broke 50 level.i think that RSI will turns to 40 level and then reject up(or turns to trend line when R becomes S).thanks. P.S.my humble opinion.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
I've noted that if you draw a trend line in certain time frame,sometimes it could be used as RS level in smaller time frame. My humble opinion.

Another nice way to trade the RSI. It makes lots of since and again ahead of the price action break out. Thanks for sharing.

I do agree, but I am still trying to find a set up that works most ( okay 60-80%) of the time.

I started these trades with study of daily chart.i noticed the hammer candle right on 50 retracement.at the open of the last candle(today candle)i took long for many reasons(50 retracement,hammer canle,but first of all the broke of RSI).the price reached the trend line of price action,and i didn't know if the price could have broke or not.i followed RSI in 1h and in the moment of broke,i was out(with a nice +).then i shorted for another candle.i stoped because RSI reached 50 level and i was afraid by the yesterday hammer candle .i want to thanks all of you(especially kareem)because all the elements of these trades i learned from you in this thread. My humble opinion.

Andy, Kareem - too long time, no communicate... just thought I'd post my current - and probably FINAL - RSI setup. I've veered towards Andy's RSI 14, BUT it is in fact a "Fozzy" RSI 8 smoothed 3 periods : it crosses exactly where RSI 14 crosses the 50 line, but it's a little smoother, more gentle on my old eyes.

Hi, I've read most of this thread with great interest. With no posts lately, just wondering if anyone id still trading this RSI trend line break system and if so, how profitable you are finding it. Thanks, Gem

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Hi Gem, I still do use it, in addition to other indicators/setups. I only use the RSI trade with longer time frames ( 1H or higher). Thank you, Kareem

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hello Kareem40, Interesting system, can you tell me which peaks/troughs you decide to take for your trendline. The reason I ask is because sometimes there are earlier peaks which you ignore for your trend line which may have got you in earlier if you had used them. I can would be so kind as to explain that would be helpful for me to make my decisions. Dave

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Hi Dave, When I traded shorter time frames ( such as 5M) I wanted to get as many peaks as possible, not just the first one. Now with the 1H/4H charts I start the trend line after the first peak. Please note trendlines drawing is and can be an art, so different people tend to draw them differently. I will post some charts next week. Kareem

Hi Kareem and Others, I noticed that you use this system for trading both trend, counter-trend and ranges. Has anyone tested this system using it only as a trend following system by only trading in the direction of the upper timeframe trend. Sharon

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Hi Sharon, The RSI can be used as a trend following system, where you are quite happy to give back a sizable portion of your profit in exchange for the possibility of hitting a much larger return than if you were just using it to trade an individual move or whatever For an uptrend: A trend can start from a trend reversal i.e RSI passing up thro 40 level A trend can start from consolidation i.e. RSI has been trading between 40 and 60 - and breaks out above 60 or We can have a trend continuation where the trace either passes up thro 60 or rebounds back up of the 40 level The trend has not reverted to a downtrend until it falls below 40 Use the opposite for a downtrend Its always nice when your RSI signal breaks a trendline drawn thro the relevant RSI peaks or troughs Its nice to see that you use multiple timeframe analysis, as I have found them to be so important in defining the structure of the market and therefore the trade potential As regards testing - this is something that is best done by the person who is considering using the "system" NEVER take as gospel ANYTHING that you read on any forum, you must check it out for yourself - and be comfortable with the experience You will probably add the odd filter which you have found useful in the past But you should try to keep it as simple as possible - we all tend to complicate things (our filters tend to creep in more and more over time, if we are not careful) Hope this helps Peter

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Hi Peter, Thanks for your detailed answer. You've given me a few things to think about. I started testing this system just today after spending the past few weeks researching ways to filter this system. Apart from trading only in the upper time frame direction, I could not come up with any other filters. I was pleasantly surprised with the performance of this system today (without any extra filters). Early days yet, but I think I may finally have settled on a simple yet powerful system which I feel really comfortable trading. Many thanks to you, Kareem and all the others who have contributed to this thread. Happy trading Sharon

Hi Sharon, The RSI is pretty powerful when used "correctly", and does not lag as so many gurus say!. Anyway, if you have checked out the RSI S/R levels and find that they work for you - then multiple timeframe trading becomes that more meaningful As an example, if we use say the monthly, weekly and daily charts i.e. then the daily bars are the building blocks of the weekly and the weekly bars are the building blocks of the monthly. Get these all lined up and your odds of a winning trade are greatly increased So for an upmove: We would look for a trade setup on the weekly Check the monthly to ensure that there is no nearby overhead resistance, or the trace is not at an extreme, or the trace is not showing signs of the trend weakening If they check out OK , this gives us the probability of the weekly moving in the "expected" direction (overall) We then go to the daily for our entry and stop loss points Example RSI trace falls to a support level - say 40 on the weekly (we expect this to hold) Check the monthly to ensure its RSI trace is not at an extreme i.e. &gt;80 (in some really strong moves the RSI trace can stay above 80 for some time, but this is the exception, not the rule), check that it is not giving a bearish divergence with price or is not approaching a RSI resistance level - if all is well, then go to the daily and look for an entry e.g. RSI trace passing up thro 40 or 60 or rebounding of support. There you go - something else to think about I'm going back into hibernation Sharon the RSI is really very good, it works well with the MACD (12,26,1), just use the MACD trace turning up or down as signals - gets rid of the noise and keeps you in the trade without getting turfed out on false signals Another useful indicator is the Stoch (5,3,3) use this to locate divergence on the RSI (I'm sure you can work it out) Well thats my contribution for another year Keep smiling Peter

Thank you Kareem, look forward to seeing your charts.

Hi Peter, Thank you for the post. Nice to hear from you again. Kareem

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Hi Sharon, Thank you for the post. I wish you the best in your new system and please feel free to share any charts in the near future. I will start posting again soon.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Peter, Thanks for more of your insights. Haven't had much time the last day or so. Will check out this system combined with MACD/Stoch as you've suggested. Thanks Again for your help. Sharon

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hi Kareem, Thanks for your post. Will try out this system for a full week next week and let you know how I go. Thanks, Sharon

Hi, I created an indicator that displays RSI trendline. It may be useful for this strategy. It is the default MT4 RSI indicator but with an added trendline. the second parameter "TL_bars" may be 1 or 2, it is the count of how many bars define a swing high/low of a trendline. you may see the difference on the example attached. in my opinion 2 is better. It seems to be a quite good confirmation method using RSI 14 or 21. regards, Gyula

--- 帖子 #873 ---
This is great. Thank you much Gyula. I will install and watch. for the past year I have been using this set up on higher time frame. Mostly 1 and 4H charts. Kareem

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Great job Szgy74 Thanks for sharing it!

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Hi Kareem/ Gyula, Here's an application that may be of interest, that makes use of the RSI trendline to enter a new trend..... A great way to use the RSI trendline is to use it to identify price /RSI divergence Looking for bearish divergence in the RSI (9) 80 level zone, and bullish divergence in the RSI(9) 20 level zone Application Entry If the 1st two pivot peaks/troughs through which the RSI trendline is drawn - show a divergence with price - then enter on the next bar. Exit Break of the RSI trendline, if the trend accelerates you could consider an exit before price breaks the TL or use whatever your trading plan says.Maybe consider exiting on the trace of the MACD (12.26.1) when it goes flat or turns over, or maybe a candlestick reversal sig. etc etc etc Trade Logic If the RSI trace is in the 20 or 80 zone, then there is a trend in place The accurance of divergence indicates weakness in the existing move - so the probability of trend reversal, and new trend is more likely If the 2nd pivot is a candlestick reversal bar or part of a reversal signal - so much the better Our RSI entry levels will be in the 20 or 80 zones, and these are zones where trend reversals tend to occur, so we will be getting in at the start of a possible new trend There you go - something to experiment with Peter

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Interesting and informative as always Peter. Nice to hear from you. I will watch the set up. Thank you, Kareem

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Here is a trade I am still holding. It broke a long tredline, so it should move some.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
I want to know more about RSI, Can you help me? professor Kareem40...

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Hi Sorry for the late reply. I no longer trade with the RSI method. It has been effective, but I have found a new trading method with even better results. I will do my best to start a new thread for my new trading method. Thanks

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Hojam,,, can you explain me about your new method ? (Please.......) I respect all of your researches...........it's two years that i'm follow your perfect methods.............Thanks again, Sincerely yours... Tesekurler !

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Please tell me when you want to start?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Can you tell me about your EMA settings? Thanks a lot.......

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I feel like give a life to this thread. RSI the master of all indicators (my own view). Please share your ideas guys.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
RSI - Not too much difference between various input values through short ranges like 10-25. Clearly, the shorter the input, the more volatile the RSI, but the formations are generally similar. In addition, if you watch closely, one can see that during choppy conditions, RSI can be defeated. That is RSI becomes very choppy as well.

why you used RSI PERIOD 21 for 5 minutes chart what is the relation of RSI PERIOD with TIME CHART? if i will increase the time frame like 15 minutes or 30 or month so how i will change the RSI PERIOD i means what formula i will apply to set the RSI PERIOD?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi, I too checked, the book link does not seems to work. Could you please update the book with the working link. Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I think, the more the period of the RSI, it will filter the noice and gives you less signals. I use the default 14 period and I am fine with it. I have seen few people who use RSI 9 period for intraday ( to get more signals) and few people use 21/23 (to get less signals).

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Me too , I will be pleased if you upload the book again or a valid working link to download it Thnak you in advance .

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi, clic on the clip at the top of the first page, the link worked for me!

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I use RSI always. Sometimes based on h4 to check cycle. then H1... then will entry at m5... usually take 3-5 pips only. It's baby pips

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) An example of bullish RSI range trade on GoldMini @MCX Last time GoldMini entered Bullish RSI range was on 10th Aug 2018 ( ride from 29836 to 56499 )

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hello Kareem and everyone, I use RSI indicator also on orderblocks H4 and have antries on H1 or M15. I have read this strategy and I find it very useful. I will test it the next week live, as I see from the charts backtesting it works, and as I understand from all of you it doesn't repaint. But I have one question? I see at the posts that you trade mostly EUR/USD. It only works at this pair? Has anybody else have tried it to other pairs, commodities or even stocks? Thank you.
