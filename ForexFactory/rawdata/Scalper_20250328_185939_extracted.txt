Scalper Update April 9th 2014 .. for the 2nd model of my scalping strategy please refer to page 31 post 609 and beyond. thx Update April 11th 2014.. for the 3rd model, pg 35 post 689. Scalp your way to profit day in day out. Been trading all kinds of market for a long time as a solid producer. I’ll share one of my currency scalping. A word from a scalper: Scalper’s biggest asset is the ability to feel the heat and be stone cold to act upon. .. let’s get on with it.. I am a do-er and not much of a talk-er.. -5m tf.. watch dog it the whole London session on eu/ej/gu/gj -Two indies to plot: TMA band &amp; MACD.. (tma 56,100,2.0.. macd 6,14,0)-Entry: Buy on the close of the first bullish narrow mac bar candle on a bearish/os tma.. and vice versa for sell. Price must clearly separate itself from the band by at least one candle, prefer to have a visible gap, and the entry point bar candle to be outside of the band as well. -Target and Stops: looking to bank minimum of 15-20 pips and more if fall into a lucky ride. The initial hard stop at trigger time sets at 50 pips for emergency purposes. -Order placements: 3.3 pips + spread from high/low of the entry candle for trigger and stops. That’s it. Art of the work : Risk control management. This part is your make or break, so pay mass of attention to fully understand in order to implement it correctly.. it requires developed skill based on a understanding to never be betrayed. Here we go.. before target reach, on the first HEAT coming against your position is where risk drops to minimal.. how!!.. (listen carefully).. first closed mac bar candle against your position is where you reduce the risk to for new stop point.. once you are forced to set a tight stop against your position it’s also to be treated as an alert to exit for the least damage before SL take out. OK, at this point you evaluate where your new stop is.. if it’s 7pips and under you let the trade be to either reach the target or take out your SL unless it stalls for too long.. if the stop is more than 7 pips, then on the first attempt back to breakeven zone you will try to exit at minimal loss with no feelings attached what so ever. Got it!!.. it’s supper manual, it requires to be fast on the head and fingers which develops a skill and feel for speed and rhythm.. there will be times that this return back attempt is too strong and breaks out from entry point in favor of your position.. in such case you will allow some leniency and let it play out for a strong resume to reach your profit target, BUT anything short of that you will stick to the exit plan. Done. This is as best as a structure I could give to go by without confusing or overloading you. Practice will make perfect. You will see me in action many many times as I trade my account live. It’s a chance to witness in full to absorb as I’ll attach a small size explorer account which will reflect my scalping trades on it. Do not count on too many live chart pictures since its fast pace.. that is why I attach explorer so I don’t have to post timely live charts, but I try in the beginning to squeeze some out on time. Some questions you may have right of the bat.. About me?.. well, you get to know me as we go along if you really care. How much do I make or what’s the potential?.. you’ll see and its got nothing to do with what you will make or lose. Potential depend on your skill and dedication. MM?.. its up to you.. I recommend to risk no more than 2% of your account per trade.. but once your skill is up and strong you can risk more like I do. Number of trades daily?.. its up to your dedication.. I watch dog the whole London session to death and trade anywhere from 5-15 trades a days. If your wishy-washy then you will get less opportunities and may create disruption. News?.. be aware of the major red news.. but for sure do not trade AT super majors such as NFP, Rate changes and Speeches. What about filtering? NO need for it.. plz keep all filtering ideas to yourself.. zero tolerance in this regard. I may have missed something’s.. you could bring it up and if I feel it’s relevant I’ll answer. Ok.. Last but not least.. I kindly ask of everyone to be respectful all around especially to your fellow traders.. be positive, active and energetic if this is your cup of tea, otherwise do me a favor and change the tune. I do not want any extra input from anyone about structure of the trading plan I have already laid out, it is what it is and will never be changed.. its proven and all other considerations, evaluation and etc, has been dealt with and calculated long ago. I start from European open normally which is an hour before London session. I have placed one chart just to show the looks of a basic entry and risk reduction. Talk at you tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
I be around for couple of hours or so.. if you got any question go ahead and shoot, so we can get the basic out of the way before start of the battle tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Which Tma indicator is it, there is a few floating around.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
use tma true.. good for back test too.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
thank you for sharing the system ..

--- 帖子 #6 ---
You're also using a special MACD that I can't find. Will you post it?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
TMA is a 56 LWMA with ATR bands around it set a whatever parameters you decide to give. Presumably not necessarily the same depending on volatility of the pair in question.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I couldn't tell from the pics what a "narrow mac bar" is...? Also, after the "first attempt against the position" you move your stoploss is that correct? thanks

--- 帖子 #9 ---
should everyone get their filter suggestions out of the way right off the bat?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
this is the mac i use..

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I understand.. below is the setting I use.. HL 56 ATR period 100 ATR multi 2.0

--- 帖子 #12 ---
NO.. as i mentioned in my 1st post. stick to original by mastering "the art of the work" section. casual entries, tough risk control. not limiting chances. I am sure there is a million ways to filter everything and anything but keeping it out of here. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Try to look close and you will see there are bold bars and not so bold bars, those are called narrow. yes i move the SL to above or below the mac bar candle against the position. With my mac settings basically on the 1st or 2nd candle against the position mac bar will confirm.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
i see. narrow bars are bars that move towards the zero line. doesn't that crush you in a really strong move when price stays outside the bands and macd exhaustion creates many narrow bars?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
NO.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi all, and FXEmpire, Interesting. My question is: we short when TMA is bullish, go long when it is bearish, so all trades are countertrend trades. Correct or did I misunderstand something? Happy pips to all gonso

--- 帖子 #17 ---
you are correct.. only counter trades.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
ok just got this explorer thing going, took me a while to figure it out.. anyways its done now.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
gu is possible to give out a signal.. price well separated from the band and first bearish mac bar candle we got a signal and a sell order must be placed.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Can you please post your TMA indicator and your template please. Thanks

--- 帖子 #21 ---
its only two indi my friend please make due.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hey can you please explain your exit strategy in more detail please? I have been following this thread and I am up 15 pips so far (15% of my account)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
nice green there FXE .. how about EU ?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Eu seems to be going down more Im waiting for another long trade on it looks like its getting set up now!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
what i have layed out is the best i can do with words... to get a good grasp of it one needs to follow my actions in the explorer account step by step.. watch the pending orders and change of stops.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
i took a shot at eu and got stung for -13.. plz pay attention to the explorer.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
How long have you been trading with this method?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
long time.. its not a method its a skill and one gets really tested when things get rough to dig your way out.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
let see how GJ perform .. practice..practice..practice !

--- 帖子 #30 ---
quick summery of my 3 trades up to now.. there has been 3 available so far and i took all 3 of them.. which is good gu.. was good for 10-15 banked +12 ej.. good for 25 but i took about +11... there was hesitation more than i like at +12 mark so i took what was available at the plate.. but if i wanted to stick with the mac i would have had the whole enchilada.. its ok maybe i goofed up. eu.. turned on me right away like a true fake out, so on the first mac bar candle against me i dropped the risk to -13 and was hit. I would never ever break the risk control rule. now after it done its easy to say that one could wait a bit and get out on the resume.. but i only do that when i don't get a mac against confirm. so perfectly done there. but (for learning purposes) lets say the mac bar against would have occurred one candle later.. i would have had my sl set bellow that one and would have exited for much less loss or a BE on the resume back.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
patiently wait for each signal to really separate from the band.. you want to see a gap kind of a loop before making it a valid signal.. for eg.. today signals.. ej and gu where much more clear signal with solid gap between then let's say the EU.. .. and gj atm is not looking to what we want.. there is no gap. just some live stuff to help you all to understand better.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
FXE why are you exposing trades, what do you expect to gain ?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
hi FXE .. just curious .. any specific reason why only eu.ej.gu.gj pairs ? was doing a trial by using it on usdchf just now and i am up +12pips... cheers.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
because average daily range on these pairs are around 100+ consistently.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
for better and clear learning purposes especially the flexible exit strategy. if it really bothers you all i could remove the explorer!!.. i can care or less.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
you misunderstood. I will start something similar with explorer as well. it is really cool as one does not have to document trades. Can match trade list with comments for full replay. like your signal generators. I was thinking to use 10 sma but dont like paying premium for momentum.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
what will be the setting for MACD M1 ? macd 6,14,0 ??? or else ?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
don't know, i don't trade m1.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
EU being a bitch today

--- 帖子 #40 ---
folks, before you get on my case.. this last trade on eu was a total accident as i traded the wrong account at much higher lot size designed for this account.. lucky i was able to get out of it for not too big of a loss but big enough for this account.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
who can tell me between the 4pairs under our watch which ones offer signal potential?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hello all - I am a scalper also. I am hoping to learn more from this thread.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
FXEmpire, this is kind of the scenario I was talking about. It happened Friday, the last trading day, but I think it would be similar any time there's a strong move. Will you take a look at the chart and let me know if there's something i'm not doing correctly? thanks.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
sure... what your not doing is reading my 1st post clearly.. please read the entry and art of the work section where i talk about manual slick exit. your 1st and 4th entries are invalid and you did not take into account last winning entry couple of hours past nys. if I would have suggested to trade off some manual sort of robotic way then it would have look like what you have shown.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
ok. thanks for the quick reply. i think i understand your logic a lot better. you're more or less waiting for OBOS retracements in an area where they're likely to occur and bailing at the earliest sign of possible trend continuation, is that right? It seems pretty sound. i had some confusion on what you meant by outside bands. the 1st and 4th trades you said were invalid both close outside the bands, but they pierced the band, so you're saying to be outside the band they don't even touch it? And i didn't pick up that last trade b/c i hadn't seen the trade before it had already hit a SL. i've updated the chart to reflect these. thanks again for your help.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
ob/os do not necessarily happen on only the pullbacks, it happens during any market condition. I would look to bail out on the earliest sign of trouble during (again) any condition. on entries, you want clear price separation from band to exhaustion of price with gap/loop in between for more reliable entries maybe. and do not forget the 3.3pips buffer + spread and a scalper knows better to choose ecn broker with low spread. The real key are, on defensive side.. the section about slick exit, which turns a -15's to BE or under -5 loss.. and on offensive side, ones real job is to capitalize when price reaches the target zone area before 1st sign of trouble comes in and not fall into illusion of making more pips or catch a runner every time.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
gj ej and eu are well extended beyond band and good for potential setup.. looking to take shot at..

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi mates, my msg is primarily for newbies or losing traders: if you gonna scalp against trend with 50 pips SL using TMA&amp;MACD and entering at the break of counter trend candle high / low you will blow your account in no time. My sincere advice to the thread author: please save you money and find other method to scalp. This one is the sure way to lose. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks for your useless input no offense, and people are free to listen to your suggestion. However, please take the time to read the 1st post in full and understand before making suggestions, as the main point of success i suggested is pointed to risk control. If to trade like a robot like most people like you do, then it's true.. by letting the 50 pips sl to be hit like a ding dung, purpose of 50 pips sl is to be away from the heat in the early stages of the trade to see if its going to find it way to profit target and if not sl will be tighten with slick exit on top of it to get way free from a chance given for profitability. there is no trend in 5m, it's noise. if your looking for trend in 5m to scalp, then you way off friend. I knew people like you would come out and say stuff like this and there will be more i am sure.. that is why i purposely set a small size explorer with risking around 7% to show that if one develops the necessary skill it is highly possible to be super profitable even with such higher risk scenario. on larger account with 2% risk for a skillful trader this will be walk in the park day in day out.. i done it for years and time will tell as i make progress in this account. it's all good, I expected that most people would not understand it. Trading is not for everyone.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi! I will try you system, but during NY market! lets see!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
you sound like your doing me a favor.. lol.. just kidding. Welcome to the thread

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hahaha! not at all! I am just looking a way to fine tune my entries on lower timeframes!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
well, I am obligated to tell you that if your looking for better or high accurate entry then this won't do it.. the focus in here as a key for success is what you do beyond the trigger based on a casual entry. i only say this so you and others know what they should look for in this thread.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I find scalps work better in direction of trend/bias when there is one. So I take only one direction that I identified as bias. I am out if no bias detected. It is just waste of time. Do you have filter like that in your repertoar ?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
i sum it up for you in one sentence.. in small frame scalping, too much filtering does more harm than good. in small frame there is no such thing as trend.. you will have more of everything else than trend in overall market anyways, more so in small frame .. so by filtering you will only eliminated yourself from more opportunities. mean time its only logical to end up with losing triggers, but in reverse it will also get you in more chances for profit. risk control is what your filtering is in scalping.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Did you guys know you be way better off not worshiping the "Trend" so much.. even though its put so much stress and insists on it from all. just something to think about..

--- 帖子 #57 ---
FxEmpire Is the minus 40% trade explorer a reflection of the method you are trading here or is just an account with random trades?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Its all this method.. i use higher risk than normal on this small account purposely and unfortunately have not been able to trade full time last couple of days as a result have missed some good winners.. its not a problem it will be up in no time.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
It is not trend as per popular belief, above xxx MA or similar. This has no value. It is knowing with considerably more than 50% probability where market will move next over several days. For example I am only shorting aud since last wednesday. Longing it would not produce any reasonable winner in that period. My hope is that in this way one can extract more pl if correct for given level of risk than engaging swing trade with larger stop. If I have no directional signal, do not trade, as skill to make money without extra info is beyond my level.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
what your saying could be true for long term trading.. but for scalping is meaningless. just a thought.. market trends only about 30% of the times at best.. rest of the time does everything else.. now go figure.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
50 pips sl on 1min TF...you got to be kidding me ....stay away..

--- 帖子 #62 ---
lol.. plz do stay away, good god.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
THis is very interesting strategy. I got +24+24+21+20=89 pips total. Entered on the pink vertical lines as per the rule by FXEmpire. My exit was on the opposite TMA band.No stoploss.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
oh my goushhhh, did you say no stop loss!!.. you will get crucified.. lol well done.. nice ping pong action.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
some real good opportunities today i thought to post charts and explanations for you.. I got involved on 3 of the 4 good signals but banked good enough on two and bailed early on the gu bcz i had to run out. now checked out.. all these trades at the time of trigger were look like they are trending.. but as you see now they have turned like a none trending pair.. so now after the fact, you would look at the eu trade which is not a winner and say this one was inside a trend and i should look for a way to filter this one out.. lol.. you get my point!!.. the fact is if you try to filter that one then your should have no business to take action on other ones which are winners. so to make it short and to the point.. the best filter for scalping is your skill and ability post trigger to identify the loser quick and cut them short.. sure sometimes you will be late or PA might turn on you a bit quicker for bigger loss but still will be out weights by your winners and the extra chances you have given yourself to be in more action and more chances of profit. now, you might say, what if all or most of my trades turn as a fake out.. ok, its a solid concern.. but the game of trading is the game of probabilities... think about what you got at hand, and ask yourself how often price is trending and how often not?.. its safe to say it trends less than half the time at best and the other half and more is in none trending mood.. and when it is trending it does not move in straight action.. it retraces.. so you got that also working for to either make your profit on larger retrace or on medium retraces to control the risk according to my exit strategy rules (eu as a example with a loss under 5pips) for lesser loss or a BE result. there is more i can talk about this stuff but maybe another time if it requires or you all are interested.i thought to share this as a eye opener for the ones who are interested in this thread to know the details and philosophy behind it.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Live counter trade on eu..

--- 帖子 #67 ---
quick 10 pips out on 1st initial sign of trouble taking into account that maybe eu's "trend" is a bit strong.. but look.. its safe to say this counter trade was on the full strength of eu 5m trend in the eyes of many.. but with well predefined planing you can easily control the risk. this was live display for your confidence.. ps) but hey look what happen to me when i put too much weight on "Trend".. lol

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi , My name is Kelly , want to post my trades for today to share out to this thread . I have read the strategy and see whether i done it correctly.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Kelly.. just checkout your trades.. your entries are fine.. but on the risk control part, your sl on the first trade is a bit wide as you should not lose no more than 12 pips give or take on this one ( you may have a large spread, which could be the cause).. but to be sure you will need to set your sl 3.3 pips right below the against mac/candle spot. about double down.. no comment, only to say be careful.. its personal and not advised in this thread by me. overall you did well.. be happy to see more of your live trades. ps) I advise to not scalp with large spreads .. use ecn broker with very small spread/commission combo. for example my spread on eu is a floating which averages around less than .5 pips on pairs like gbp/jpy is about avg 1.5 pips where in most regular brokers the spread on this pair is 5-8 pips. anything above 1-2 spread is too much and effects the mechanic of the work.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi FXE, Thanks for your advice . Will be careful on my SL , Yes , u r rite about my spread . I be planning to use ECN broker , on the other part will practice more on demo . Will post my trades more to share . Thanks .

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Only the first entry on your screenshot is per the rule by FXEmpire. Entry 2,3 and 4 closed inside the TMA. On post#1, the Entry rule says Maybe my understanding is wrong because english is not my native language ? I wonder why FXEmpire said FXEmpire, would you mind to clarify the Entry rules ? Or is there a new rule which says: You can enter inside the TMA bands if your gut feeling is telling you to do it ?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
fxtr.. my entry rule is what i have mentioned in my 1st post and does not change.. you would hardly see me take action on "just a reaction to the band".. i like to see Price extend beyond it before taking a shot at. gut feel or playing ping pong are also valid and praise-able if one can consistently make money however not within the rules of my thread but sort of close to the strategy we use here.. so based on above, I say "well done". .. and your English if fine mate, go barcaaaaa..

--- 帖子 #73 ---
great to have you around..

--- 帖子 #74 ---
today's action created some really solid setup all around which most turned to be winners. GU was the best pair out of the four, just short of awesome.. i thought to post it for you. and please don't think i only like to show winners as i think the losers will help you a lot more as to how to control the risk better.. but simply today there were no significant loser.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks for clarification. Everybody can do what he likes to do, sometimes it is great to trade reversals at the center line of TMA True, sometimes in a consolidation area it is great to trade from upper band to lower band and vice versa like playing ping pong. Just wanted to make sure I understood your rules correctly.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
already busy trading involved on two trades getting the blood pumping early in the day.. lol i want to show you guys a example of slick exit which happened live now on my ej trade.. as a major section for risk contol and big difference maker in the bottomline at end of the week, month. I get the picture ready and post it in a few.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
ok watch the chart.. short valid counter trade on ej.. tuned out to be a fo as the opposite candle bar against arrived as i have marked.. quickly sl with 3.3 pips buffer sets.. now safe to say that sl is over 7pips and around 12 pips to be exact.. so we go after slick exit before sl take out.. the two red candle's are your resume back.. at this point you must ignore everything that comes to your head but your plan of exit.. raiser sharp to exit for lesser damage and preferably a BE exit.. which in this case could be easily done. so first comes the HEAT (the against candle).. then comes your stone cold action for exit (the resume back). must recognize it quick and act on it and nothing in between what so ever. What you don't want to do at this point is to fall into illusion and hope that resume back to continue in your favor and reach your target.. you make that exit by sticking to your plan ... .. ladies and gentleman this is called scalping with full control.. don't give rats ass about what happens afterward even if runs to the moon.. your job is to execute the plan to the best of your ability and the pips will come. there is plenty of opportunities especially for one who scalps. I hope it serves well. by the way i am long on gu atm..

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hello FXEmpire, Thanks for sharing your system. In this image there were other setups that you didn't take. Can you please explain why? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #79 ---
bcz of working time..

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hello FXEmpire I do find your trading idea interesting. But especially when trading countertrend demands a disciplined MM. Your 325:1 leverage and floating loss of 44% in a single trade is suicide. When this Trade Explorer acount (for demonstration purpose, I know) is vanished, try again with a max leverage of 10:1 I do hope your thread survives Best wishes finnsol

--- 帖子 #81 ---
i can't find the template of this method, is there anyone can help me ? BTW, TIA.

Hi kelly, is your trend strength measurment indicator a reliable one? however can you post for me to check it out plz. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thank you for helping people with the template.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
folks i finally got around to it and added the template to post one. You will need to also load all the indies in order for the template to look right.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
finnsol.. you are correct. but you are not correct about vanished account.. .. i mean I'll try,lol.. I like the challenge.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
just something to show you all.. two back to back chart activity from GU as a most active pair the last two days.. two charts, but very different display of action and results, and guess what, I love'em both.. why?.. just look at the charts.. and see how a good day can well out weight the bad day.. one, up and down which is good for counter trade days, and the other, trendish where its not so good for the counter trade days.. The point is even on super trendish as it was on gu still you can survive it with risk control instead of culturing your mind with various ways of filtering techniques. Do not think for a second, that you can filter today's losses and still capture yesterdays winners, or today retrace at the end of the run. if market or your tf is not trending then whatever else is doing its good for countering.. if it is trending, still fine bcz it retraces and you can get your fair and share.. if it fakes you on tiny retraces just to get you in and fake you out, you can cut it short control it and live with part of the losses that any system has in it. I hope it serves well for open minded.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi FXE, I just use it for 2 months , but based on what i know is that when trending , any currency above 70% and stay there for sometime , its best dont counter it .

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks kelly. I take look at it.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
couple of trades early on as the only two opportunities so far.. started out nicely to about 8 pips profit each then a sharp turn around.. risked controlled with first bar/candle against for minimal loss. moving on..

--- 帖子 #94 ---
This is how it works Attached Image

--- 帖子 #95 ---
banked 16 on this one.. and there was a solid buy opportunity as well which i missed, good for easy 15.. same buy signal on ej as well.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
nice job.. however a bit reckless on the entry and not according to the rule, nevertheless great trade.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
how long, or how many trades, did it take you to exit worst drawdown in your scalping career ?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
a lot of things depends to answer this question. I been on some DD's for various reason none technical or skill wise and still dug-ed out of it. The number one reason for a scalper to fall into DD is to not be trading full time to be there for opportunities, which leads to disruption. But for something structural that your perhaps asking is.. lets say trading full time and due to market lack of volatility/strength or simply I stick it up for whatever reason to hit 20-30% W in a week.. then normally with a solid 50-60% hit the following week will recover and more due to slight better avg win then avg loss. so time wise is no more than a week. Number of trade wise, i should be averaging about 50 trades a week at least, so hitting 30 winners will get me back and plus. ..Not to sound arrogant or anything.. but when i trade full force and hitting my minimum weekly trade number.. I do not lose, much as less to fall in DD. I hope my answer satisfies you.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
thanks for the answer. I just started and like to get some feel what is ahead of me. Hoping to produce 3 trades a day on average. Do you think 100 trades is enough to gauge whether particular scalping method has an edge ?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
thanks FXEmpire.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
[quote=kellypero;6685501] i have added it but do not know why the screen appears like that. but, thanks for your care.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I must warn you when you ask me questions, lol.. bcz i got my own out of the box refreshing (some say) crazy ideas.. so what i say is based on my own belief and experiences which has brought ME success and may not make single sense to you and one should reanalyze everything one sees and hears to come up with owns conclusion. so with that said.. i say, if your looking for edge in scalping then your edge would be only YOU.. a skillful one can produce even with a mediocre method bcz more than anything its a game of skill when it comes to scalping. whats important is your belief in what pathway you choose to follow.. and not so much the methods back test or technical structure. I do not believe a method can make a scalper successful but rather a scalper making one to fit for oneself to follow with strict discipline and NO betrayal to the rules. so if you follow or forward test a method based on what i said above could give you the edge by reevaluating your actions in it as a sole captain at the end.

Fxempire, I just wanted to pop-up and say I think your giving good advice with a good system... Thank-you for helping people and sharing your knowledge snarlyjack

Thank you. regards,

I trade the same concept using different filters. I prefer waiting until trend flattens (bands move sideways). I find that this improves accuracy and lowers stress/anxiety. Using a pair that is not known for trending, such as EG, is also worth considering.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi FXEmpire A very solid, risk controlled method you have presented here. Most of the ppl tend to avoid discussion about risk thinking that there is no need for that as long as they get high win % ratio, also why talking about risk and losses while we could talk about those sweet profits and filters and other illusions. I would like to ask you few questions as Im really interested to participate in this thread. 1. Why 3.3 pips buffer - you just like the number or from experience? 2. For how long you leave your pending order? Do you wait 2,3,4 candles and then remove it of not triggered? 3. Do you trade every signal on all of four pairs? Eg. If you have valid EU and EJ signals roughly at the same time, would you take both of them or waited for the first one to played out. Or maybe you only take one trade at the time? 4. Please do, it would be really good to follow your thought process. I have more questions but don't want to push it. Regards

--- 帖子 #107 ---
-about 3.3 pips.. i never do anything in trading just bcz i like it.. lol.. the reason for 3.3 buffer is to get trigger from the break out point that your looking for with a distance of at least 3pips, normally a breakout counts as a breakout with minimum of 2-3 pips break.. i added a .3 to make sure it surpasses the full 3 pips. -I leave pending orders depending on mac/bar situation.. order will be modified with new favorable entry point or canceled when completely and firmly runs against which you would witness multiple of consecutive mac bar/candle against. - It is a must to try to trade all the signals.. one's success is heavily dependent on how active you can be in signal department. for eg, last week there was a total of about 60 signals and I only got involved on 30 of them and you can see my result, instead of making about 400 pips i lost about 70.. big difference. you could get lucky and with less activity end up with more of the winners but has never happened to me through out the years.. so make your own luck. -I treat each signal on each pair as a sole.. so i trade them both and all. in short tf they all move differently even though they may look correlated.. and sure i could have 4 trades at the same time. your participation are more than welcome here.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
just a quick simple counter scalp on ej good for 15 pips as i spiked the early part of London due to bank holidays.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi FXEmpire Thanks for your reply. I have taken the same trade and got 14pips, but I also have taken a signal about 5 bars before, which I have closed for -3 pips (it was slick exit - red macd against me and SL around 10). Any reason you didn't take it? Also, with slick exit you mentioned BE zone - how do you judge when to exit. Are you happy with 5 pips loss and as soon as you get it you close a trade. Its probably a second nature for you now, but I would like to know you thinking process, especially when we are in trouble. Regards

--- 帖子 #110 ---
No particular reason other than not being in front of my system.. the signal you took is a valid one and i would have taken it and most likely exited with the same result as you. .. about slick exit.. I am going to try to give one more detail mental picture on this.. for those who are interested would be a good idea to make this a sticky note. ok look.. the idea is to get away from a already loss position.. meaning, when i see a candle/bar mac against come at me and forced to set a SL larger than -7/-10, at this point this trade is a loss to me and my only hope is for PA to give me a small chance to limit the loss before sl is taken out... so.. as soon as SL is set, THE IMMEDIATE or 1ST resume back till its weakening, I ride it.. now this can last although way back to BE point or -5 zone or less or more.. so, as soon as i see the resume is losing steam and it's speed and rhythm is changing for worse , I make the exit, period. most likely a -15 with slightest resume back gets cut to half, which is great.. if lucky enough it could get cut more or arrive at BE. Now, all this happens quick in a small area, where you should be watching every tick of it, to feel the measure of its rhythm in order to make the best exit decision. This is as good and honest as a detail as i probably could give in words for your understanding.. action speaks louder, close attention to the explorer would help and nothing beats repetition, seeing it and doing it many many times. I hope this helps. by the way i will be trading full force tomorrow and most of this week to try my best to capture most if not all the signals, so being here and active with me would help you greatly.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Ready to make some solid trades today.. scalpers mind set daily approach: "Battle is won, before it even starts."

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi FXEmpire have tried a few trades with your method and had a fair bit of success. have also subscribed thanks evo9

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi FXEmpire I have question about 50 SL as the emergency stop. Im sure there was a time (probably more than once) when price went straight against your entry and kept going and going. Would you kill the trade let say after 20-30 pips, or let it run and then try to slick exit. Also I assume you risk x% per trade, but do you calculate risk based on 50 pips sl (where TP would be 50pips as well for RR=1:1) or you calculate your risk based on average SL you get (around 15-20pips)? Regadrds

--- 帖子 #114 ---
good questions.. I do not make a exit in the middle of a candle bar against, no matter what, i wait for it to close then set the sl and if it gives me a chance i slick exited. sure there been times where i can get hit with a quick -30 and plus loss.. but i must say that usualy happens at the news which one should be aware of up coming event and stay alert. I calculate my risk based on my avg loss.. which mine is about 10 or under but to be safe I calculate it at 15, conservatively one can consider 20. 50 pips SL exist only for emergency purposes out of the heat of the battle to survive the shadows and silly moves against with follow up resume.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Good morning FX Empire, I hope you are well. This thread/system caught my eye mainly due to the fact that this system is quite similar to a system I use for counter-trade scalps, however I use different indi's and different bands (bollinger bands) for my entries. I appreciate the fact that you have started your own thread to share your system with other traders. I can only imagine how frustrating that must be at times. People asking the same questions etc, and more recently, people posting their own systems on a thread made specifically to trade and discuss yours lol. I look forward to building a chart the way you have instructed and seeing what kind of results it produces. Will share my results once I have gathered some. Once again, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
YW and thanks for the kind words. I don't mind good questions and once i see its repeated question i would just refer them to the post where i explained it. but the other thing has no place here, but no frustration just simply will ignore and have the monitor to remove the irrelevant posts. he might just have not read the 1st post and thought its ok.. i always look at the good and positive sides and believe he is a good citizen but just mis-steped. its all good.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I understand. Ok, well I'm sure I may have a question or two once I have built my charts to the specifiactions of this system. I will monitor this thread closely and watch for trade setups you take. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
as a chart observer to see the early alert for your possible signal especially a scalper and what we do here.. the first sign is.. when we see price strikes out of the band. ..atm we got dollar making a move out side.. so prepared pairs are, eu, gu and gj.. so staying alert, watching the mac bar to go narrow and close as narrow.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
cool.. I have a template placed in the first post if it helps.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
live action on eu.... risked reduced after 1st sign of trouble.. ans sl is at 8.4 pips.. so its reasonable risk within my avg loss.. i would let this one play out for a little more time to see if it resumes towards target. if for example sl size would have been -12 or -15 i would be looking to slick exited on the first chance pa gives me.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Very good trade FX Empire. Impressive that the first trade I monitor live is the best part of 20 pips... I have loaded the EU and studying intently. I will load up the other 4 so please continue to post any real time trades so I can further understand the entries and get more in sync with what I need to be seeing in order for the good setups. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
just got the candle/bar against.. sl set as you see is -13, too much.. i look to slick exited on the 1st chance before it takes out my sl.. no matter what this position is dead to me.. i just look to survive it. thats it

--- 帖子 #123 ---
and out for -2.. turned a -13 possible and more likely loss to -2. the trade was given enough time and chance to deliver.. will it or not now it don't matter.. it did not when i wanted. took a chance did not work out but walked away with not much loss not much harm. moving on to the next deal.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
if and i hope your following closely... you just witnessed me slick exit out the gu and a the same time entered the GJ.. at this time.. you should never ever think correlation.. meaning, thinking to yourself: "ok i let the gu to live on instead out exiting since the gj is making a up move.. " or.. "exit the gu and delete the buy order for the gj." each pair should be treated as a sole and separately in the short frame at least for a scalper. i just dropped you all some key stuff the last hour or so with 2 live trades. it takes energy and time from me as i manage my account.. i am multi task kind of a person but i can't do this all the time.. i might do a few more and you should try to capture it on the fly if this is your thing.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
FXE, My MACDhist looks different to yours in as far as I have both bullish and bearish, bold and narrow mac bars both sides of the 0 line. Whereas I can see from your screenshots that you only have bullish bold and narrow mac bars above the 0 line, and vice versa. It may seem irrelevant, but thought Id mention it.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
and a losing trade.. gj took me out before giving any chance to perform a slick out.. lol.. it all good as long as you control the risk precisely and massively.. its the name of the game. couple timely and close to action picture to feel the essence. look at the 3rd picture... oh yes..

--- 帖子 #127 ---
you can play around with the colors.. as long as you get narrow and bold on time that all matters.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I got out with -6. just as I closed it went to -3. But like you said it doesn't matter, it was a loser anyway. Im both long EU and GU. Regards PS:GU closed for -4.2

Hi FXempire, i have a question regarding TMA True, do you know what are the values after the 3 lines (upper, mid,bottom) ?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Closed trade ..E/U +21 pips , A/U +10 pips.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Nice going Kelly, I didn't get up in time for that one on the EU

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks The Sparrow , I just got back from work , saw the setup trade , went in, was monitoring it , as MACD changed red color , set SL 4 pips under the bar of the red MACD .

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Great work FXE, will learn this .

--- 帖子 #137 ---
666.. i don't understand your question, what value are you talking about.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Attached Image After the 3 tma lines you have values and i wanted to know for what these values are. 5.6 - 1.5 - 2.5 in my example.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hello Kelly, Well done with those trades. Just a quick observation/question. The narrow mac candle on both your entries that enabled you to take the trade turned good for you one bar earlier than they did on my MT4. So I wouldnt have been able to enter the trade until the bar after you... Not a massive problem in itself. However, this could potentially be the difference between me having a valid entry, or not. Any ideas why this is? I have the same settings laid out in the earlier posts. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi FXEmpire How long do you wait to slick exit? For example: Have you ever waited more than 15 or more minnutes for slick exit if price floats around -8 and -14? Hope that makes sense. Also are there any reasons for you not to trade after London close (apart for having life)? Regards

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Freshpips, I have the same signal on MACD as you do. that would be one bar later then kellys. checked my setting and they aok. I'm using usa broker MBTrading, maybe thats the difference? CHANGED Macd to 5:14:0 and that worked, but I don't know if thats the proper way to deal with this issue?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Cheers for the reply Sparrow, Fari enough. Just wanted to check if anyone one else had encountered this. I trade through Alpari. I think we get the same setups as FXEmpire and it obviously works for him so I'm to assume its not a problem. EDIT: Thats good to know it can be done, but if we are learning a specific system I think its best to stick to the setting laid out, at least in the early stages. After thats been perfected, then experimenting with the settings is fine. I will be keeping mine as FXEmpire has advised for now.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
oh ok.. they are the distance of each line from the current price. its nothing important for the method.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
please read the post i made about this late yesterday.. you can not put time around this.. it's more to watch the rhythm of each tick on the resume back.. when it loses steam you want to make your exit.. now this could last longer or shorter in time.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thanks for your answer. Just wanted to make sure i have got this right. Regards PS: Im long GU 1.5128 PSS: GU close for 16 pips

--- 帖子 #146 ---
thanks. kelly i have kept a close eye on the currency strength indi and i think it could help in some ways. overall it's not a bad tool. there are many tools as such available, depends on the user comfort with one. we could maybe use this here to give people a structure to go by. .. if there is interest i could maybe see how i could put it in words to make better use of it.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
HI Freshpips, I check with the chart , yes its different , coz of the TMA , i use 56 , 2.0 , 100 for EU , AU , GU , UJ , as per FXE 1st post stated , the one we download at the 1st post is default 56 , 3.0 ,100 , ( i use for EJ and GJ )

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I'm not sure that i want to follow your method when i look your explorer, mine is better(for the moment).

--- 帖子 #149 ---
FXempire thanks for providing a v good scalping strategy, however i have one question tht most of the time trend is strong n price doesnt revert back after crossing the upper or lower TMA lines. Can u explain how can we minimize damage in such case or does not enter trade , somehow identify strong trend beforehand and avoid such trades ? It wil help in minimizing the losses n filter some bad entries. Will appreciate if you can guide on wht to do in such situation. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
good i wont hold my breath.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
if i could solve the problem highlighted in the red I would have been a billionaire by now.. the point is, it's hard and impossible somewhat to gauge the strength and weakening of the trend base on consistent matter so it could count as reliable.. so all you can do is to still take your shots and control the risk, you are better off doing this. but its hard and not for everyone. .................. please everyone.. forget filtering ideas.. at least in this thread.. instead of pressuring your brains to come up with all kinds of filtering ideas but rather force your brain to learn "risk control" master that skill.. It will solve your problems better, but one needs to be tough to handle the rough.. perhaps days like this is a good example of tough. and remember, only about half the time at best market trends, so none trending days would payoff greatly. look at things for a long haul. i promise you guys at end of this day (which is not a great day) still you would end up with satisfying result considering the amount of signals and trendish PA, we would calculate them together or each of you post yours.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
hi i am not a scalper thank you

--- 帖子 #153 ---
thanks FXEmpire, i understand your point, actually the problem with most us including myself is tht we want every trade to be successful and get panic when there are short loses eventually making more mistakes, and certainly we dont look at bigger picture... i hope i can master this part and be successful... will trade live on ur strategy n post results. thanks again.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
i was wondering why no one said that before

--- 帖子 #155 ---
For me it looks like a loosing method.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
i agree. At least it is what the trade explores shows.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Well I think its better to start badly and prove that thru discipline you can recover, than start beautifully and with the first sigh of DD start wondering if method is still working or maybe some filtering is required. Regards

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I think if his strategy needs filtering it does mean that he doesn't master his strategy. I have a few working strategies, here's an example based on true tma : Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #159 ---
It is said in the opening post that this method doesn't need filtering, and I agree with it. This is scalping, you need to control risk to the max. If the trade goes in your favor it goes right away-ish, but when its a fake we need to get out with the minimum loss. Simple as that. Regards

--- 帖子 #160 ---
todays results between four pairs of all possible signals, with consideration of level of action involvement on a brutal day as some of you may call. notice that I have counted the positive pips very conservative. by the way this is not to prove anything.. but maybe just a confidence builder for interested followers as how a brutal day could look like. end result after 17 possible signals with 5 wins and 5 losses and 7 BE = +21.. now let's count -3 pips for each of the BE's in case if you did not slick exit as best as possible, results = Breakeven.. on a bad day. and we know that market trends only about half the time at best and we know that when it don't trend the chances of making money on counter plays is very high and overall good or better days score big, a single pair could easily bring home over 40 pips. anyways here is the results.. if you have questions or concern about my results for today in explorer.. well, its simple.. as always for ones success or failure in this style, it comes down to level of involvement.. i was involved on only 7 of the 17 possible signals.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
who said it needs filtering??.. it don't need filtering and thats what i been stressing. and for you to know: keep your stuff out of here, ok sport. I guess you can keep trading that young demo account.. and let your scalp to last over 9 hrs to over come massive DD. anyhow i hope you are profitable and all your strategies are working greatly for you and would not need to lurk around still, and to open your own thread to talk about them.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
The problem is that i still couldn't understand how your strategy could be profitable.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
you don't need to.. you got your own profitable system working for you and thats all you need, and it's not my problem your incompetency, with no offense. I would highly recommend for you to stay out of this thread and concentrate on your own stuff.

nice job kelly.. i got some too.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
it's nice to get on some easy rides at times.. I was waiting for such break, as this explorer account needed a push, so now i can really work it. eu exit timing was a bit off but still banked way more than the usual stuff. but GU was just perfect out. both could still run for more, but to time the first burst exit this was all good.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
The way I see it: You have 2 choices You can sit back, relax, try and learn what is being taught. Asked positive questions regarding this method. Maybe find that little golden nugget that gets you to the next level in YOUR trading. Or Go home and play in your own sand box. It appears you think your method is better. Post#148. Well then go trade it. But I really do not think it is.. Why? You’re here !! You are your own worst enemy. You are definitely have trouble getting out of your own way. You have heard the term “ trading is 90% mental and 10% method “ You might want to consider another endeavor as trading, based on your attitude, is not suited for you. TSD

Do you think the voucher i've came alone ? At the begginning i came here just to know what were the numbers after the tma. Today i wasn't at home so i couldn't trade, but this was possible : Attached Image (click to enlarge) And congrats to FXempire for the nice trades he made.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thank you. 666, if you don't mind i really appreciate if you do not post irrelevant stuff in my thread. I really do not like to repeat this to you or anyone again. thx in advance

Yes in the future i will not post irrelevant stuff.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi FXEmpire Nice trades, unfortunately I was able to trade all signal but those 2 big winners- so Im on negative a bit. That brings my question. Do you try to trade the whole week regardless of achieved results, or do you stop when you reach x pips or x%. Of course one never know what next day brings, just want to know what is your view on this, based on your experience with this method. Regards

--- 帖子 #178 ---
rew.. this is something that each trader should figure out for it's own, bcz only YOU know your loss/risk etc, tolerance.. only YOU know the size of your account and financial situation. What I do may not be suitable for you or vise versa. with that said.. I will give you a overall picture. firstly one needs to be fully aware of his plan of trading, it's potential, strengths and weaknesses.. in this plan you should know how many trades a week it produces in order to measure the potential and then you will know its fullest strength and then to figure out how to survive the weakness with you as the captain of the ship. for eg. X amount of trades at X amount of avg loss and your X amount of account size to figure out the risk tolerance or such and such length of time.. how to best to survive a bad day week, quarter. I like for everyone to figure out the "X amounts" on their own bcz it depends on individuals dedication, screen time, level of developed skill and scheduled of work and etc,. however since it's important i will give you all some figures. full time trader, one who trades the whole London session and takes 90% if not all the signals and one who had got a grasp of this style of scalping.. should be trading about 10 trades a day or about 50 a week, give or take.. avg loss about 10 pips and avg win about 15+.. so now with these numbers one should figure out the rest and find owns pathway. I recommend for newbies of this thread to risk very small do not exceed 2% risk per trade based on -15 pips sl.. and try your hardest to increase your level of involvement.. meaning taking up on each valid signals between the four pairs and practice the hell out of the "art of the work" section.. enter and trade manage accordingly.. once you find comfort then you could make better measurement about everything else, with knowing your own strength and skill mixed with measured potential of the method. remember, system or method or etc, is only half the battle, at best, when it comes to Scalping especially.. rest is YOU.. your skill, your mental preparation and toughness. I hope i have not left out anything, it a bit early for me without full cup of coffee yet, lol.. anyhow it should clear away some for you and everyone else.

Hi , Today's trade in order , GJ = enter at 153.07

--- 帖子 #181 ---
classic example for why no filter.. as you see two trades.. at the time of trigger of each PA is trending very strongly.. at our signal time it seems that this strong trend is ending.. so we take the trade.. if you filter trade 1, bcz you do not want to go against trend, then your filtering philosophy must stand for trade 2 to be filter as well. .. now if you filter both, which it means you would never go against trend.. then you might as well not be trading counters at all. if you argue that I would trade counters but not against "strong" trend and only against "weaker" trend.. this where you open a can worm for yourself.. which will opens you up to all kinds of analysis, need for various of indicators for measurements and etc, which normally will lead to second guessing and total disruption of clean trading. so this is one live example as why i say you will not need filter, as the best filtering is to stick to risk control by cutting losses short at same time being super active to not miss the next trade and the next one and set your sight on the long run results. anyhow that's what i have done for years. by the way i was involved on the 1st trade on both gu and ej and lost about 25 on each. I saw the trend too strong i thought it be a good idea to take time for breakfast, and boommmm lost the wining counter. same kind of deal on gj.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi FXE Thank you for your answer. Have you ever consider extending trading hours, when you had no time to trade during London session (ex. you missed half of a session or few hrs at the beginning etc)? PS: Short EU @ 1.2860 Regards

--- 帖子 #183 ---
sure one could go although way to end of u.s session.. but i don't like to go beyond the overlap time unless i see a really alive market, like yesterday as a example, there was room for a few more solid trades for positive outcome. I am short on eu as well.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Currently short EU 1.2861

--- 帖子 #185 ---
why the use of mac?... look at the chart the shades part and figure it out. mac will give you extra patience as to not fall too quick or too late for shadows or serious move against.. it helps with your emotions enveloped too much or at least with some discipline.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Stopped out -15

--- 帖子 #187 ---
did you get stopped out or you slicked out? bcz stopped out should be around -23 pips.. anyways that's what i got.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hello FXE, My actual stop was bigger but didnt like the way PA was behaving so manually closed trade. Although EU looking like it wants to test slightly higher, maybe 1.29, then could be setting itself up for another fall IMO.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I was out at -24

--- 帖子 #190 ---
some chart picture on today's action.. a bit tough and rough which can't expect otherwise from market. If all trades were taken and dealt with according to plan of trading or even close to it, you should be up about 60 pips or at worst breakeven. (the small red lines is the close of bar/candle against where SL should be set with buffer and spread, which allows you some room for possible slick out exit) the reason i show these charts is to stress the importance of the level of involvement for ones success. your level of involvement and risk control will over come anything. The opportunities will come, BUT, we got to be there, to be in it and not watching it.. slacking out or cherry picking will not do it.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Well done FX, some great trades there. Question - Was there a reason you chose not to take the trade on EJ long, 2 bars previous to your first +40 pip trade this morning?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
2bars before was a valid setup and pending order would be place, but then the following bar is a bearish one which order does not fill and we get a bold bar against which now we should look for the narrow and that brings us to where i got triggered.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Fair enough, makes sense. Do you always set pending orders or do you also enter manually? What I mean is do you always set the pending with your 3.3 pip buffer once you have seen the first narrow mac bar alerting you to a potential setup? Or do you also enter manually with your 3.3 pip buffer (once high/low of signal bar is taken out by 3.3 pips)?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
HI everybody, Empire thank you for your teaching, great thread. I have a question on Kellys Currency Power indi, It loads fine on my demo account with fxfin but not with live ecn account with mbtrading, any suggestions? If not its ,no big deal I'm NOT dependent on it. thanks. again great thread Empire.

Thanks for kind words Sparrow. about CP indi of kelly.. it worked fine for me on my ecn account when i wanted to check it out, so I don't know why it does not work on yours. I am glad that you are not dependent on it.. not to take away anything from the indi but it's crutch and which will lead to missing on good opportunities IMHO. however the best way to use it is not looking at how high or low the currency is trending but rather how neutral are they and take chances only on those currencies which will lead to missing some good signals still.. it just reduces the amount of signals and slight better win rate which it does not necessarily means more positivity. for example looking at eu pair.. if euro is trending +80 most likely usd is trending under 20.. to counter you would have to buy the dollar which is slumping and you be against the trend.. so its a no go. but lets say both sides are withing each others range between 40-60%.. then you can only ping point this type of conditions to take action on either way play up and down.. which without the indi that is very much visible anyways but this would be the best way to use it again IMHO.

Thank you , Empire

Hi guys, Was hoping you could clear something up for me. In the attatched screenshot you'll see the 2 shaded purple boxes, with 3 dotted lines through them. The first line was obvioiusly the signal bar with the first close of the counter narrow mac bar signaling a short. My question is, would this have been a trade you would have taken? I know that if it had been a pending order with the 3.3 pip buffer it would not have triggered. However if you had been watching it, then saw that the second narrow mac bar appeared also bearish, would this have made you consider taking the trade or not? Im not one to usually ask this many questions, however I think this is a great strategy and trying to get 100% in sync with it. Thanks in advance. Chart is EU. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank you FxEmpire for this thread. I have been a silent lurker but finally getting a hang of it. Made 3% this am in London session. Awesome stuff. Will be engaged more and will be posting my charts. Peace.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I would have put a stop-sell order under the candle indicated by the first macd thin bar , it failed and i WOULD HAVE CANCELLED THE ORDER on the proceeding fat green bar on the Macd. (if you use stop orders you avoid getting traped in a lot of failed reversals. trade well . Thats my opinon, lets see what Empire says, then we both can learn. Sparrow

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi Freshpips I find that if the TMA bands are in an extreme angle as they are on your chart I always tread gently as momentem seams to be more in the direction of bands

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thanks @ The Sparrow &amp; evolution9. Appreciate your views. Happy Friday and lets all try and end on a positive for the week whilst being aware of a couple of important new releases today... Trade safely.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
3.3 pips buffer stop order is your last confirmation for a real break, so treat it as such. so your stop order stays till you get a opposite bar/candle, then you look for new narrow bar for new entry point. treat the stop order as your last confirmation and try your best to not break this rule, it provides discipline and saves false signals like sparrow mentioned.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thats Great FXE, thanks for clearing that up. To be honest, the more I study this, the better it appears to be. Took a few profitable trades yesterday, the best of which was a very clean trade on EJ for +30. It Hit my TP whilst the actual move completed at more than double. But like you have stated, one needs to be ready exit the bad trades early. This is the single biggest thing that requires discipline. Its very easy to fall for the old mindset of "I'll just let it run a bit longer, I'm sure it will turn..." If its bad and fills the criteria laid out in the exit strategy, then its bad, and get the hell out of there. Once again, thanks for all your Input.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Thanks for kind words and glad to see your activity.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
evo.. all the valid signals of this style of trading is against the angle of TMA that your referring to, which this one does not consider extreme as much as the ej and gj was yesterday and they produced big. anyhow the angle of the tma is meaning less as we do counter trades here and they are supposed to be angling against.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
by the way atm i am load up with stop orders on all four pairs with gj already triggered... so if you like and its wise to pay close attention to the explorer..

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi FXEmpire' After commenting previously i have back tested and have found you to be absolutely correct. Sorry if i have mislead anybody. Thanks FXEmpire for a great method as i'm having a great deal of success with it. Evo.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Great stuff ! Never seen real scalper at work before.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
some nice solid opportunities today with eu as one of the pairs, gj and ej have been awesome again today. I took action on both eu signals but one was taking too long to trigger i had to canceled the order due to running earns, so could not babysit it.. but on the other took full advantage banked 15 large.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Theres been some very impressive setups today... 3 out of 3 for me so far... The US session should bring some more...

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Yesterday trade GJ closed -8 pips, didnt take any trades after that coz went out . Saw some good trades taken from FXE , Great work ! Todays trade , i made some pips from UC + 18 pips . Now just enter buy EU 1.2929 .

--- 帖子 #212 ---
i took the eu as well.. taking a bit too much time decided to exit for -3..

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Wow, why exit ? I took + 18 pips , exit out at 1.2947 .

--- 帖子 #214 ---
here is the first trade as the only opportunity of the day worked out fine for +14. It's national holiday today, can't expect much more. by the way.. i do not pay attention nor get involved with useless conversations, as simple as that. anything out side of the scope of the thread is irrelevant in here.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
YW, i like your signature. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Today is actually the first day of the week as yesterday due to holiday was just simply dead.. only one valid opportunity of us in here. let hope today will set off to a good week.. good luck and skill to all.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
just closed a eu scalp good for +10.. the reason i exited the trade besides low PA strength which on top it lost steam.. but also part of your daily money management as a scalper which plays big role in one's success. early in the day you don't want to push it too much and try to get what you can to build some banks for later baits of the day. its always better to be up front instead of dig your way out of the whole to reach the daily target profit amount. something that i thought to throw at you all in case you did not know always to keep it back of your mind as you go through the day.. as scalper daily management is as vital as your method.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
FXE, thanks for the tip about starting the day in the money - agree that it makes sense not to be digging yourself out from the second trade onward. Your second trade of today makes sense but I fail to understand why you took the first trade. Would you mind giving me a clue??

--- 帖子 #219 ---
nico.. that one was just plain stupid, lol, its the best explanation i can give. It was not a valid signal, i just took it to test the water during lack of signal time, which i highly recommend for everyone to avoid such actions.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Thanks FXE, thought I had missed something!

--- 帖子 #221 ---
GU setup with entry around 1.5087 but missed entry, was watching another pair... FXE, did you take it?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
no missed it too.. it was a valid one.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
On my charts the high of the MACD setup candle is at 1.50873 while the TMA is at 1.50904 which is less that 3.3 pips away so I did not think it was a valid setup as the entry point needs to be outside the TMA bands as well. But very close!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I have slightly different readings, therefore allowing me to have classed that as a valid signal... Semi irrelevant though seeing as I missed entry whilst watching other pairs... Still waiting first valid, tradeable setup...

--- 帖子 #225 ---
guys i want to clarify one thing as I see nico and freshpips are having valid discussion about validation of the GU setup. in my rules I have stated that the entry point must be outside the band.. and that stands correct.. but there's a difference when price has completely separated from the band with a gap in between and then to resume for a possible setup and entry point that could be slightly inside or at the band, than the one that gives entry point inside or at the band without the PA extension and gap from the band. in my first post rules i wanted to make sure that no one takes action on a resume without price extension beyond the band. I hope my point is crossed to your understanding as the difference of the two. The main point is to get involve on a trades that Price has well extended from the band. Now if the resume is presented with a entry point way too far inside the band then obviously we are late for entry, but if its reasonably slightly inside the band, it is valid.. most importantly it must have clearly extend and separated with a gap in between to begin with. i hope i am not confusing anyone.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
FXE, this has been my understanding since following this thread. I suppose in some respects its down to personal interpretation, and also up to the person in question and how confident he/she feels about the setup unfolding in front of them. But as always, thank you for clarifying. (I had noticed this from watching the trades/screenshots you post that this was the case...)

--- 帖子 #227 ---
YW, and thats the way to look at it. ..Once there is enough trades under one's belt then it becomes easier and clearer to see and make best interpretation about.. I still make mistakes.. but with high confidence and preplanned risk control i know i got something to fall back on semi mistake entries to accept the loss and eventually to move on with a experienced gained. one is way better off to be active with care to sharpen the skill then to be extra hesitant to peruse perfection, at least in early stages.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
since its a slow day and i got time.. here is a chart picture live example of the early discussion to make clearer of a setup.. as you all see i got a sell stop of eu.. in this setup by looking at the chart its fully visible Price has well extended from the band with a gap in between.. however the entry point has fallen at or slightly inside the band!!.. but the setups main ingredients (extend pa from band and resumption) is all well in place and this setup is definitely a go.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
in action on all four pairs as valid setup was presented..

--- 帖子 #231 ---
none of them moved significantly in my favor.. against bar/candle arrived.. i slicked exited them with exception of gu sl hit for 7 pips.. its all good. they were alive for a reasonable time to make the push for real profit but it did not.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Potential EU setting up. Also GU if the bears push it down slightly further, aslong as 1.51 doesnt hold.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
..good observation to be on the ball FP, sounds like your on top of things, good on you. "Early perpetration and mass of screen timing will increase the level of involvement.. which is key to ones success in this style of trading."

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi FXE , Freshpips , I'm Getting ready , EU , GU ,

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thank you FXE. I very much agree that especially with this type of trading, you get out of it what screentime you put in... I try and be a step ahead so when that setup is confirmed, Im ready. I opened a long on EU. GU having trouble breaking 1.51 at present as suspected. Thats not to say it wont though...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
hi kelly.. i am in on eu..

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Be aware guys... 8 mins. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Yup ...Stop out -12

--- 帖子 #240 ---
same here -11, good exits.. we may get another crack at it.. i got my eyes on gj too.. will see

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Got out with a -10. Always difficult with news releases. Looking for next potential setups. EU still a possiblilty once the reaction to the news has subsided. Same with GU.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I always look at news as a 50/50.. it will go for you and against you and most likely when it goes in your favor you will get more than usual vs if it goes against you and it is not too sharp of a move you can control it and get out for least damage. however should not trade AT super major releases such as nfp, rate changes and speeches. regarding the bearish move at the moment.. as good as it looks, but i think it's weak reaction to the news and could bounce up nicely and i am gunning for it to take the first counter against it.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Long GU.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
gu -5 .. eu -7.. considering the move against the position and a slick outing it, its not bad. but damn ej got me big.. np, played it correctly could have been bigger damage. looking to take action long on gj and ej.. tough day in the office today.. can't expect otherwise.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Great exiting FXE. GU still throwing up signals to buy. And yes, tough markets today...

--- 帖子 #246 ---
i would normally try to enter again when i get a lower entry meaning break of LL with a failure to follow for new setup. like what its doing on ej and gj.. which i got already a buy pending on.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
my working time over.. took 10 out of the 12 possible signals (80+%) and that's all that it matters. I always grade myself based on the level of involvement.. wins will follow when this percentage is up.. IF one can handle rare days like today. I'll check back to answer if anyone got questions or concerns.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
FXEmpire, I have been using pivot lines as targets or the middle or outer of the TMA True. It helps me to have something to shoot for. What would you suggest? Also, do you ever use the signal line of the macd as a trigger for a trend trade? Or do you just do counter trend trades? Tks snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hello FXEmpire, Looking today chats I don't found the signals of your trades. Here is the trades I found: http://imageshack.us/a/img14/4823/gbpusdp.jpg http://imageshack.us/a/img254/7149/gbpjpy.jpg http://imageshack.us/a/img46/5971/eurusddm.jpg

--- 帖子 #250 ---
snarlyjack you just do counter trend trades, u will have better result

--- 帖子 #251 ---
jack.. I don't use pivots at all, especially in short frames where i believe that i am doing nothing but to trade the noise so i suggest to not use it, if your asking me. I don't trend trade in this style of scalping it's only counters.. so No i do not use the signal line as you see is not even visible in my macd. The use of macd for me is not the traditional way but rather is to have something discipline to go by, with the first little confirmation of exhaustion ( bold to narrow) of the current swing to take the reverse side of the deal extended outside the band. ps) I just noticed.. thanks for the vouch it's kind of you.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I don't see your images.. anyhow, i do not post a chart for every one of my signals, this is one of the main reason for explorer attach. but in the charts that i do post you would see a broken red or green vertical line, those are the signals. ..or maybe i misunderstood you entirely if your saying you are not "fond" of the signal of my trades, which that would be another story, lol.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
The images aren't showing at my post? Here I can see they, that must be a bug. I'll post the links here: http://imageshack.us/a/img14/4823/gbpusdp.jpg http://imageshack.us/a/img254/7149/gbpjpy.jpg http://imageshack.us/a/img46/5971/eurusddm.jpg Thanks for the reply.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
it don't open for me.. plz post as normal like mine and others where its large and visible. anyhow by looking at my charts with the description i gave above you can easily see the signals, but today in particular i only have posted one live chart, i could now post all signals of all four pairs, need a minute or two. ps) my apologies, I'll post them tomorrow i am a bit tired.

You wont believe me but I opened a long from 39 and closed for +10... It went up 70 pips It paused, and I chose to take the profit whilst it was there to make up for losses from this morning... it happens.

Closed @ 41 - taking too long to move... +7

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Still work?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Give yourself a pad on the back for being active enough to be in it to begin with and taking a piece. Its hard to say in hindsight how that long bold bullish candle had moved to close as such.. but if you or anyone, ever see such strong one way move in favor of your position with firm break of the opposite band, then give it some leniency for bigger profit with eye on protecting the +15. It happens at times as it did last week on couple of trades i had where i got +50s and it seems this one was the same scenario which could have been a bank for minimum of 50. be sure to know that this type of signals will only happen to those of us who are superbly active and not to the one who take long lunches, lol, or ones who work part time or overall slacking off.. freshpips from what i see is very active and determined at it and he almost got the whole bounty, you get'em the next time for sure.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Much appreciated FXE. I remember that for future reference... Not sure how much more action we'll see today, it seems those moves earlier have stunned the markets... GU is the only one that hasnt pulled back yet after the burst of USD weakness. AU has pulled back almost 50 pips since peaking, and EU has pulled back 40 odd pips. GU has kept on going, so may be worth a short if a decent setup presents itself...

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hello FXEmpire, What you think about trade de AUD pairs during the Sydney session? Have you already tried? Due to the timing of my country can not operate in the London session. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
He uses ,ew,eg,gu,gj, because they have 100 pip daily range. You can probably use anything that has 100 pip daily range. Also check his post #33 &amp; #34 good trading there down under.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
So I think the AUDCAD AUDCHF and AUDUSD will be good pairs to trade at Sydney session. Thanks Sparrow.

Real shame the posters of this thread seem to have dissappeared...

--- 帖子 #290 ---
don't worry freshpips your doing a nice job and getting the hang of this keep it up bud. This style of scalping is tough and rough and not for everyone.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Thanks FXE. Entering some fantastic positions, but this week I have been my own biggest enemy by exiting too early... I seem to still have difficulty calling it right.. I dont expect to be able to extract every pip from every move, that would be very unrealistic, but exiting a positon for +10/15 for instance, only to see trade continue through to +50 or higher, massivley frustrating... On the other hand, winning trades are winning trades.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
FXE, I notice you have traded a few breakout trades recently, is there a reason you have switched methods?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I have not switched method i was just trying to get maybe a couple of lucky break to bring the account back to around 500 so i can work it as normal. I would never trade breakouts as a method to rely on consistent profitability. sorry for the late reply, i took a long weekend off as I do time to time.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
ok everyone.. as you all followers of this thread know i purposely tried to trade a very small account at higher risk than normal (400$ at 7-10% risk per trade) to prove a point, that a good skillful trader could still perform and survive under pressure of harsh MM and if not, then at least has measured its own strength and production as a confidence builder in what he does and could do under normal conditions. sure account has failed and it's down to useless.. account wise this task has failed with full transparency, no deny in that and no need to bcz its besides the real point of this task. however the study of the trade explorer may prove something else and has served its real purpose, I hope. anyhow this was my real intention. Now.. moving forward.. I would setup a normal condition.. which requires a larger account and reasonable MM. I would put up the new explorer account by no later than start of following week.. again with full transparency, and in this one it should reflect all my scalping trades off my major account which on the one before at times it did not due to lack of capital. anyways.. i look forward to see your activities in here and i do my best to be around as much as i can to help.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Aslong as this thread is continuing then I shall continue to post... I look forward to seeing your next wave of results. Nothing for me so far this morning, I always air on the side of caution on Monday mornings. There hasnt been too much movement so far. There have been a couple of trade setups this morning that have ended up profitable, but have opted to stay out of the market so far.. Still awaiting first strong setup...

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Very slow morning. Still no trade for me with regards to this system... Looks like we'll have to wait for the US session for some opportunites... Maybe it will take the news this afternoon to get this moving...

Wheres everyone gone?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hey Fresh, i'm still trading the system, I think Empire is regrouping with new money management techniques, I never used his MM as it was too agressive for me, however I believe the system is still valid. I have not heard form him, wish he would stop in to let us know whats happening. EU has got the Monday slows and I steped out to do errands when a signal came up during the NY open so I wasn't here to take it.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Good evening Sparrow, Glad your still around. I agree that the system is most definitely still valid. On certain days it produces some phenomonal results. However, I have tweaked the rules slightly in order to protect myself against some of the larger losses, I dont have 50 pip stops ever. And I try and use it in conjunction with other useful levels in order to try and establish the really strong setups from the not so strong... Today was a crappy market. Ended up on -12 for the day. However this was due to me overtrading out of boredom. My own fault. Looking forward to a big day tomorrow, hopefully Wednesday gets this market moving... Best of luck Sparrow and make sure you continue to pass through here every few days, Ill do the same.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi, Traded EU this Tue 9:30am est entry got 22pips with Empire rules. left some on the table as the day turned out it was the only good trade to be had. i'm happy with the 22.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi guys.. I been vacationing the last couple weeks or so and I only keep up with my long term trades during such time. I should be back trading full force from next week on and get busy with scalp and short term stuff. Sorry for not being around but I do check from time to time and i see recently some activities from some of you which is nice to see. I hope you all be engaged more for remaining of this week and warmup a seat for me so from next week on to be trading all together. If there is any question or concerns etc, I will make the effort to check in here before bedtime. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
hi sparrow good to see you active in here. No need to regroup, I completed a task where i explained from beginning it was a task to prove some what of a point some may benefit from it some may not. The MM believe it or not is not as important as the risk control management skill, however, together it will be prolific. The MM simply would be the standard of risking no more than 2% per trade as i have mentioned in the past. keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Glad to see your still around FXE. Was starting to wonder if you had abandoned ship lol. Been trading your system along with a slightly modified version and have been seeing some fantastic results. Finshing today on +63 which im more than happy with. As an average, anything over +20 is a good day in my opinion, and can be made into a lot of money. I havent been on this thread as much as I was largely due to the fact that it was only Sparrow and myself posting. If you are coming back all guns blazing then I will make sure I am as involved as I was a couple of weeks ago. Just feels a bit pointless posting when theres nobody on here to see them! Anyway, glad to hear you are coming back, and looking forward to you, Sparrow and I hopefully moving forward and discussing the possible opportunites we have set in our sights... Looking forward to next week...

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Nice results friend, glad to hear it.. if you like you can go ahead and share your modifications so we all may benefit from, i don't mind it coming from true followers such as yourself. I will be trading full time tomorrow, it be nice to have all you guys around.

Be with you Friday @ the NY open and trading EU

Happy to have you sparrow. to everyone.. I just put up the new explorer account to be set to takeoff tomorrow. I will be risking the standard 2-3% max. My average loss has been no more than 12pips scalping. for those of you who are interested in MM preferred for this method follow below: Standard or conservative for newbies: account size X 2% / 20pips SL avg = lot size eg, ($1000 x 2% = $20 / 20pips = 0.1 mini lot, $1) Advance: account size X 2-3% / 12pips = lot size

just had a trade on gj.. but i was late in front of my system so may entry was a bit late and i could not play accordingly. but if your entry was on the ball as i have show in the picture.. then easily after such fake out with slick out opportunity given with that bearish candle could get away from a sure 20+ loss. anyhow a small demonstration of a early trade opportunity.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
It has been a difficult day.. it turns rough after entry. just managed to get 10 out of this one but should have been more.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
The EU looked the same as the Ej and the EU counter trend trade only gave up 16 pips Have an enjoyable week end! see ya next week

--- 帖子 #326 ---
hi.. looking forward to the new week.. just had my first trade done on gj which end up as a slick out. could be a slow day due to lack of data etc, but i am here and looking for new opportunities..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Very slow this morning so far, and with very little news to get things moving I believe it will continue like this for the rest of the day, unless NY can get things moving... Anyway, awaiting setup... Hope everyone is well...

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi there, can someone please tell me where i should put the scalper.tpl and the market zone posted on page 1, also the mac d is not the same as on the charts. Thank you in advance. Hoping to use this scalping system, thank you FxEmpire

--- 帖子 #329 ---
HI Harry, templates go to, MT4,broker name,template macd and market zone indicators go to, MT4,broker name, experts,indicators settings are macd: 6,14,0 bands: 56,2,100 zone= your preference

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Just the 1 trade for me today on EJ long @ 127.52 after it bottomed out for the day and took +27 from the move. Could have held on and taken over 50 but with being Monday and very little movement earlier, I decided to take what profit was on offer. A Few very nice moves though in the end... Catch you all tomorrow, hopefully we'll have a busier day.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Sparrow Thank you for your reply and all sorted.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
2 fantastic trade opportunites on EJ and GJ. I took EJ for + 25 but should have taken more, and didnt take GJ due to the entry being just below 150. Thought there was a chance of 150 holding and sending price back down so I chose to pass on it. Awaiting next valid setup.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
nice job freshpips.. you are correct ej was the best setup. I be here trading for rest of the day.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Good morning everybody, short EU @ 3132 closed for +11 pips (out too early)

--- 帖子 #335 ---
sparrow... i give you a tip on exits that could help you on premature bailouts. ..on your eu trade or as such when PA is running strong in your favor.. you want to not even think about exit until you see at least a few blinks of opposite macd bar (in this case a narrow bearish bar). this will help you to not lose out on such runs for more timely exit overall.. try it and let me know how it goes for you.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
long on gu..

--- 帖子 #337 ---
-15 on first try, no chance of slickout exit.. reentry as i think the bear move is weak and should pullback or reverse.. will see

--- 帖子 #338 ---
long on eu..

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks for the tip, i have been bailing out too early on alot of my trades latley, your tip should help.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
couple nice bank today on my latest trades..

--- 帖子 #341 ---
hi everyone, looking for a early start here today.. ej and gj are outside of the band and looking weak for continuation.. so counter trade is ideal.. waiting for the signal to fully shape.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
short of gu..

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi FXEmpire I have been following your thread, your system suits me, I have been doing great with it, thank you and have taken u/j long and e/j long

--- 帖子 #344 ---
glad to hear your having success friend, keep it up. I am long on gj.. just triggered.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Live Account I am in g/j also at 150.39

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Now a bit of heat Lol

--- 帖子 #347 ---
terrible start for me.. couple of mistakes mixed with rough pa.. good combo.. lol moving on..

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Morning guys. Waiting first setup of the day. Good luck...

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I got pending buy orders on ej and gj..

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Us/cad looking good

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I held my yen's and bought us/cad

--- 帖子 #352 ---
not a fab morning so far, anyway now short a/u

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Your right, hasnt been great so far for me either... Still hoping to be able to get the right entry for either EJ or GJ after the fall they have both had since the Asian session, there is a good chance we could see some sort of correction.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Looking to see if 127 holds e/j

--- 帖子 #355 ---
If 127 fails, then I will nextbe looking for EJ longs around 126.60 based on confluence of levels.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
you often get a bounce at whole numbers, not today so I feel it wont hold

--- 帖子 #357 ---
EU long @ 3032 closed +11pips got 17pips total and I'm out for the day. Happy trading everybody

--- 帖子 #358 ---
finally cut something decent.. lol I stay with this till real threat, needs to show a serious opposite bar.. risk is at BE. the move looks strong.. who knows it can run although way back, but i am willing to risk that for now.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Took a loss on first trade of the day. It was a EJ short from 127.70, which was also backed up by upper channel trend line. Yen was too weak. Escaped with -12. Looking for next set up.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Keeping an eye on GJ for a potential long.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Long GJ

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Fresh I took the same trade for a loss,and after being burnt we had a second short signel at 128 also weekly pivot I did not take it, maybe I should have.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Morning Logic, I also elected not to take the second setup. After upper channel was broken and price pierced 128, my biased changed to bullish for EJ, and it remains bullish. Currently long GJ from 149.88.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
out @ 77 -11

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Fresh at least you are sticking to the plan, we just need a nice run, I did see the small pinbar on the 5min and thought for a second about entering gb/jpy long myself,but it looks as if I have lost my nerve! lol news is out later that shoud give us some nice momentum

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hard market to trade today... Hoping tomorrow will provide better setups...

--- 帖子 #367 ---
hi all, got 18 pips this am on EU . see ya Friday. slow but steady week.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Well done Sparrow. Steady is the key word there.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
EU short @3086, closed @ +26pips yippy ki yeh , Yeh I know I only got 50% of that trades potential, but I'm doing better then before Empire gave me the hang on tip. See ya all Monday.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
you did the best exit there, not too early and not too late.. don't worry about the whole ride thing.. move/trend could end and turn at any time, our job is to get our share and be consistent at it.. thats all it matters. well done buddy.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
solid gu trade.. entry got cut inside a speed move otherwise it should have been a bit lower and not almost inside the band, it's called courtesy of broker, lol

--- 帖子 #372 ---
eu short..

--- 帖子 #373 ---
out on 1st opposite bar for -4.. no need to stick around when its stalling. just a demonstration of a proper exit and control.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi guys, I trust you are all well. I havent been around the forum much lately due to running some fairly extensive back testing on a number of methods. Results getting better and better and will be back trading from Monday... Be aware of Non-Farm payroll tomorrow so might be best to steer clear of the markets tomorrow afternoon. Anyway, catch you next week

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hope all is well with everyone. I found it to be a tough day today, again. Poor movement across the board. Won a couple, lost a couple. Lost mainly due to trying to hold on too long to trades that lacked the momentum to continue. Ended up +17 for the day but should have been more. It could have been less though, so I'm not too annoyed with that result. On to tomorrow. I will pass through here during the day, hopefully some of the regulars ie. FXE, Sparrow etc will be around during the day also. Catch you tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
HI Everybody, Fresh, 17 pips yesterday was a good day for you. Hard to make a buck the last two mornings. we may get a break at 10:00 but I've got an appointment so I see ya Wed. AM.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Currently long EJ from 27 After the huge bearish run we saw on EJ, could offer a nice retrace.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
This one was a -14 for me. Caught the next 2 EJ though, a long from 129.15 for +12, and a long from 128.97 which I closed for +11. Finished for the day on +34, thats including a loss of 14. Again, not an amazing day but It'll do. Catch you guys tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Question for Empire: What settings would you suggest for TMA true &amp; MacD when using 1m charts?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
spa, i don't trade the 1m so i would not know.. but I do know that you would need whole lot of other setting/changes into the plan when surfing different tf's.. so if you make the move i suggest to make fit of the whole plan especially the risk control management.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Ok, I quess that wasn't such a great idea, I'll stick to the original plan, 5m.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Good morning FXE, You've taken your explorer down, you not plan on sticking around this thread any more?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi freshpips and everyone.. I have taken the explorer down because i am mostly involved with my long term trading and not scalping as mush or at all these days, not to mention about lack of followers when the a few days or period that i was somewhat involve in here, so money was just sitting there without serving it's real purpose.. and it was not fair to show sub par results to maybe kill peoples confidence due to my lack of scalping activity. The method i have laid out here is a good one and I personally made my bones with it for a long time in early stages of my trading career, if one is dedicated and hungry enough, could stack up the necessary bank and more to eventually diversify and hit the market from all angles with all cylinder, and find comfort to what suits best trading life style. My intention was to laid out the plan to show people a starting point, even with small capital to make progress in small frame, tight scenario, to develop necessary trader skill to preform under pressure, quicker decision making, no second guessing etc, which would serve a major part down the long road of trading career. I am a busy man, I own and operate a multitask investment company with trading covers as a portion of it, working with my group of traders/technicians. I love trading over anything else and covers the better part of my everyday, unfortunately scalping or i should say "profitable scalping" desires much screen time and dedication, paying minute attention to all details at all times. I was a hyper trader once, loved it and miss it, but just don't have the required time and stamina as i once had it in early stages of my career when i really need it to. However I am a trader/scalper at heart and still here to serve when and if you all need help. I will always attend to concerns and questions and if i see good activity i may show the a few scalp trades that if i make along side of you all. Anyways i have setup couple of my smaller accounts (long term trading) as a private explorer for personal down to minute stats keeping purpose on early stage progress watchdog. I would not mind to make it visible to only buddies who desires to see and maybe pick up some goods. I should also say that I would not teach or cover any questions or anything at all about those trades and account in here or anywhere, with all do respect. Trade well everyone.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Well Empire, I sorry to see you go, you got to take care of business first. Thank you for the trading tips and teaching this strategy. It's been good for me. Maybe Fresh &amp; I will continue to share are trades here. Again thanks and good trading.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Good morning FXE and Sparrow. Been away for a week, and just saw this message. Sad to see you go FXE, but I understand that other things must take priority... I will still post, as I'm sure Sparrow will. So do pass through from time to time... Anyway, good luck in future.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I think with scalping it's impossible to earn big money, because 1) sooner or later you will be noticed and set to delay/slippage/requotes, 2) if you trade with real ecn/stp broker, then with bigger volumes you'll exp.more slippage as liquidity is not endless, so the scalping can be very limited. And I haven't heard about any scalping millionaires yet )) I think up to 15-20 lots is fine, after that slippage will rise drastically. But, maybe, depends on ECN...

--- 帖子 #387 ---
PLEASE HELP!! i read "Art of Work" section over over and make for memory. you say if i use eurjpy i should can be 8pips and under unless stall to long or make for loose?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I Dont understand your question.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
sorry freshpips. i dont know how maybe is 7pip same for all pair? yes such gbpjpy same 7pips as say less mover such EUR/CHF? or GBP/JPY can be more like 8pip or 9pip

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Great start today across the currencies I watch... However, volume really dropped off these last couple of hours... Yesterday was very quiet aswell I thought... But some big news coming up today, tomorrow and finishing with NFP on Friday so hopefully be a more active end of the week... Hows everyone getting on?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
hi guys, just dropped by to see how you all are.. nice to see some activity.. I hope everyone is doing great and continue doing great. Trade well.

Nice one, I wasn't trading this morning so I missed it. there will be a next time

alright folk time to make some scalping, i intend to be super active today hopefully market will move too. I would not have time to show charts please follow the explorer. The smaller EP is where only my scalps are and the other one is the mix of everything along with my scalps. OK, looking forward to have you around to trade and share..

--- 帖子 #398 ---
long on eur/aud, uj.. and short on eu..

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thanks for sharing your knowledge FXEmpire. As i have no time to watch the charts all time, but i'm near my computer most of the day, i would like to know if someone could code an alert indicator which alert when full conditions are met? Example, when bar close above upper/below lower TMA line and MACD change direction, the alert would be activate. Also to make sure the gap is enough between the closed bar and TMA line, an option to choose the distance in pips which activate the alert would be nice. Thanks

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Good afternoon guys, Just the one trade for me today EJ selling from 128.80 with price hitting my TP @ 128.60. Have been busy on other things today but by the looks of things there hasnt been too much I missed out on. Good to see some activity here last week, I was unaware hence no activity from me on here. I will be more active this week. Happy trading to all.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hey Fresh, good to hear from you. Not much happening this NY am on the e/u , maybe some action later or on tuesday.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hello Sparrow, hope the markets have been kind to you recently I shall be around this week and like you say, I hope things pick up from tomorrow. Quite a bit of news out tomorrow to get things moving... August is always slower but we should still get some decent set-ups... Catch you tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
EJ short @ 130.27

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I just wanna share that I also trade similar setup but using ea. The result is similar, at least for the last 3 month, this kind of trading style do generate decent profit on small drawdown. In fact this is the only one that I use now, and stop using another scalper ea and two trend following ea. While the other three generate similar result, I found that the one that using similar concept with the one presented here is the most stable one in terms of generating profit constantly with smaller period of losses. I dunno why but at one broker my ea stop taking any trade, while the signal still generated. Maybe some broker just don't really like when trader consistently in the green. I also want to point that the "art of the work" in the first post works not only for scalper, and maybe the one that separate a winning trader and the rest. This one is i lack and the reason I use ea in the first place.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
passerby.. there is two ways to do this.. one it's to relay on your skill for feel the heat as explained it the art of the work section as you pointed out and the other is to act firm... to act firm one needs a more of a precise entry in order to plat higher percentage win rate. in here i have decided for people to develop market skill and go free style on entry and learn to manage trades post entry. of course i could give you all a filter for higher W percentage rate.. and maybe its time to do so since followers have got enough experience with whats laid out already and people could have a choice now to use either way and the chance be really explosive when finding the balance between the mix of the two. well, I see if there is enough interest then i make the time to introduce it and show a few live trades. ..this also could help the other guy who asked for a EA, however it hard to fit the tma true indi into a ea based on zoom issue there must be another tool to replace it but to act the same.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Morning All, Currently short EJ from 130.52... We need to break the zone between 34-37 for further downside... stops @ BE though so no risk free trade Good luck all.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Closed @ 130.16 for +35 pips. Great start to the day. Awaiting next entry...

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Great going Fresh, I'll be trading the EU this AM est. Hey Empire, Don't hold back, you have us happy regulars that are more then eager to learn. Thanks again for your sharing and teaching.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hi All, FXE, thanks for posting your method. Count me in as interested. I like the risk control method and am practicing with success so far.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Thanks dude... Thought the markets wernt great today to be honest, that was the only trade I took today.. I am working with 2 currency pairs at a time, alternating weeks based on a number of things... and the 2 pairs I traded today wernt too special. HOwever Ill take my gains from the first trade and call it a day until tomorrow... I think the fact that we are in August (peak holiday season) is rendering the markets low on liquidity/volume so not moving as nicely... Hope you had a green day

--- 帖子 #411 ---
FXE, Good to see your around... You know im still here, anything you ever want to add to this small group then count me in. Hope your well.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hey, I hope everybody got in on the EU short this morning. +49 PIPS I exited on S1 support line. You gotta love this, It works even on news day.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Well done Sparrow. I wasnt trading EU today so didnt take it. What was your entry?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi guys, just checked into see whats up and see some activity and interested people.. I will go ahead give the filter and how it works by showing a few pic and maybe get a couple trade in till week is out. I get it out in a minute in the following post gotta think how i want to explain this.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Ok before I start it is evident that to achieve higher percentage win rate one would have to sacrifices some winners.. meaning if you filter the losers you be also filtering some winners, if you can't cope with that, then i suggest to stop reading the rest of this post.. lol. for me.. i have chosen the freestyle option where i get on almost all my signals and counter it with trade management which relates to "art of the work".. but hey, here is the more firm way of trading this, try it see it works for you or not or if you could combine the two. If one can monitor more pairs and only get in on filtered signals and still work the trade management part then with enough practice under your belt could soon hit on all cylinder and make some serious money. Ok... plot the ADX indicator default (14) and two levels of 22 and 42. above 22 normally shows price strength.. and above 42 shows super in the current move.. this is where i want the filter to happen. Meaning when you get all confirmation for a trade to be executed, check with adx for one last confirmation to see if its below or above the 42 level mark.. if its above it, then let go of the trade.. if it's below it, execute the trade.. it's as simple as that. ADX shows the strength or flaw of the current move beyond the band, where we want to take a reversal shot.. so when it's strong it's better off to wait for a better setup later on.. perhaps when it double or triple tops/bottoms.. but you be surprised at how many times it will give you the better timing on the first try out as when price breaks beyond the band but adx shows no strength within it and good for reversal take down.. but hey, sometimes it show full strength but reverses like there is no tomorrow with out you in it. The point is that in the long run it will do more good than harm. This filter in return of missing some move will provide you with larger wins.. meaning now you take less trades but more reliable ones for larger move than normal 15-20pips target perhaps around 30 or even 30+.. more like a short term trading but with a scalp entry. I recommend if you want to use the filter option, then monitor more pairs and pick the very best ones. some of my long term trades are even picked from my scalp setups and they fall so nicely that i get a +100 gain out of them at times (larger explorer). anyways, try it see if you like it.. i hope it will serve as a good addition. I'll show some charts in following posts.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi FXEmpire , I've now read the entire thread and am quoting your last post because I want to ask , is this filter something you already use and your results in the linked explorer are a reflection of this, or is this a new filter you've come up with as a result of constant requests and or to help new traders to have a better understanding of your method? Thank you for sharing this , it's a great thread.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
just a couple of chart example for view of signals with adx... with some winners being filtered as well. i am just giving you the look of it thats all so you get the idea. also i have plot the adx on top of the macd for less chart use, if want it to look like mine.. first plot the adx then plot the macd on top of it.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
dear Damien.. the current explorer above is not as a result of my scalping.. its my long term trading but at times i do take scalp trades and people could follow it live when i announce it before hand. I have not come up with this filter just now.. i been trading this way for a long time.. i may not use this very same filter as i more relay on my eyes and the price movement.. for example when i see a super sharp move with band striking then i wait for a weak double top/bottom with then take shot with macd confirmation. but i have found through out the years that adx is not a bad tool to measure strength to some degree if you know what your doing, so i decided to introduce this with adx filter. The way i go by teaching is to keep it simple and show it by steps... i wanted everyone at first to really go at it freestyle and some what understand and develop the hands on skill instead of relaying on tools right from the get go.. i think now after some time of free styling and practicing many signal of bad and good one can fit a tool into the picture much better with better understand of its true essence. I hope it makes sense.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
this chart is a good example to get a good idea on how it times the winner better, (it's Tuesdays ej chart) as you see 3 perfect signals two fake outs and one winner.. with adx filter time the weakening of the move on very top at the correct timing ready for the drop or at least not a quick turn for sl hit or loss like the previous two by providing the only winner.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
chart is pretty self explanatory.. this is a live scenario as its happening right now.. now i go for a walk in the yard with glass of vino, lol.. i check back in a bit to attend to your questions or concerns or see your live trade off this very possible setup or other scenario with the new stuff.. good luck

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thanks , I understand , I've been trading with repainting indicators lately so I use them but I don't if that makes sense . I noticed that there's also divergence as there was earlier in the chart , the only other time the lower band was reach in the move up.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
solid example on gu today... first signal a fo, saved.. second signal right on the money..

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Morning FXE, Will have a look at the ADX ang get back to you with my thoughts. Thanks for the heads up. However, I feel as its August and the markets are suffering from low volume/liquidity there arnt as many good moves as there was pre-August so I may reserve judgement until we get to September and the markets are moving again. I know we have seen some wild moves in the last couple of weeks, but these were largley due to extreme news releases and therefore highly unpredictable... Thanks again FXE and good to see your still passing through

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks bud good to see you around too. I will be here scalping today if just could manage to sit my behind down.. lol

--- 帖子 #425 ---
short on uchf.. check the explorer for details.. the trades with lot size 0.50 are all scalp today.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Did anyone try this on real account? Does it really work? I read the first chart it is terrible

--- 帖子 #427 ---
eu was a good setup too I missed it.. by the way I dedicate all the scalps trades today with adx confirmation so if it's your cup of tea follow along for practice and better understanding.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Keeping an eye on GU and EJ today, I need GU to rise and EJ to drop in order for decent counter trend entries... But yes, EU would have beena nice trade to start the day with

--- 帖子 #429 ---
good for +24... good bank in the bag for a start..

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Got some pips last night on UJ. I have time only to trade a few hours of Asian and a few of US. I'm mimicking the TMA on Oanda with the STARC with same settings so it's not exact. I closed the third trade at +3 because I was falling asleep. I see now my reentry question would not have been valid on the real TMA because it's inside the band, plus the macd is not pretty. My first entry would not have been valid on the TMA either. :nerd: I'll need to watch mt4 more closely.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Super eu move example..

--- 帖子 #432 ---
jmag.. I think your using the regular TMA.. which is fine but it repaints and not good for back test use.. also it looks like you not using the right mac, i don't see narrow to bold its all bold on yours.. this is one of the important confirmation to set a trade off. by the way Oanda offers mt4 platform as well, it will make your life a lot easier.. leverage is a killer though.. lol. anyhow we all better get use to it bcz sooner or later max lev50 is in store for fx trading. anyways, i saw your post wanted to help.. good luck

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Took the EJ long earlier and exited after +15 pips.. Trade continued and is currently +70 Very frustrating... But 15 pips is 15 pips. Hopefully get a chance to catch it on the way down...

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Trade has now gone over 100 pips...

--- 帖子 #435 ---
no worries brother, what's gone is gone.. the important point is to not let it effect you or your judgments down the road, staying firm is key. however in this trade the 15pips exit is a bit too early as the 1st minor sign of threat is at +30 mark but the real threat was at +60 mark.. as long as you see green bars without much real narrow blink stay with it.. in the long run it pays off greatly. anyhow you should pad yourself for being in it to begin with as the only winner of the previous loser.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Cheers FXE. Just get annoyed at myself. But its not a problem... As much as Id like to take 100 pip trades every day, Ill settle for 15/20 pips 2 or 3 times day... I try not to be greedy... Also the reason why I exited was due to me having a level on my chart around 60/61. I know the zones you were talking about at +30, and +60 was obviously 130.00. However, at that time of the morning with an extremely bearish market I was happy to take what was there and prepare for the next setup. I try not to let what happened after affect my mindframe. It happens, its one of those things, and at least I took something from the markets... Cheers buddy.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
There was a lovely entry @ around 130.38/39 after making a double top @ 48 after this mornings bearish move/bullish retrace. Hope you guys caught it.

The red bold is your plan and stay intact, atta way. Mindset and plan of trading is the only two things we got control of in this market, especially when trading noise. now regarding the zones.. i just go with what i see in the 5m based on the rhythm of the move and nothing else, like round numbers or s/r etc I can care or less about.. just the hesitations on the current 5m move that i am in it is what matters to me.. it may give me 5pip or 30 or 100.. just wanted to make that clear. Your doing well, keep it up.

scalping is either of the two on the table.. one.. to have a system that produces high win rate with at least a 1:1 rr and to be at it super hyper.. the other... is to take shots after shots till you fall into a winner.. attack and control. . till one of your attacks falls to a solid winner or the bottom line of bunch of trades comes to positive as you have set your goals and plans. The second option is what I done/do and laid out here.. "Art of the work" is your biggest asset in here no matter if your free styling the entry or filter entering.. The point is having the leash in your hand to stay in control and sooner or later plant the winners. With risk control skill your RR will fall in your favor eventually in the long run. for a scalper "long run" means, a week.. trade your plan religiously the whole week and take account on weekends, more than likely you will see a minimal avg loss compare to avg win. bottom line.. mix of the "AOTW" with filter signals would produce consistent profit from your scalping career.

Im carving out my own methodology with great results so far... I think its important to remember that 20-40 pips a day can work very well for you. Aslong as the consistency is there and the disclipine to know when to call it a day. Greed is what I had to control, both in terms of single trades and also overall daily totals... Now I work to a set rule and it has made a huge difference. Ye3s there are days when I look back and realise I could have had double the profit or in some cases, triple. But then theres other days where had I not walked away with the profit I did, I may have ended up loosing it all... I just had to find what worked best for me... Like you say FXE, I dont judge it based on days, i base it on weeks, then months. You WILL have loosing days, sometimes loosing weeks, but keep to your rules and You soon start to see the account balance grow...

Very nice, cheers

Congratulations on the EU trade. It happened at 3:00 am EST so I was sound asleep. oh well there are always more opportunities coming.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Thanks FXE. I have your template up on mt4 to verify trades now.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
guys I am going to post the charts from usual 5pairs under my watch and mark the possible signals with probable exits.. I think you would like it.. it's motivating and builds confidence and may clear some issues for some. I think as a group in here it's good to do this at least one of us each day.. i go ahead and do the first one.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
The exits are based on risk control of whats laid out in here to exit on the first sign of real threat profitable or loss situation.. followers should know or recall the structure. (short blue horizontal line is the probable exit give or take).. ..a full active trader would have made over 200pips today.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Good trades. Busy day today. But why would you not have taken the shorts on both EJ and GJ after this mornings intial bullish run? I took 36 pips out of the EJ move, just wondered why you hadnt marked those moves up?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I only took account the filtered signal. They all are with adx filter which i introduced couple of days ago.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Ok, I understand.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
FXEmpire, Thanks for sharing your trading strategy. I am currently trying to read the entire thread. Chat soon.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Okay, been reading the thread. I have set up my charts based on the information I have found. 6 charts, but mainly I trade E/U.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
U/J Long signal based on the rules I have read so far. My typical areas of retracement are 30%, 50%, and 70%. I took the long on the next candle after the Green Macd formed. Closed long at the 30% Fib Level. Total +6 pips profit. Thanks FXEmpire

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Long NZD/USD Short USD/CAD By the rules I have studied to this point..... I have not gotten to the SL or Profit point yet, so I will be taking small losses or gains while I learn the strategy. Update: My max Loss will be -10 pips for now, no matter the high/low areas. Gains I will try +6-10 pips, hoping to get more info from the thread chief soon..... Trade Update: Long NZD/USD Closed +7.5 pips profit

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Both NZD/USD and USD/JPY which gave Long signals have reached the 30% and 50% levels. USD/CAD is stubborn, I will close it out soon, getting ready for sleep. Taking a loss on USD/CAD -7 pips, I will check it in the morning to see how the signal formed overall.

Morning, Im in EJ from 88

morning... good one too..

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Out at 62 for +26... May be too early, but I have a level at 59/60 which price appears to have bounced off. Happy with that as first trade of the day Good luck FXE.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
nice exit, near the lower band price hesitated.. good solid bank.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Nice thread FXE, just took the GJ trade, in at 796, just stopped at 785 for +1 pip. Just missed the EJ entry as too late to screen...

--- 帖子 #464 ---
thanks Ian.. nice trade, with more trade under your belt everything will fall in place. thx for the chart display. as you know i am in the same trade, still holding.. i like to see what it does at recent low 604..

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Thanks, should have been a bit slower to move my stop.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
out at +17... the most i could get for time being, I gave it much time to run for more.. quick bounce of its own little recent low so I take what i can. I think it will drop further, but "for what I think" I give it a small chance to happen, and act on what i see atm . (scalper mindset) next trade..

SL @ be+1 so going to let this one run targeting 130.8x's I know you dont pay any attention to other technical factors, however I do and there is a nice ascending channel that seems to have contained price to the downside...

--- 帖子 #471 ---
could be.. I pay attention to everything and see them.. just don't put too much weight on them when scalping.. relay more on the price rhythm at certain profit levels.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Somehow managed to close for +10 before that drop...

--- 帖子 #473 ---
JPY pairs went berserk.. lol

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Took the GU short at 1.56823, out for +16 when the previous low at the lower band looked to be holding.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
nicely done on both entry and exit Ian, well done.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Good morning! Thanks for all charts and play by play, I am taking a look before I head into work. I can only trade Asia session, but the London, NY probably give out much more profits. See you all later today - Good Trading to ALL!

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Guys, I have read this thread from start to finish I think I understand every thing, but could someone tell me if the entry on the chart is correct if not why not. and does it matter if the colors on the top and bottom of the mac d are mixed or do they after be the same, i look forward in trying this scalping method out and will post charts when I get the full jist of it. Thanks for you time and patience

--- 帖子 #478 ---
hello stompe... the entry you marked is not correct but you are close.. the mac bar on where you marked is not narrow.. the flowing bar however is.. so you need to wait for this current bar to close as a narrow and the candle to be also bullish one.. then you got yourself a signal.. which you would set a pending order (3.3 pips buffer + spread) from the high or low of the signal candle. now on your chart you are missing the adx indicator.. watch my charts and add that.. unless you want to free style entry. This situation if considering the adx filter, then it is not a signal.. you would have to wait for adx to be below the 42 mark. macd thing don't matter what color as long as you get a bold and narrow bcz that's a important confirmation for entry.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
What did you expect? You were buing on downtrend and you wanted to win? This strategy will never work against the trend.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
FXEmpire.......... Could you help with some trade entry queries I have? Would the 11:50am. and 3:40pm short Eur/Usd entries be valid from 20th Aug? I see similar (in hindsight bad entries on other pairs) not all trades will be profitable I know but don't want to take them unnecessarily Is the ADX replacing the MACD? found various versions of the ADX but not the one you are using. Love the clean charts, keep up the good work Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Fx77777, welcome to the thread. If you actually spent some time going over the strategy yourself you would not make such rash statements as that. Yes I understand what you saying. The age old saying, the trend is your friend etc etc... However, I am making decent pips trading my own version of this system, and I promise you this - If you are not greedy and remember that this is primarily a scalping method, then there is no reason why you cant make your pips, even against the trend. Nothing rises or falls forever - so why cant you profit from the pullbacks... Remember that. To put into perspective, I made 3 trades today totalling +40 pips. That to me is a fairly good day, especially in August when volume is lower than usual. Oh, and it was done in 3 hours and then I was done for the day... On the other hand, yesterday I took +15 pips from a EJ trade that ended up going on a bullish run of over 100 pips... and you know what, the entry was at the end of a fairly agressive bearish run. I traded against the trend, and in doing so managed to get in at the bottom of what was to become the new shorterm bullish trend... Green pips bro.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
show charts bud.. and mark what your asking. adx is not replacing anything.. its a addition option for the ones who like to go with filtered entries and not free style entries. adx is the normal mt4 indi default(14).. i just have overplayed with mac. if anyone wants his to look like mine.. first plot the adx then overlay the mac on top of it.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
guys i go out to dinner, be back in couple of hours. trade well.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Great work Ian. I took the same trade and exited with +15 for similar reasons.. Good to see guys like you on this thread... Well done

--- 帖子 #485 ---
FXEmpire................ Apologies for not posting chart with my previous query

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Maybe we could avoid a few losses by putting on a zigzag and waiting for "three drives" before entering. The move may be closer to exhaustion at that point. Just a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi FXE I have marked my charts are they now correct please

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Great to see everyone making some nice profits, thanks for sharing your charts. I am still reading the thread, and trying to understand all the rules. FXE, can you revise your template on page 1 so I can make sure mine is setup the same, THANKS..

--- 帖子 #494 ---
You've now been enabled to award vouchers to others. Well done FXE. Well deserved. Still waiting for a decent first setup. Keeping my eyes on Cable and EJ. Last news release for a few hours coming up in 7 minutes... could get some of the pairs moving more favourably.

N2FX.. template is complete.. the only thing is missing is the adx.. which is a optional filter tool added later on to the thread and I don't want it added to the template. Thanks for understanding.

Hello FX empire and other traders. Have recently come across your thread, and found a the final piece to my puzzle. I trade a similar system this, using similar indicators but in a slightly different way. I am now trying adding MACD with your settings, and I must say, it is really complementing what I have. So thought I should thank you for sharing your system and your ideas. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #504 ---
FXe Thanks for the conformation, now lets go pip hunting.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
glad to hear that brother. best of luck

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Been a fairly quiet day for me so far... But at present we have GU EU and AU outside channel so could be given some entries soon...

--- 帖子 #507 ---
GU short @ 94

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Stopped for -10 Looking for next setup

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hey FXE and everyone else.... did anyone try this system on higher time frame to clear off the noise of smaller time frame

--- 帖子 #510 ---
...did you get back in on the GU short?

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Yes I did get back in from 98 and took +20 @ 78. However it wasnt to do with this strategy and therefore I didnt post it... Kicking myself for not holding the trade, but to be honest, there was a backtest of a descending trend line that could have turned price and a minor level of S/R @ 74/75 so it made sense to take what was available, especially off the back of a losing trade...

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I am having a hard time taking trades going the opposite way of where price seems to be going at the moment,. I have been back testing and seeing many signals not succeed, but I see there are some that do pay out? I will continue to review the signals and results and in the meantime try some of these type of setups......

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Morning Guys

Morning FP and everyone..

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hi N2.. this is exactly what you do in this method of scalping.. you go against the current move and try to take your piece from the more than often pullbacks and occasionally the full reversal move.. remember your trading short frame, its all noise. You will get at best a 50% win rate here.. its the AW ( A rt of the W ork) that will make the difference for you. You take your shots and defend till you get one that plants the winner.. attack and defend till one surrenders. you defend for low avg loss to rebuttal the less than avg win rate. Your avg win/avg loss 2:1 is what will make the difference and not the high Win rate. In other words to say: "you'll relay on your skill than following a full technical system". You be the captain of the ship and not the system fully. Its either this, or, you go try to find a system that consistently plants 90%+ win rate with a descent RR and hope that it's consistent throughout the years. Basically if one can't cope with the reversal fact of this method and AW part.. then would not be successful here.. unless along the same path with a bit of twitching may find your own way of profitability.. but : "I will continue to review the signals and results and in the meantime try some of these type of setups ......" .. I would need to ask you with all do respect to keep it out of this thread bcz it's totally some other method than presented and practiced in here , I thank you in advance for your understanding. PS) This post is for everyone.

eu short..

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Is there any way to get an alert if the bands are breached top and bottom?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I like your approach to managing trades, thank you for sharing what works for you. I took EJ short instead and before this took a GU short which netted -5.5

--- 帖子 #519 ---
hi.. it's is possible to have such a tool if it wasn't for the zoom factor of mt4charts. So it has to be replaced with some other tools such as maybe ma's with levels or etc,. I never pursued any type of servicing ea's for scalping bcz i believe one need to be extremely hands on, otherwise move to longer term trading.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Thanks.. Considering filter setup, ej would have been a no signal, but gu was a perfect signal, kicking myself for missing it, nice 40pips dropper.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I was waiting for this band break.. let's see how strong and real is..

--- 帖子 #522 ---
...yes, i didn't have the filter on. Do now, so cool

--- 帖子 #525 ---
ej short..

--- 帖子 #526 ---
update on scalp trades.. close the eu for +5.. it cracked the lower band but quickly turned back inside so i closed it for whatever i could.. it was a low potential setup anyways. close the GJ for -6.. after the immediate fo i played the AW and turned -25 for -6.. ej still open but risk at BE... difficult day to trade its not making it easy.. the only easy trade was the one i missed gu, lol... thats the way it goes. overall so far at breakeven pretty much unless ej drops to lower band where i will take good look at it to see if it will break and if stalls i take whats on the table. I show charts of all this later on. its been challenging and i love it.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Helo,Im new to forex may i know what the best indicator is to trade

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I am closing out for the week, it was a tough one.. i got a bit hammered on long term trades but it will be recovered. The best thing about this week was i got physically more conditioned for scalping, so next week i expect to be full time at it as I am more free. by the way i closed the ej trade for small win where i should have made around 30, but it was rough and tough situation. today GU made some nice moves and I managed to miss both trades, lol.. that is why its important to be at this full time, can't miss too much screen time. I think today was possible to make very good amount of pips. I leave you guys with the gu chart to show the better timing of a filtered signal to get you in for profit just in time. I thank you for all your kind words and appreciation towards me in the thread and pm's. We shall rock next week together. I check in time to time during the weekend if you got any questions or concern to attend to. Have nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hello. It depends on what your looking to use it to ascertain. Different indicators will help you identify different things, at different stages. So to answer your question, It depends on what your looking for help identifying... Best thing for you to do is to play around with a few and see what works for you. Start with the obvious ones, such as MACD, Stochastic, Moving averages, RSI, CCI &amp; Bollinger bands etc. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi Babypips may be a good place to start with. Once you have done that, think about what style of trading suits your lifestyle better eg long term, short term scalping or something in between. Then, you can look over some of the strategies in this forum. The strategy in this thread is good, but make sure that you read from first post and look at charts, particularly from fxempire. Hope this helps and good luck in your trading. Ezzy

this trade turned out to be FO trade.. i had the chance to exit this with recovery or the most -7pips loss.. but i decided to give it a chance and it did not work.. now I go for exit with the least damage if it gives me a slightest upside look.. one thing is apparent to me that the current bear move is not very strong.. will see..

closed for +11 on the touch of the upper band.. wanted to net positive on the ej sequence after all trouble it gave me. exited gu for -2.. did not like it.. it could back fire on me though, lol.. but we trader live and die based on our decisions, its the bottom line that counts.

Hi everyone I tried entering a trade with this system. I had a 10 pip TP, which was hit. I think it meets all conditions required. Any comments welcomed

Currently long EJ from 43... After 130 pip bearish run this morning, hoping for a retrace...

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I think it's a bit early for that for me, one more bounce of the LL would be more ideal..

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Possibly. However, due to the low being covered by my stop, if price is to test the lows again and bounce, therefore creating another entry, I will add to my position... Didnt want to elect to ignore this set up incase the bulls go on a run from here and leave me behind...

--- 帖子 #544 ---
well most time it will hit the sl with shadow and then bounce.. or.. it may just cream the LL.. therefore pattern is broken and got look at all new..

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I cover it with enough to allow for spikes through the low, otherwise yes your right. And it has happened to me many times, more than I care to remember in fact. EJ Bears may not have finished yet, I agree. Just have to wait and see...

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Closed manually @ 31 for -12 Bears were not finished.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Entered long EJ @ 97. Currently back above 130.00, going to see how it plays out... Small risk.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hang in there Fresh, I'm still trading it. And experimenting with some filters. The ADX on the MACD I just haven't got the feel for that yet. I am currently using Gann trend line, when I get a MACD buy signal above the Gann line I take the long, If I get a MACD sell signal above the line (Pull back of trend) I wait to see if the first resumption after the pull back fails, if it does I figure the trend is broken and will go short. Anyway this strategy makes so much sense to me because all trends first start out as a change of direction or consolidation, and usually confirm the new trend after a pullback and new trend resumption. I do the opposite of course when the MACD signal is below the Gann line. May you have a profitable day Fresh. from the Sparrow

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Great to see your still around Sparrow... Good work on trying to find ways to make this system work even better for you... I have been doing similar things over the last month or so... Its a great system, but if you can put your own influence into it to make it work better for you then even better... Good Luck Im around all day tomorrow (actually later today!) so if you can, try and pass through... Was a brilliant day today, hopefully this is a sign that the lul of August is almost over and things will start to get back to normal with more volatility, which means more swings/movement... Speak later buddy

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi.. have not posted here for some time but be around this week to make some scalping trades.. be happy to have many of you around. I will scalp the 5m but will be mostly active in 1m which is a different animal.. it suites me more due to screen timing preference.. you will see me in action and could get the feel for it if you find it interesting.. watch the small explorer all the 3lot shots are the 1m scalp.. basically it's quick in and outs looking for 5 pips max profit.. its not a one firm systematic approach, i use variety of simple technique to read the price for a quick bite.. comment stuff like HH LL levels bounce, bracket, stagnation, swing out short term trend, Pullback play..etc,. Basic philosophy is to read which side has the advantage for a quick momentum burst take down, or if its neutral to play the bounce game... all and all in 1m frame. alright lets start the week out..

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Good to see you active buddy. You know me, I'm here... Found last week difficult... There were some heavy trends last week so for counter trend traders at times it was suicide... Heres to a good week guys...

--- 帖子 #557 ---
good to see you too.. to a good week.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I was just short on the 1m about 15min before the German news.. price did not go in my favor so before the news i exited pretty much at BE.. so just giving you heads up on to always watch out for news when scalping the really short frame. you may risk it and keep your position.. but you must know the consequence where a it could hit your sl at a higher mark due to spikes. for example I would have kept my position if my broker would have guarantee my set stop and i would have made money.. but hey they know better.. lol

--- 帖子 #559 ---
simple read of the 1m frame atm.. first check sign, shows bullish PA to HH level where it is a few pips short of days high.. then PB to where i drew the red level. 2nd check sign is the break out then quickly pulling back inside the level.. then the 3rd check sign is where PA failed to go up higher (where i shorted on the bold bearish candle).. and now what we are left with is a bearish unleashed breakout to new heights where i recognize it as a moving PA to only look for a decent PB to get on the band wagon.. that's how it stands out for now. folks its about constant simple read of current.. read and read and read.. then chart will make sense to you for a good logical trade setup.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
hi all you scalpers.. how's going.. are you killing it or getting killed.. in a mood to share.. lol open discussion.. floor is yours..

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I share my scalping week, so far.. I been active hyper scalping last couple of weeks like i used too, where taking bites out of 1m. I have done well for the week, not as good as i should have and could have, the would've should've could've syndrome he he he, but still done ok. However today was just plain terrible with yo yo-ing between win/loss where two of my losses was not even valid signals.. funny to say I hesitate on few valid signals and end up not taking action, results pure winners on no actions.. lol, strange never happened before, yaaa right, lol. I mean just crazy out of ordinary and routine stuff. You know what you got to do but just out of nowhere you just don't or just do the opposite, or do just some other crazy sh****t oops lol.. this trading business always manages to humble you, and that is why probably we love it and find it challenging to make the improbable, probable.. paint it before it happens to see if actually happens.. gotta love it and want it bad to put up with it. But it's all good, a dinner out with a model for a few beers and a good night sleep will make cure.. I suggest you do the same if you ever have bad or so so trading days.. trust me it works, lol. .. anyways this was a little about my day in a fun way to give the thread a little life as you might want to open up and share at times.. hope you found it interesting. be back tomorrow sharp.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
morning.. up and working the 1m.. into couple of trades already.. net down $113.. Franky session started out with small burst out of the Asian session high (brown line) but weakened back to same level and bounce.. I took action on that bounce that's the first arrow and my buy trade.. did not go to my profit target so i banked some as it looked dry.. then the damn thing dropped and bounce again out of the same level but did not manage to reach the previous high it made earlier.. so 2nd arrow is where i felt the possible weakness and took shot at short.. stubbornly held it and got smacked, the little eu news had something to do with it perhaps.. np.. moving on.. it continued bullish, made some hesitation at the Franky High (blue line) where I was eying to short again but did not make a strong initiation for short bounce and my pending was not triggered.. and now it's bullish out of the Franky High making new highs... still in my opinion a weak bull move, market maybe awaiting Dragies speech, who knows.. anyhow i am not fully long bias yet to take shot at PB point and still looking for solid short reverse at this point.. will see

took short just minutes ago, it showed a nice little DB with full bold candle, so worth a shot.. but not moving the way i like to move.. i look for burst and its not doing that atm.. so cutting loss short, control.. till it bust up for me as days progressing

--- 帖子 #564 ---
When I scalp the 1m.. I look for 5 pips out... five in, five out max. I use higher leverage but as you see it under full control and manage to hit 80%. I trade the 1m based on what condition is giving.. recoing whether is ranging to take bounces or stepping to hl's to take action on PB with the swing/trend or spotting exhaustion to go for reverse.. anyway it turn i will have a play for it to get in at the right moment to get the initial burst, bank and done with it till next setup. atm the way 1m PA is moving is a bit rough.. it's not strongly moving bullish but it is moving up rough, which this type condition is like no condition, lol or like in between conditions.. which could cause you to get in on couple of fakes before it bursts out of and take routine recognizable condition. patience patience now..

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hello FXE, I see and understand what you do and how you do it. Im working on something similar, however it can be very risky I have found in certain market conditions. But then again, your far more experienced i the markets than I am, so you'll be getting a better win/loss ratio. Ill try and get some charts on here later on and mark up some of my trades. Good luck. also, fantastic GU entry short this morning for over 40 pips, which I only took 13 from unfortunately. Still waiting for EJ to break current range. Have taken a few quick scalps long from 133.00 for between 10-15 pips each time but havent trusted holding them. Either way, This mornings been great so far overall.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
ok bud looking forward to your charts. .. getting smacked for the time being though.. lol.. day is not done yet and long way to go still.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
quick update... well, ya getting hammered for time being.. lol PA dropped from earlier sluggish bull move and dropped rather strongly where at the hesitation on Asian session high I did not think it would be as strong and took action long and got smacked for full sl... there was a nice buy entry at the Asian session low where i passed, the damn thing was looking too strong to take shot at, but it was a valid trade anyhow, it just there to show you how some levels are respected. I treated the bounce as a pullback where i took action short on the weak 2nd attempt to go higher failure, trade had some momentum for solid drop to at least to LL of Asian low, but it lost momo after small move so i lowered the risk by dropping the sl to half where it got hit as i gave it a chance for the final burst. .. now PA is stuck in the middle of high and low's of eu session without much momentum, its dried up.. got to see what it will bring next to fit a trade for it.

Took 15 pips from GU this morning from bounce from shaded pink zone... Unfortunately I didnt see what I needed to trade GU on the way back down. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Would have liked to have seen GU retesting the highs, failing and providing a valid short entry. It Would have provided fantastic R:R.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
good start of the week bud keep it up. I been in several scalp trades already this am and it's not bad so far.. looking for a big week, will see..

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Good morning FXE. I trust you had a pleasant weekend. Market seems to have gone to sleep a bit now. Fortunately I took that GU trade, along with a EJ long last night once I saw the market open with 100 pip gap, I took a long @ 87 and price hit my TP @ 132.27 for +40... So a very good Monday morning start for me. I share your ambition in looking for a big week this week... Some big news releases to get the market moving, but could be dangerous aswell... Green pips to you bud.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi everybody, FXE, wow a lot has happened here at my favorite forum in the past month that I've been vacationing. 1m scalping I'll have to try as I have not been all that successful with 1m in the past. RR 1:1 with 5pips. I'll give it a try, why not? how's it going Fresh? try the 1m yet? Well glad you got the 40 and I'm glad to be back and trading.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
hi sparrow good to see you back again buddy.. now go get'em.. lol

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hello Sparrow, I hope you are well. Glad you are back from your vacation, and ready to rejoin this thread. Havent tried the 1m scalping. I have been working on the 5m with some decent results over the last couple of months. I am not around much this morning but will be back here all day from about 3 hours time. I hope you can get involved today Speak soon, FP

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Fairly quiet morning so far...

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Trying a EJ long @ 53. Could be suicide if the Yen maintains its early session strength. However, theres other technmicals that point to a possible bounce here, even is its just a small bounce.

No I do not, sorry.

Your guys wanna know why am I down 24% scalping today so far instead of being up 12% for the day??.. lol

--- 帖子 #581 ---
sweet lord nobody wants to know!!.. lol.. ok, but it's too bad you would have learned a thing or two. That is why I posed it. .. anyways, I guess I am wasting my time here posting sometimes. Cya for a while.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Sorry FXE, Been away from computer... Why the loss and not the win?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I've not been winning so I'd like to know if there's an other reason then my not being in the groove yet.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Sparrow, Which pairs have you been trading? Have you been actively trading every confirmed entry you have seen? Between what times are you trading?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Fairly difficult market to trade this morning... Poor movement. Waiting for a nice clean move in one direction or another before I can consider a position.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi Fresh, I've been trading eur/usd between the hours of 7:30 am to 11:00 am EST. I've been trading the 1m. and I have not been trading every signal.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Isn't counter trend trading dangerous and risky, plus you dont get big moves, well most of the time

--- 帖子 #588 ---
i'll take the bait... i would like to know.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Just guessing, from personal experince: - you forgot that u have open postion, or - you switch to your main account(where you don't scalp) and forgot that u have an open trade. Btw, I think GU is heading to 1.613x. Have a short(not a scalp). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I have read several pages in this thread. Seems that I could learn something that I lacked, which are CONSISTENTCY. I am fully aware that if trades stall to long against your position most likely your SL would hit, but I often hesitate to close the trade. Or in another case too greedy and move my tp only ended in BE. @FXEmpire: Would you mind if I joined this thread as I scalp a bit different. If you agree: - I would start a live explorer with a very small account and promised to scalp as close as possible to how yout scalp. But yes I couldn't help to trade fibo and my predetermined levels. - I promised that I will only trade 2 account which is my main account and one account for this thread. Currently, I am homeless in this forum and need community to point out my mistakes or to cover my ass if I made mistake such as enter before news, put wrong tp or even forget to set sl. I am a bit sloppy sometimes I just forgot. This is your thread so its your decision. if you agree I would jump in soon tommorow if possible.

no video's bro.. make due with whats laid out, and there is more than enough live trades, live explanations and full visual explorer.. it's as transparent as it could get.

Putting it in nutshell.. as i intend to not spend more time than I should here. The "Millimeter factor".. from star to bum.. or the other way around.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Thanks, but I think I'll miss london session today. Have to meet my thesis adviser to report my progress exactly around london opening. What a waste, evaluating losing position is more valuable than looking at winning trades. It's important lesson for few who seriously learning. Looking at your explorer here is my conclusion(seems that my first wild guess is totally wrong) arranged backward: - When you lost 16.3%: it should be around top end of your tma and macd should point downward. According to your rule you should enter short here not long. And your entry seems a bit late. Maybe, you missed the entry and after price stalled you decides to take long. - When you lost 10.1%: after strong upward movement, price should be above your tma line. According to your rules, the entry and timing is perfect... for a short not long. - When you lost 10.4%: This trade is just before you lost 10.1%, the condition is similar. Maybe you intend to enter early but pull the wrong trigger. Your focus seems off, it is clearly showed up when you lost 10.4% and 10.1%. The second trade opened just 3min after the first one closed. Maybe you doing something that need full attention- Ex. participating in a discussion or posting. Trading while posting is dangerous , especially when you scalp. Done that before, my result degrade significantly while posting on EU thread and scalping at the same times. See you all later , trade well.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
What a waste!!!!.. what do you mean by that? Get you fact straight before posting. I was scalping the 1m, which has nothing to do with 5m stuff, ok. This thread is pretty much a open thread for scalping. That is why your allowed to do what you ask to do.. I recommend to keep focus on what you do and show your work before anything else, ok bud. .. by the way, that explorer, if is not live and not full visual, it's plain worth less, if is demo then just simply forget it in whole. What i put in nutshell there is about physiological and discipline than anything else.. where this two factors are vital in trading but more so for hyper scalping bcz it's dealt with speed. One or two quick narrow mistakes or miss-read or lack of speedy decisions, could and would change the out come in the heat of the battle. So, no matter how good one trader is and has been for a long time, still each and every day must be raiser sharp in mind and physics, in order to perform outstanding.. mediocrity and just good, is for losers. i can go all day on this psychy stuff.. but this should make do to get the point across.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Sorry if I offend you in any way. I mean we could learn from your mistake, as most of us here are learning from you. Just finished setting the explorer it's not active yet because no trade taken recently. It will showed after I start trading, maybe around NY opening.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi dude, this system is what you're using ni your explorer NCI/I - LT? If yes, wow! a great motivation to try to implement this. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Me again, I'm doing some tests now. Seeing your first chart, can you confirm that the entries from the attached image are correct? If yes, there is one bad signal and other 2 goods, and may be the bad signal was some announcement or similar. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hello guys, nice entry this morning on EJ - took 15 pips long from 58. Thats my only entry this morning I am currently on the sidelines awaiting next entry... Looks to be low volatility this morning, not much movement so far....

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I just remember that I have a friend that take similar entry on local forum. He usually scalp 5-15 pips, and enter after higher low for long and lower high. He trade with 1:1000 leverage, 2 standard lot on $500 account without SL and often average. Crazy guy with steel balls, I know that his success rate well above 90% I am able to replicate in demo but just couldn't pull the trigger on live account. His only monet management is to withdrew after his account tripled and keep his balance at 500. He burn account on monthly basis but his total withdrawals is huge. Lost contact with him but I'll try to dig his myfxbook and post here if I could find it. Btw, as long as I remember he only use tma true and trade within after price exit tma and reenter. Maybe we could learn from him to filter bad trades. PA is not very good this week, yesterday I was wiped out on gj short. It's happened quickly and after that price reach my tp, I want to reenter but couldn't pull the trigger.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I agree with you that PA was bad yesterday, I ended up being negative at days end unfortunately. Its interesting you mention that your friend traded in a similar way. From what you mention, it would appear that your friend trades in a way that I have been considering recently. I find that if price has been outside the bands for an extended period of time, and remains outside then price is trending too strongly at that moment in time to attempt to counter trend trade it. I have had days where I have lost 3, 4 or even 5 in a row due to price bringing me into the trade, only to be taken out within the next 2 or 3 bars. Yes, eventually you will get a great entry and profit once price turns, but theres a chance that you will already have lost more than you stand to gain. I think it may be best to try and look for pairs where price has been inside band, then moves out of the band, gives you an entry, and you trade it back into the band. I think trying to counter trend trade when price is trending too strongly and remaining outside the band is a recipe for disaster. FXE, apart from the ADX, anything else you think would be of any help? Either through advice, or other indicators?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
I am sure most of you who trade this method have ignored the key skill that I laid out in the 1st post right from the get go. I am sure it's even absurd to most of you, lol. You might want to go back and read it again and again and really absorb it and then go back and hit the charts to reflect back on your previous trades.. it just might do wonders as to how much less you would have been given away. you just might find it useful for such market conditions. The fact is even our grand mothers could make some money in a bull market!! or at least not lose. but what separates a great trader from the average and terrible one is in maximizing profit in the bull time and minimizing loss in the bear times.. that's all what trading is all to it.. and Market will not let you know ahead of time whats comping and things could change on a flip. Currency trading is dealt with money.. the whole world is built on MONEY.. one day is gov't shut down another day 911.. I you do not capitalizing big on good times you will not be profitable.. if you do not surviving the bad times for the least damage, you will not be profitable. Trading is not cut and dry, it can not be put a square box around it, you can not count on fix profitability time frame. .. so it all boils down to this after all said above.. You can not change the market or economy or etc,.. what you need to do in order to come out ahead or for the market to pay you (bcz you should know by now that he is your BOSS and not the other way around), is to make yourself more valuable to the market place . That means and simply put is to become a better trader!!.. become a versatile trader, become a more informed trader, become superior at the necessary trading skills and learn variety of it. all this might just help you to ease down the damage in the bear market and make you excel in the bull market. "Make yourself more valuable to the market place" .. technical stand point.. sure why not here is couple of more indies I can suggest.. but before I do remember its a give and take.. it saves from one loss today and takes away a winner from you tomorrow.. it's nothing like a hands on skill, just as a reminder. Try, stochastic oversold over bought.. Candle formation to spot weakness before entry.. I can go on.. entries at best are 50/50.. what you do after it, it's what counts.. and that's the "Art of the work".. but what am I saying, its absurd to you all anyways.. lol . god bless.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Great post bud. I've inboxed you.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi Just 1 question. According to the original method your trade duration should be mainly less then a hour. in your trade explorer there are trades with 5-10-40 hour duration. Have you changed something ? I have checked the explorer after reading the post till the 9th page. Excuse me if i missed something described later. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi folks.. I just opened my own Journal and would be active in the link below. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...20#post7066420

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hi folks.. it's been a long time I have not posted in here but looking to get back active with 2nd version or new method of scalping. I guess there is some concerns spread around about low volatility/momentum less market which makes the shorter term trading more appropriate and lucrative. Personally it's routine for me to trade both short term/scalp and long term as for always. This time around I would introduce a simple momentum/trend following method for picking small gains focusing on 8 major low spread pairs. Price action and couple of simple tools is all required. As always with me you will get a full visual TE, especially for this kind of quick in and out method with no time to post charts.. perhaps one of my depleted TE account, lol. If there is enough interests I continue on for today otherwise I get out the details when I can.. talk at you later..

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Looking foward to read your new scalping method . Market's are not trending, so for me would be a great help learning to scalp.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hey FXE, welcome back, of course I'm interested in your new scalping strategy. bring it on. Sparrow

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hello FXE, Good to see some activity on this thread again guys... The market is Definitely suffering from lack of sustained moves and low momentum at present... As always, interested to observe any different methods to maximise any potential move the market makes... I'll keep my eye open on this thread for any details...

--- 帖子 #613 ---
FXE good to see you around, I shall look forward to this new set up

--- 帖子 #614 ---
hi again to all.. good to see the old boys like FP and sparrow as I recall.. I am going to spit this out in a short time.. to get a quick start on your charts.. plot the 200 ema and the good old macd 6/14/0 setting.. stay tuned..

--- 帖子 #615 ---
ok before i get the wording out I post a chart on a live trade on this off eu... the picture should explain a lot.. I call this the step method.. you got to have strong equal or grater steps..

--- 帖子 #616 ---
This is a simple momentum following scalping method that I follow on 8 major low spread pairs.. (e/u-g/u-u/j-u/cad-u/chf-a/u-e/j-chf/j) ema 200 and macd 6/14/0 are the tools... ema 200 is just used to see direction of the current move.. first and for most we want a strong move striking away from 200ema.. to gauge that you can use the mac 6/14 also as to how it sticks out.. next.. simply we want a pullback... to gauge and trade with discipline we use the mac 6/14.. where we want it to turn to the opposite side and trade it in the direction of the recent move on its first close of narrow bar. basically it's all price action move and pullback.. to make it more clear and something to go by or discipline it as a plan we use the two tools which I have set the settings of these tools to my needs of price action that I want. now filtering... obviously your looking at a pattern.. your looking at a step pattern, clean HL/LH.. when pullback is too strong and breaks the previous HL/LH or pullsback to ema 200 or beyond it.. then most likely the strong establish momentum move has been weaken or diminished, therefore you disregard anything afterward. I get some chart pic up from todays setups for clarity..

--- 帖子 #617 ---
au setup presented today..

--- 帖子 #618 ---
u/cad strong momo bear move.. pulls back relatively reasonable considering the initial move, still below the breakout level away from ema.. this one not so cleanly stepping though but good enough to get your 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
yesterdays eu action presented nice setups.. good looking strong clean steps.. we look mostly for one clean setup a day out of each pair.. when getting two a it's a bonus.. three, well I say be careful bcz it could be exhaustion time. I talk more about this stuff.. still some key stuff to cover.. i see if your still interested.. but the basics is covered.. ask questions..

--- 帖子 #620 ---
by the way that eu live trade on first chart hit the estimated target as well.. today considers as a good solid scalping day for this simple straight forward method.. it has been fruitful with good clean signals and mostly winners.. as you see it's nothing secret about it for most part one can spot it with even naked eyes.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
ej's loser.. chance for a re-entry.. but i would not take much shots at re-entry bcz to me the fake out shows lack of momo for the time being and once it's momo-less there is no point in being involve.. accept the loser and look for another better step setup.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
a few key points for better structure and success.. -Buffer.. once you have a signal I recommend to place buy sell stop orders with buffer + spread.. I use a 2.3 pips buffer. -Re-entry.. I don't do it but its up to you. -MM.. entirely up to you based on you goal and agenda.. the norm is 2% per trade I guess. -Major news.. overall don't be involved around the release time and mostly no pending to be standing. -Best time of trading.. I recommend to look for a move after londi open and again nys.. -Expected amount of signal.. it varies, obviously if you don't have signals it should mean there are no sustain enough of momo moves, but, hopefully to avg one signal a day out of each pair for 5 a week .. even 3 a week out of each pair should be good. ok couple of more important notes.. When gauging the initial swing move .. your looking for a breakout swings that are not too little or too big. Average daily move on a given major pairs is more less about 70-100 pips.. so its logical to think that if your initial swing move is too large, then it could have already reached its peak or exhaustion point.. so it less of a perfect setup. eg, the gbpusd today's move is a good example.. 95 pips straight away move breakout from 200 ema.. its better to stay away from such situations. now.. Trade Management as a recommendation.. this is the sticky part that you might not like.. and thats ok, do as you like.. it's advance play anyways. More or less if you agree with me or not, scalping in its true sense is a gut and feel play.. sure, I have recommended a firm 10pips stops and target, but it's important to also be aware of the rhythm of the pa post trigger. so i recommend.. post your entry trigger, if price fakes you out right away deep into around your stops about 7-8 pips lets say.. at this point if before taking out your stops it resume back a bit to anywhere close to your entry point, then be finger ready to close that position for smaller loss.. this would count as your defensive sleek out play to keep the avg loss in-check for smaller than 10 pips. Now, same goes on the offensive side, if price is taking it's sweet ass time and falls just short of hitting your target, and it's just keep messing around, be ready to take that 7-8 pips profit and to never lose money on such trades. What we want is to ride that burst with some leniency in the mean time, and bank, that's about it. so be ready defensively and offensively base on rhythm of the initial trigger burst or immediate fake out. we are dealing with a quick momo play.. your in it to hit your target soon and if that's not happening within reasonable time and rhythm you would need to get out and look for the next setup. This will take time and practice, don't sweat about it much, it's not like if you can't do this you would not be able to make money with this.. the setup is good enough for most part to firmly hit your target more often than not.. this is just a advance level of play to consider and practice in order to maximize profit by giving less away on losers and making the most out of the target short coming ones.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi FX Empire I have been playing with a simular idear as yours I have added a few indicators,to hopfully improve the chances of success, all stuff borrowed from other threads, so thanks to them, I hope you dont mind, so see what you think, your entry on eur/jpy would not have been taken with this set up because we did not get a bollinger squeeze, we then look to see if the colour stoc is below 20 indicating the strength of the down move,and delay stoc crossing 80 this is like a sling shot. I have marked your entry in red and white dotted as possible entrys, I am just toying with this idea at the moment. anyways I am glad you are back. Logic 38

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Hi Logig 38,.. Seems like wonderful system,...please attach your indies and template, so we can follow carefully your ENTRY and Clossing regulations,... Thanks in advance,... Budi Dharma

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hi 38.. thanks for the welcome.. ok the good old sexy b-band squeeze, lol.. sure it looks good for certain times, however b-band mostly looks good afterward.. the squeeze is not so much of a squeeze UNTIL it has broke out of it. I like to see if we can spot that live. anyhow i am not against it or any other idea, but, i suggest for today to try to show it live in the moment entry shots that way it be better to assess it.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
guys I would attach my TE to the thread.. don't mind the losses it showing currently its due to me getting slaughter on my long term trading in this particular account where i miss managed it severely. It sure need a boost and I look to bring it up with some aggressive scalping but still place both long term and scalp on it.. so if you follow it, the 1lot and above are the scalp trades based on this method. I may not be able to get you in time live chart picture entry due to speed of the work and monitoring 8 pairs where simultaneously could have 2-3 signal on different pairs.. so the TE should help you to stay in touch. ok londi rings in about 30min as i already see it's making a bear move... remains to be seen..

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Look very interesting FXE, Thanks for sharing. Going to look into it this morning and will post feedback etc. But anything that can make the most of the poor market movement we have been seeing is greatly received at present... Thanks bud

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Cool, thanks for stopping by.. looking forward to all feedback's.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
not much happening cross the board yet it's good time for quick analyses of eu as a example.. as you see it was off to a bear move after franky open, but the move did not sustain and turned completely the other way showing bullish move breaking away from ema.. will it sustain? remains to be seen still. Its a very small swing out to even consider as one but still could count as a step depending on PB's form... if pullback for here we want a small PB to be relative to its swing out to make for a clean looking step pattern. ps) folks don't mind the solid red lines on my chart, they got nothing to do with scalping it's based for my long term trading. thx

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi all the traders, firstly i want to say thanks to the author of this thread to share this very interesting strategy, i've read all the posts in this thread and right now i'm gonna test it on my demo account. Unluckly i have some problem and i hope someone can help me! I need of the indicators you posted in .mql format and not in ex4. cause only in this way my metatrader make it works. Now i'm trying with the classic MACD , but with my classic it's only possible to set in (6,14,1) it can't let me put "0", i dont know why. While for the tma true band i really dont know how to do to install it, cause i think i need of the .mql file. thank you in advance, Nepul

--- 帖子 #631 ---
nepul.. you don't need the tma true bcz we are not trading the old model of scalping.. as of yesterday I have introduce a new model which is completely different.. please read from page 31 on. (I will update the 1st post for new comer to come directly to current events) about macd, it don't matter if it 0 or 1 etc.. the important part is the 6/14. I don't have the mql version of it but if you search around i am sure you should find it.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
continuing with examination of current e/u condition.. as you see PB had fallen down to ema200 and way below the step level... to me this simply means there is no momentum in this pair atm as the swing out momo is diminished.. simple naked eye with couple of hl/lh lines opens PA hand for it true intention. conclusion up to now.. eu is momo-less, yo yo-ing..lol.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
atm u/cad should be under your watch... it has broken away from 200 nicely.. now again, will it sustain? if yes.. then will it step nicely with a valid PB?.. a lot remains to be seen still.. I like to let you know that the macd version that we use has a alert.. you can set your alert for when mac crosses the 0 line.. this was you can get a early alert for PB time and possible narrow bar for a trade.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
ucad as mentioned in the previous post.. looking for a clean step pattern.. I want the PB to not fall much below the step break out LV point with confirmation of mac opposite narrow bar.. so.. firstly i want to see the mac bar to turn bearish (when that happens it will sound the alert for early preparation).. then PA to not fall much below the step Lv.. then the bearish mac to turn into narrow and closes as narrow.. then pending buy stop place with 2.3 buffer + spread.. firm stop and tp at 10 pips. will see how it shapes..

--- 帖子 #635 ---
now about the setup in the making above on ucad.. still this setup is lacking some perfection to keep in the back of our mind.. 1) the swing out is not very strong.. it's only about 16 pips from 200 to it high.. we like this to be higher for more momo potential 2) 200ema is not trending looking.. preferably we like to see this trending in the swing out direction or at least sticking out a bit. nerveless it's worth taking a shot, buttttt with extra care.. that means if post trigger you see any messing around be ready to bail.. this is just some extra detail stuff that I am throwing at you.. scaling is about quick thinking/decisions on the fly but you can only do that if you have prep before hand.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
can somebody give us analysis on audjpy current situation.. is it trade-able? yes or no.. why?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
in long ucad.. not the best setup but worth a shot.. at least good for the sake of live trade learning puposes..

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I Personally would say no... The pair is obviously lacking momentum, plus we haven't had a decent step up yet... Plus we haven't got the opposite mac bars yet... Edit: We actually did have the opposite mac bars once I readjusted my settings, however, I still say the PB wasn't enough... And the pair itself isn't really trending. Its more rangebound.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
ok FXEmpire, i want to ask you something about your new system, cause of my bad english result a few difficult to understand the method... Well, am i right if i say that you're using the Ema (200) to be sure that a trend is running? then you wait a price retracement and that price make a pullback, then you wait for a narrow bar in macd to enter in the trade. But this time you will manage the trade in a different way than the old method, this time you place your SL and TP at 10 pips. As is doing right in this moment on usd cad?

--- 帖子 #640 ---
nice job fp perfect analysis.. we got no step up to even consider anything afterward.. it's void already.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
all correct brother, now go get'em.. ..and your English is fabulous

--- 帖子 #642 ---
well, 25min in to this trade some cluster right at entry.. no real threat yet but but not looking too promising either.. might have to make a survival decision about this soon..

--- 帖子 #643 ---
ok.. 42 minute into the trade nothing but stalling.. no real threat but just taking too long to prove it has momo left for a burst.. so in such situations I drop the risk to half and let it be for now.. most likely it will hit my sl but it's the right play with still giving it a slight chance for final gasp of upward release, lol stop at 5pips.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Long now? is it a good setup? trying to learn... Hey FXEmpire how long you use this method?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
you tell me based on what i have explained so far.. whats the main element that i have stressed? if you have that then you got a setup.. plus you need a mac indi that shows narrow, its essential. been doing this for a long time to answer your question.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
as you all saw the ucad trade was a loser for a full stop.. but i lost only half on it based on correct trade management as I explained live.. I took a few key snap shots during the play to show what your thought process should be during the play. pic one... trigger and turn back inside the entry point for a slight loss.. at this point as a scalper you should not like such quick move against your position, nevertheless it was not a big move against but it should be a alert.. pic two.. looking good with the engulf resume back above entry.. so makes you hold on a bit more to see if it makes the burst your looking for.. pic three.. bastard turns back into loss.. at this point it should be sign that the early analysis of this setup not have the enough momo is coming true.. so you should be finger ready for the out however it stalled a bit so i decided to drop the risk to half and give it one last chance for the go or out for the least damage.. this should help to understand the trade management part of the deal that i made comments on yesterday.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
as you all see today we got a weak 30piper range market so far and with simple step technique you can recognize the momo-less market to avoid unnecessary involvements.. as a good example we were able to simply avoid getting involve on audjpy.. those are the saves that are essential to your success as a scalper. the ucad trade.. I would normally not trade that based on my experience and feel, but I wanted to display it live for the sake of learning. be sure that if PA produces the slightest alive a kicks, you be able to make the early recognition with the steps and benefit from it from its early point (6/14 mac pb) for the quick gain.. yesterday was a example of a fruitful day. anyways I hope it serves you benefit on your scalping activity.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
why it's not recommended to not trade this signal?.. it could be a winner.. who knows .. but why is it not a high probability play in a long run?

--- 帖子 #650 ---
"you tell me based on what i have explained so far.. whats the main element that i have stressed? if you have that then you got a setup.." by the way i posted that photo cause for me it seems very similar to the signal you took with usdcad, but maybe i wrong to understand something EMA is similar Distance from EMA also similar, but anyway we need more distance as you said for usdcad only the pullback is very more strong in usd cad... "plus you need a mac indi that shows narrow, its essential." in my chart, as you can see, there is macd indi...what wrong? for narrow bar you mean what i say in this photo? i hope you'll have patience with me...

--- 帖子 #651 ---
I like to clear up one thing in regards to low volatility today.. I am fully aware that its the Minute day.. I am fully aware of every f-ing news, I you we all should know about them before start of each week and day... but as a scalper that should not put you on the sideline automatically.. I have had boring but as well as killer days out of rate change days, phily fed, minute, etc and even the frigging nfp days... scalper is a wolf with a jet eye always looking for a take down.. I am sure some people don't agree with this but hey wouldn't be just too boring of a world if we all agree on everything, lol.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I have patience but very littleeeee.. lol jk... however i don't spoon feed bcz it just simply not good for anyone.. I give you a hint.. try to focus more on the PA and not the tools as much.. see where the PB point is on aj than ucad in relation to steps.. and tell me what you find out.. if you focus on mac tool.. you'll end up with gazillion signal a day, lol

--- 帖子 #653 ---
nobody!!.. ok I tell you all what... I'll be active explaining shit for at most till week is out.. based on traffic i see below I assume there is interests.. I pose questions for your better understanding, not mine, lol.. take advantage while it lasts..

--- 帖子 #654 ---
As i think to understand, you want a trend to have the signal. In that photo there's no trend but price is ranging. Your method as i suppose to understand : price start a trend breaking some low or high( you know it also but EMA), after it make a pull back and should bounce on some previous ex support resistance, there you take the entry from the narrow macd bar in the direction of the trend.. am i right?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Sorry mate, was away from computer... Please explain. I wouldn't have traded it purely based on poor range bound market and not a clear step, pullbacks have been too steep, lacking momentum and direction... but Im sure you have another reason?

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I don't mean you brother you got this down already.. your correct as it's simply again there is not free away from the range bond.. pa is not stepping.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
since I have introduced this I feel obligated to reveal the PA deceive.. that's where the long term success is laid. the uchf is a winner and that's what the problem is.. the great market deceive, like poison in the long run, lol.. so I try to point it out as a heads up. Still one needs to roll with punches. anyways.. some movement with uchf and ugbp as early potentials..

--- 帖子 #658 ---
FXEmpire are you still using the old method also?i liked too much that strategy. Should be perfect to mix and use both of them. The old method when price is ranging, and new when is trending, do you already work in this way? For example today there's no chance for the trending method, while with old method a lot.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I have presented variety so one could use everything.. but currently we are only focusing on the new method.. the old one is presented practice and done with.. what you do is your personal choice.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
i was looking GU... but i really dont like it, price ranging for too much time, it seems more a false breakour or a hunting stop, few chance for a trend continuing... the best for now remain usdchf, waiting for macd signal to enter short... looking also audjpy...

--- 帖子 #661 ---
FXE, thanks for all info today, shame there wasn't more movement. Thanks for sharing this method, looking forward to trying it out in better markets conditions than we saw today... Calling it a day guys, Speak tomorrow.

hi sparrow.. good job.. Can you post a snap shot of that trade.. bcz i do not see a clear signal on ucad. thx

--- 帖子 #666 ---
is it a good setup for your strategy FXEmpire? am i right?except for the time... waiting for a narrow bar macd

--- 帖子 #667 ---
http://charts.mql5.com/4/409/usdcad-...trading-oy.png A= down trend under 200 ema B= retracement to 200 ema C= Short entry at BP balance point and continuation bar on macd and exit at 15pip target ( also a doji) D= 2nd retracement to 200 ema E= 2nd short entry at balance point and continuation bar on macd and exit at 15pip target F= I usually never go for three retracements in a row. I hope this helps explain the trade details. note: the light gray area is the time and levels in the trade. Also note if your wondering, the blue/red bars under the Macd is the Gann hi/lo histogram based on the 200ema it helps me visually when studying the macd and the tend direction at the same tine.

Sharing some observation.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hello Sparrow... I hope you're well.. Just a quick observation. It appears to me that you are opening trades on the wrong MACD bars... for shorts we need to be seeing upwards mac bars then turning skinny coming back down to enter, and for longs we need to be seeing downwards mac bars then turning skinny on way back up to enter. Just a pointer buddy.. However it seems that even entering on the wrong mac bars got you a profit this time, so well done bud

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Nicely done

--- 帖子 #673 ---
SL = -10 Did i wrong something or was just normal stop loss?

--- 帖子 #674 ---
in the image above you also can see another trade, by the way dont care about it, i was talking about the entry of the vertical red line...

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Nepul, you are using the wrong MACD. On the first page of this forum is the correct indicator to use. You are not able to see the thick macd bars turning to skinny macd bars... This is important....

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Observations. EJ and UJ

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Thanks for the observation Fresh, I'm not sure if I was lucky, my observation was that the macd bar fat or skinny doesn't matter as much as the color. for instance, on the 2 short trades the retracements were not deep enough for the macd to be above the zero line therefore the continuation bar was red and fat. if the retracement was deep enough for the macd to be above the zero line then my continuation bar would have been red and skinny. It seems to me that fat and skinny don't seen to matter but red and green do. By the way, Fantastic!! trade you made this morning on the AUD/USD. Sparrow

jurn_e - are those arrows on your charts signalled from the MACd ?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hello everyone! New to this forum and thought I drop by to say hi. As my nick suggests, I am a scalper and hope to share my experience and trading tips in this thread.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
The arrows are from ASC trend, u can get the indi at Genesis thread.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
hey thank you freshpips for your answer...you are right! i couldn't put the right version of macd, luckly now i put it ! In that chart the entry was later as i you can see in this picture. is that the narrow bar macd right( i put a vertical line there)? i'm tryng to understand better the narrow bar entry...

--- 帖子 #682 ---
No problem buddy... Yes that appears correct... could have taken some pips from that move before the retrace definitely.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
The beauty of strategies Sparrow is that if you find a way that seems to work better for you then good work and you may aswell maximise anything you can... End of the day we're all after one thing... profit. Well done buddy.

some good activity today here today.. like it.. good job for recognizing the signals as there were some nice ones today. Ok now that I see interests and activity I will pursue further to show the better stuff .. tomorrow I'll give you guys the higher probability setup where the combination of the two would be quite prolific or provides options that might fit ones agenda better. I try to give it out before londi open.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
jurn welcome and good job on signal reco..

--- 帖子 #687 ---
good job spar.. whatever works and feels comfortable brother, that's what counts in the end. just a small note that could help out.. what your doing is riding the swing momentum itself and taking action on small dips before it takes the full breather (PB), which is good.. since your doing that I recommend to watch for the divergence when you trade the fat.. even on 6/14, lol.. when you face with diverg it's sign of full PB coming and a fake out on your signal. good luck.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
FX Empire, Waiting on ur high prob setup.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
ok.. the setup I gave you guys earlier this week is more of a hyper scalping on for quick in and out more for people with thick stamina. The setup I am about to give you in less hyper with reliance on more data and confirmation to go after with about 2rr.. now.. we still would look for swing out separation from ema 200.. then trade in the direction of the swing out when PA pullback all the way back to ema 200.. using mac narrow bar again once it reacts cross and close back inside... now this is not enough of a confirmation to achieve higher probable setup.. so what I as a more reliable confirmation is OB/OS (Over Bought/ Over Sold).. so plotting color stoch indi with settings of 30,10,10.. so confluences are.. 1) Swing out away from ema 200.. beating the previous recent High for bullish or Low for bearish. 2) PB to ema 200.. angeling out like its trending 3) 1st mac narrow bar cross closing inside for entry point now.. 4) Stoch color to be OB/OS... if these confluences are all lined up you got a setup to place order.. Stop beyond last HL/LH.. target you can aim for swing out High or Low.. which would give a favorable RR most times. its simple and straight forward more direct.. the two compliment each other because you will have days that pa trends without full PB.. so in such situations you can use the other model, but you would have more fake out, however you will have chance to hub on the bus.. Trading is all about give and take.. there is a price for everything just like everything else in life... see what suites you and serves you comfort.. one may want to do it all one chooses one over other. Chart explains.. this is yesterdays ej setup.. I post some more.. buttt, I like you guys to figure a few from this week and post them. I'll check back in a bit.. I got some construction going on in my house for last couple of days.. so bear with me.. post setups as practice, I only will help reply back to the active ones.. .. there are some small details that needs to be addressed as well for higher success which will be given out when YOU do some work as well, pushing the brain.. it's best to talk about them in the heat of live setup for better reco..

??????? ...

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Hi Fxempire, still thanks you to share a new method... i'm trying to understand better, and i suppose that in the first image there's the correct setup for your method(audusd, while in the second not, cause of the ema 200. am i right?

--- 帖子 #693 ---
not quite but your on the right track..

--- 帖子 #694 ---
PA bounce of 200ema in AU, PA broke 200ema in GU.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
correct on gu.. au.. regardless of bounce or drop.. is it a signal to place a stop order?

--- 帖子 #696 ---
I would not enter the AU, after the signal candle, there is no candle closing below it to confirm the bounce. besides, it looks like a higher high and higher low.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
atta baby... great answer... all one has to pay attentions is PA movement to make the best filter decisions.. this would be valid signal if there was no hl/lh with stock confirmation on top of it... we want the signals to swing out and pullback with no significant hesitation in between for a slingshot release.. otherwise it would cost the probability. well done jurn.. all of you who are interested but not getting involved should get on your knees and s off jurn, lol, for causing to reveal a great piece of success for this model.. I would not have given it up to you easily.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Looks like this GU trade broke out of 200ema but hesitated, not very clean PA, therefore the loss if entered. Whats your opinion FX empire?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
jurn as you mentioned it is not a clean pa.. swing out is not, 200 not tilting bcz of the short lived swing out. I normally with a naked eye able to reject this one.. however you would have losers too. your stoch setting needs to be changed from sma to ema.. also the ob/os for color change should be 75/25.. but keep the level 80/20.. thats what i use. I should have mentioned that earlier, so this is for everyone.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Solid short signal just before franky open, good for 20+

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Very nice FxEmpire.. Do you wait also price bounces on EMA200, or it's not important it?

--- 帖子 #702 ---
please read the post 689.. you must have at least a touch for better confirmation and stop loss spot.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Where's everyone gone!?

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Hey Fresh, I'm still around. This week I've been experimenting with regression channels instead of TMA channels, same strategy different indie. Market is not very volatile. not much room for pips in the NY EST 8am to 11am which are my trading hours. hope you are doing good .

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hey sparrow, glad you're still around... How did you find the regression channels?? You're right about the market, been very low volatility but towards the end of last week it picked up and this morning London session saw some movement...

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi FXEmpire, Subscribed

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Hi Fresh, too early to tell on the regression channel strategy, I can tell you they are a little frustrating for me in that they are in constant motion and not historically reliable, so it's tough to gain confidence in them. If this week is the same, I'm going back to FXE's original setup.

I have read all the pages, i got questions now.. is repaint ever been an issue with any of your indicators? I think i read somewhere in the page, someone talking about this with no reply ... from anybody ... I hope repaint is not an issue After progressing into 2nd and 3rd model ... which one you found to be more stable/robust to market situations? Thanks for your time

--- 帖子 #710 ---
no repaints on any of the one I use.. the talk of repaint may have occurred over tma indi which the regular one does repaint, but I use tma-true that does not repaint. all three model could be robust on it's own time but mostly all depends on the man sitting behind the screen to adjust and adapt timely enough

Thanks jenny.. I better do good nowww, lol

--- 帖子 #740 ---
just to give an update.. if you have been following I am only scalping GBPJPY pair off the small frame for +40 a day.. I basically look for a weakness to take on the reverse or strength at PB to be in the ride.. all this at low risk otherwise I reject it and wait for the next event. for eg, since last small up swing of gj I am gunning for the reverse.. it has shown weakness but not a ideal low risk spot to for entry just yet.. if presents a short trade I show it in chart.. I think its close to it unless it firmly OT's.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
short 170.239.. risk is around 10 and no larger than 15... this is the comfort.. the previous two possible signals were just larger risk than I would like, regardless of outcome.. it's MM.. I have no idea of what this beast will do next, as a scalper you do some math and react, thats it.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
and +10 achieved.. easy hun!!!.. not at all.. up +8 for the day.. 32 to go..

abo.. scalping is a very versatile style of trading.. it's mostly a feel and reaction type a game than anything else. In here I have provided several simple structures to fit different personalities and level of trading experiences. bottom line it sort of serves as home for scalpers who like to follow and share. now, between everything i have presented and do in here I basically take interest at two areas for a scalp.. one, is reversal take down outside of band or box (areas that seems to be ranging).. two, Pullback trade where price is moving firmly and strongly in one direction to get in on the ride at cheaper price. I think this piece of news should give a better and overall understanding when search through the thread in here. it's not as simple as 123 to put a cap on for trading period, especially scalping where needs a define direction and many practice. hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Do what fits best for you brother. I scalped mostly in my earlier trading days to build up a decent account in order to participate in other style of trading such as mid term and longer term where larger capital is needed. Now I scalp to not be bored beside just loving it. I wish i could be as good as should be.. the beast is a constant learning and adjusting game.

I took a stab at the short from 928 but kicked me out by a hair for a 5 pips loss before dropping for 30. sell order was placed right again at 980 where it seems to be the short term resistant but I canceled it right before the gbp news.. I avoid getting triggered at the release bcz it would not trigger me at the price that i set for. now after news it's wide open for take downs for rest of the day on this pair, gotta wait for the dust to settle though for the best low risk entry.. 980 is the area i would be watching for short.. long depends on what forms. just dropping some pointers here and there as how and what a scalper days alike for the things to watch out for, hope you don't mind

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Gbp is strong again today, be careful with the shorts . How about gbpnzd? I know the spread is crazy, but that really shifts.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
short 170.955..

--- 帖子 #761 ---
not as strong as me.... lol I flow with the flow of 5m.. based on that it is not strong.. it's 55 pips normal swinging flow.. risking 5-10 to get 10-20+. like you said gbpnzd is high on spread.. and wild like south American chicks, too tough to handle , lol

I personify it.. otherwise me and you both should look for different profession foxy.. lol

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I should have capitalized on this upward burst, set the buy order just a tad late.. damn thing happened just too fast.. did not expected that.. get'em next time. 980 holding up again for time being.. hopefully on the next short stab from here would take down to the basement.. lol

--- 帖子 #766 ---
I am scalping now GBNZ on the buy side only and NZUS on the short side only so if you get hook and want to keep you will be on the major trend side

--- 帖子 #767 ---
There is nice up trend and wait for the pull back

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Comming down now I only use CCI oscillator 5, 14, 68 to drive my trade and the personnal feeling

--- 帖子 #769 ---
hi are you getting good spread on the wildies?? that's the only reason I don't trade them.. the best I seen is 3pips on gbz.. anything over 1 for scalping is too much imo.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Not to bad , but you make a nice run too on GBJP.... My wildies : is NZUS going down for the long run and GBNZ going up to 2.0000 and from there reverse the trade, NZ 8150 before reverse So i hope i will be scalping for the next few months on those pullback before reverse the trend.. Some PPL says one months and half for GBNZ to reach the target

--- 帖子 #771 ---

This month is my discipline month. I'm out for the day with either a 15pip gain, or 2 losses, or 2 gains, or 11Am est. Today was +17pips with 2 gains. and am not feeling bad about what the "could have been" was. so folks you did good trading on the 1st of the month on a Monday, which are normally ugly.

I start 3h. ago and i get cut by telecom worker for the final connection on optical wire, living far from Montréal ( 1 h. ) where the next F1 Race next week end. I open 7 trades on NZUS and GBNZ and all are in positive side and just close one NZ with 5$ in Bank. I lost 3 h and lucky nothing to bad happen. At ,05 lot size i can take many trades and balance the exit and enter.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
I think i will keep one GBNZ for the long run from 1,97980 to 1,98150 now. NZUS make a leg down and maybe keep on trade for the long run too

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Open 2 trades on Silver... one at 18,783 and ,764 Maybe the bottom .... If not i keep longer because in june we are in the Golden Season

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Out of GBNZ and NZUS one 13,36 and 13,00 cannot see big positive money better in Bank now... My silver look good now and if there is a big fast move up i will close one

Open 2 trades on GBUS ,05 lot each and my leverage is 1:50

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Close my 2 GBUS trades for 17,75$ That it for today with 76,75$ in Bank I should stay more longer on GBNZ but no regret and the money in my pocket

I take 2 other trades on GBNZ 1,98570 - 1,98471 Maybe to early....

I want to show you guys something very funny and sad at the same time.. look when my stop loss is and where it has taken me out due to either a broker platform technical problem or straight up fucking client in the you know what by some crazy news spread widening of 50+. This was just the icing on the top after everything that went wrong yesterday. all i have to say or do is this .. of course a complaint is made lets see what they do about it. but know this that no matter what your at the mercy of these guys at anytime. anyhow that is why you keep your small account with these guys.

ya, but a good looking one, lol Here is what I do foxy.. I sleep about 5-6 hours day from around after lunch to evening.. then I hit the gym for lite work out, swim and steam sauna before heading back for a nice dinner.. and then I am ready to battle the beast. .. and I never miss my two massage session per week from my Swedish babe.. the best part of my work out perhaps . .. oh ya jot this down you all.. too much sleep is for losers.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Maybe you could have done with a little more sleep?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
nonsense.. foxy getchhh yo facts straight.. I haven't even taken a trade today, lol.. all that loss is due to that crazy broker garbage.. and if i was up I would have been out of that trade before the spike or stop set at about 10 pips, about 4% loss. but I admit i have been the worst trader in the world for the past couple of months when it comes down to this particular account... at least no one can't say I am not transparent .

--- 帖子 #815 ---
I guess I must be a loser then . By the way, I'm not blond or 6ft tall (or wide)

Hey DerBerliner, If you don't really believe what you said, then try it for yourself. If you really do believe what you said then you must by all means go somewhere else.

Hi everyone. which broker u use for scalping ? I know it's ECN account.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
The answer to your question is.. Partically yes.. I have all kinds of trades going on in this account that why I announce the ones that are scalps. however I like for you to think this a losing system and move the fook on.. with all due respect, lol

--- 帖子 #823 ---
are you asking me?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
I was asking everyone including u ​

--- 帖子 #825 ---
MBTrading, they have free ECN, meaning they don't charge commissions only normal spreads which are low. good luck

--- 帖子 #826 ---
I say this out of care.. If you can not on your own search or find a scalping suitable broker, then I suggest stay away from scalping till you do.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Due to my recognition as I see more life into the market I will look for higher R scalps this week and longer if conditions matches.. perhaps holding longer to reach potential profits when maximum risk is minimal or free riding. based on that I got 4 trades going on so far.. two taken yesterday and two today.. taking them for a reverse or at least a band to band play. short cadjpy 94.057 short audchf 0.83956 long euraud 1.45118 long gbpaud 1.79400

Ok still working on my trading discipline.

Is Scalping as a Trading Strategy Suited for Everyone?? There is a great deal of confusion when it comes to the topic of scalping. The allure of fast paced trades, and even faster money is a great pull to new and experienced Forex traders alike. To determine whether we should be scalping or not we must first define what scalping really means. Scalping is the action of taking many short term intra-day trades with the intention of only holding the trade for a few minutes. Those who scalp the forex market may only look for a very small take profit, capitalizing on moves smaller than 20 pips more often than not. While this forex trading strategy may present many viable trading opportunities, is it really in our best interest to scalp the forex market? The Stress Of Forex Scalping Strategies Often a traders mental ability is the determination between a successful forex trader and one that ends up never mastering the art of forex trading. With this in mind it is important to eradicate as much stress from your trading as possible. One very simple way to do this is to take less trades by using slightly longer time frames. Taking fewer trades will allow you more time to process fully your reason for entering the trade, your trade management and finally your exit strategy. Forex scalping strategies at their very core rely on executing many trades per day. This fast paced trading style increases the level of stress a trader will experience exponentially. Not only are you forced to enter many trades per day, you are also in a position where these trades need to be closed quickly as well. For someone new to the forex market this is a recipe for disaster. This fast paced style leads to chasing markets, missing signals, and more often than not revenge trading. The Effect Of Spread On The Forex Scalper There is always a difference between the price you can buy a currency pair and the price at which you can sell it…this is called the spread. More often than not spread is never even a thought in the mind of aspiring forex traders. I use the word “aspiring”, as already profitable forex traders always take into account the effect spread has on their overall profit or loss. Let’s use an example to better illustrate the effect of spread. 5 Trades Per Day X 3 Pip Spread = 15 Pips Paid In Spread Per Day! 15 Pips Per Day X 5 Trading Days = 75 Pips Paid In Spread Per Week! 75 Pips Per Week X 50 Trading Weeks = 3,750 Pips Paid In Spread Per Year! If we use 20 pip stops and risk 1% per trade that means every 20 pips we make or lose we will have gained or lost 1%. 3,750/20 = 187.5% Paid In Spread!!! Is spread starting to become a little more important in your eyes? If you simply cut the amount of trades you take in half you will save yourself +93.75% or 1,875 pips! Now this is a very broad example of how spread can accumulate and cut into your overall profit but it illustrates a clear point of how spread can accumulate over the course of time. Spread is the cost of doing business as a forex trader, but like any other business we can cut costs and become a more streamlined business. Some companies use energy efficient light bulbs, as traders we “cut the light bill” by becoming more selective with the trades we take. Controlling Your Risk Our single job as a forex trader is to control risk. If you think about anything and everything we do it is done to control risk and eliminate it to the best of our ability. With that being said lets examine spread in relation to scalping. As an example lets say we bought the GBP/USD from 1.6000 with a 10 pip stop loss and a 7 pip take profit. If we are trading the Pound that means there is usually a 3 pip spread. Therefore in order for us to get filled at 1.6000 we would have had to have bought when the price (the bid) was at 1.5997 As a result the market would have had to only move 7 more pips down to hit our 10 pip stop loss. On the other side of the trade the market would have to move a full 10 pips to hit our 7 pip take profit! This is a very important point to think about. With the example above we are risking 10 pips to make 7. Not only that but the market only has to move 7 pips to hit our stop loss, while it has to move a full 10 pips to hit our take profit! The spread works against you all the time, but as you can see the smaller your take profit and stop loss the more of an effect a pairs spread will tend to have. Another way to look at that is the spread is actually 30% of the entire profit target. That’s like running a business with a flat 30% fee on top of every sale! No one in their right mind would open a business that operated like this, but yet many jump into scalping without giving it a second thought. One of the most simplistic ways of controlling risk is with a positive risk to reward ratio. Plain and simple, if you risk more than you look to receive on your trades you will eventually wipe out your account. There is no exception to this rule, it always comes true! A positive Risk/Reward ratio is something that is very difficult to achieve when scalping in the forex market because of spread. Breaking Your Scalping Addiction If you love to trade short term how can you still fill that desire but yet avoid the main pitfalls of scalping. First you need to understand that the satisfaction of turning a consistent profit far out weighs any rush you will ever experience from scalping. Our goal is to turn a profit and if the trading strategy we put to use is failing us, then its time to put it aside. I urge you to step back away from the charts and stop trading for a few days or a week. Give some consideration to the points brought forth here especially if you scalping is resulting in consistent loses.

Hi… I have not been active much here but will be for the last a few weeks of the year. My activity will be based on combination of scalping tactics presented in this thread and some BO plays.. and get to talk some trades with fellow traders. Basic idea behind all my scalping is to spot momentum, make timely entry and ride it for a small gain and repeat the same all day to reach satisfying positive income. sometimes a breakeven day is well satisfying considering the day at hand and other times 80+ is not enough.. it all depends in a life of a scalper. I am mostly focused on just a few major pair’s such as eu/gu/uj/ej for their cheap spread/commission, reasonable volatility and reliable movement. I will be zoomed on achieving pips, more pips at lower risk per trade off aggressive entry tries for target of 50+ daily goal. I hope to see old faces back as well as new faces joining me for the year end stretch. I will post live trades and welcome you to do the same. See you on Monday, mean time I post some of my trades from last week especially Friday was a great day for some Pullback trades as I have already posted in my journal. I will post my day end results in my journal. empire

--- 帖子 #839 ---
I really like this ej trade which actually made my week for getting +40 out of it which is almost about 4 times of what i normally get.. it was a last little straight bear move of the week. The way market has been I look to spot more of such trades by getting on off the pullback from nice steps plays where it has momentum behind it.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
same deal on uj for the short trade as it is correlated with ej at times... the long trade was not too bad either earlier.. normally it takes many more trades and tries to reach 50+ for the day but sometimes is like a walk in the park which makes up for the grinding days and agonies, lol... thats scalping.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Hey!! welcome back FXEmpire! I see your trading the 15m and 30m. Do you still trade the 5m? Keep posting, I"m In.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Hi sparrow.. nah I just take it down from where ever i see momo building up, could be from 1m to 1hr. i will post pic from 5m in this thread, those were snap shots from my journal I dragged over here. good to hear from you... how are you doing trading wise? what are you trading these days?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
I'm doing Ok over all, great on trendy and counter trendy days. I've been trading anything having an 7 day average daily range of 100 pips and a low spread. EU, GU mostly. I only trade 8:00 till 11:00 est and a lot of the resent activity has been in the afternoons. I've added "Market profile" to my charts and use the Value area hi/lo and the median like one might use the daily Pivot lines. I have the notion that it's good to know where the big boys are playing. Particularly for over bought and oversold reversal opprotunitities.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
sounds good brother, glad to hear you doing well, keep it up.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
took stab at long uj early on off the PB cautiously though.. that is why i exited for -3 when it was not there atm.. perhaps the PB was a bit too strong and faded the bull momo.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
took shot at ej and eu long.. very slow moving atm so settle for what i could, so +4 on each.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
small gain out of ej again good for +6.. it's a damn grind today barely cracking over 10, lol.. not much momo to get more our of these trades in a timely manner..

--- 帖子 #848 ---
long on uj for +11 off the PB.. it took me all day to get to above +10.. so this considers as a good start..

--- 帖子 #849 ---
abo.. everything is been laid out so please due diligence and study the many charts... not need for English there bud. good luck.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
The reason why I don't play hard tight stop such as 5pips and aggressive TS. This is today's eu chart... as you see earlier today eu broke out of it's days low and pulled back and resumed for a possible bear run... at point B is where the logical short entry should be.. breakout, PB and then signs of resume.. as you see i got in and banked +10... but whats important is that I would have been sting pretty nicely if I had used a 5 pips hard stop.. point C is where it would have taken me out by a few 10th of pips before heading down... so flexible exit would give the necessary breathing room for the trade. and now the quick TS play to +5 argument is also most time would be taken out... point D move is where it would have taken your +5 out before giving it any chance of life.. and point F move would have taken out the BE stop a little later if the trade had been left to run large. some of my followers had asked me about and thought to illustrate a live example, thats all.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
nice little counter trade on ej for about +20.. I feel a PB coming so if it does i can get back on the ride on the resume...

--- 帖子 #852 ---
oh boy am i glad close this one or what... it turned like there is no tomorrow... I wanted to keep it a bit longer to see the reaction to the roundi 147.000 and also the last recent high on the left... but it was near enough and losing ground already and double profit amount of what i normally shoot for.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
nice work. i like scalp in any low tf. let me have a try this yours.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
ej long off the pullback good for +35.. nice straight shoot up on a u.s bank holiday.. cracked the 147.000 this time but look to be slowing down for another PB probably.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
gu long good for +24.. picking the bottom in this case like the 1st version presented in this thread.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
closed a long EU trade before the ism news good for +30.. earlier shorted as my first trade of the day/week a quick clean one for +18 both PB trades...

--- 帖子 #857 ---
gu moved nicely for masses.. PB's..

--- 帖子 #858 ---
A MACD set @ 12:26:9 ? and not 6:14:0 ?

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Sometimes I plot the default one when i go for larger gains to see the trend quickly when flipping through pairs.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
long on ej currently from 147.601.. looking for small scalp.. lets see how i shapes out..

--- 帖子 #861 ---
thats what the ej trade looks now... it gave me a bit of cushion .. so I closed in on the stop.. if it's hit, oh well -2 loss at most but if it runs its good for about 20 unless it gets wild... the point is its low risk.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
kick out at -2... just can't make it with ej today.. 4tries and all got stuck in the mud after lil move.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
eu and ej short off PB good for +15 +20.. same deal on gu currently still alive inside some profit..

--- 帖子 #864 ---
gu short out for +8... a bit of a premature exit probably but I took it safe and banked a good for the hour, overall speaking. eu and ej are setup nicely for another PB short trade if gives a valid pullback and resume.. will see, i am gunning for it..

--- 帖子 #865 ---
took shot at eu short PB setup again, but was messing around so exited for a small loss -4.. but it resumed.. it happens.. same deal on UJ..

--- 帖子 #866 ---
buy counter play of the bottom good for small +8 profit.. same play was available on ej without full confirmation for as it did not hit the bottom firm enough for me.. nevertheless it was a winner good for +15..

--- 帖子 #867 ---
scalping the eu bracket band to band for some profit..

--- 帖子 #868 ---
couple of short Pb trades on eu post ny open when PA freed up from the little bracket it was in.. good for total of +30.. good day of scalping for about +90.. could have got some more as I took a longer break than usual middle of LO session.. it's very tiring the way I do this, it's a constant monitoring, focus and concentration.. tough on mind and body when doing it for 8-10 hours a day.. I am sure true scalpers can relate.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
gu good for +20 earlier.. same play again.. self explanatory chart..

--- 帖子 #870 ---
2nd try failed as i choose to take 5 pips loss.. still up 15 pips on this sequence... perhaps was pressing it on the second try and that is why 10 or 5 was the most i was willing to give away.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
all the analysis in the world is all fine and dandy, but gotta have a leash on it.. yep, "Negative Control" is the name of the game..

Today and tomorrow market is awaiting on some major news release from ecb for eu and nfp for dollar... more than likely before the release of each market will not move much and that is why i would look for bounce plays more than anything else.. so PB plays are more appropriate for after the release. for example eu is inside 30 pips range.. just made a little 30 pips bull move and it has pulled back for a PB signal.. but i reject it as I am more keen to take the short bounce based on it's reaction to the HH.. the chart: the small box is the zone i would have taken the buy PB trade on a normal circumstances... the rectangle zone is HH and expected failure perhaps a nice DT to go short on the red arrow. as you see PB trade would have been a struggle atm... and that's good enough for scalper to bail out of a trade and wait for whole new setup.. anyhow, who knows anything could happen...

Solid Pullback opportunities after nfp.. good job numbers strengthen the dollar and a PB trade was high probable for another push to at least it highest point.. and that all we look for on pb trades... although I held on a bit longer to see if it breaks loose for a lot more gain and gave up some pips for doing so but it was worth it due to very positive release impact.

good start to the week.. ej short of the PB good for +20..

eu short PB play same as ej good for +22... I held this one a bit longer to get more but did not happen strongly as i wanted, so stay greed safe and bank

this was a nfp play on a much lower lot size which i hoped it would run big but just decided to close it for +45.. most likely now it would take out my stop at BE before and IF making another bear leg..

recent eu trades.. long reverse play for +20.. same swing going for a PB losing -2..

short uj PB trade +20.. I am still kicking myself for missing the previous two PB trades on this pair today, would have put me well over 100 today already... it has move perfectly for selling the dips like we do here..

--- 帖子 #879 ---
uj short PB trade +20... this pair has been just awesome today..

--- 帖子 #880 ---
just a little quick scalp for +5 off M1.. same concept, steps/PB normally i go for +3 on M1, taking advantage of the 1st quick burst and be done to only do it again and again, since there will be so many opportunities in a single day..

eu long for another PB trade +20 and my last one of the day.. this was a great day for pullback type trading, nice daily range of 100+ pips with making dips and swing out right after, hopefully rest of December would like this to finish the year off strong for everyone who trades the same.

early PB trades... eu long and uj short... same plays but got unfortunate with uj, bastard nailed me with -10 before dropping large right after... but eu worked great for +27..

--- 帖子 #443 ---
took shot at uj long as i smelled a little divergence coming in with extra care.. it had a early go then quickly faded so exited for BE.. i get this suckaa later..

gu long PB trade out for -2... defense.. not willing to give much back..

--- 帖子 #445 ---
quick +10 ej long PB stuff.. I was looking for a firm strong break of that recent high, but it did the opposite and bounced, so i rather bank the decent gain..

--- 帖子 #446 ---
eu long PB trade for +12... it seems to having trouble breaking the earlier high..

--- 帖子 #447 ---
gu short PB trade out -3... i don't let it breath once i think there is no momo at the time of my entry..

--- 帖子 #448 ---
eu long PB play good for +17 and will give more probably but was satisfying enough for me..

--- 帖子 #449 ---
long gu reverse play good for +15.. I liked to make double that amount on this play but stated to mess around at around 20 pips, so banked.. can't let the market to decide for you all the time, be in control of your own destiny.. a slow grinding day is truing for better hopefully... still got nys coming
