Hi guys, My interest in finance started when I was thirteen. Started messing around with options then stocks but ultimately the FX market fit my style. Today I am 27 years old and I have been through the ups and downs. You will never learn to win if you don't learn to loose. The best advice I could give is that you need to find your own style of trading. DO NOT follow systems you find on the internet including here. Learning has been very hard to say the least. The first chance I had to trade real money required me to save for two years (~$30,000) and I lost it all in about two months. This was after high school. Now that I am about to graduate college I will work doing what I do best, trade! I feel I have mastered reading supply and demand after years and years of tireless sleepless nights and days watching price action. The name of the game is to recognize supply and demand. My method for doing this requires multi-time frames. I prefer to use 15 min, 240 min, and daily. Apply any oscillator of your choice (mine: stochastics RSI) to each of your windows. (Never trade against the direction of an oscillator in a monthly chart, this is your trend). Longer time frames give you the market's trend. So if your monthly is bullish look for discrepancies in your lower time frames. If your daily if bullish look for discrepancies within your smaller time frames. Discrepancies within the small time frames equals quick opportunities while discrepancies within larger time frames like the 4 hour and above equal big moves in the direction of the larger time frames (daily, weekly, or monthly). This is how I determine the direction prices will take. My profit factor is over 400, I am perfect so far in my long positions, and have had only one minimal loss that is technically a win, use limit orders people Average profit=over $1000 Average loss (my only loss)=$160 I started with a $70,000 account in October, currently just above $150,000. You will see October is my smallest gain, just remember I am a full time student and have little time to trade.

I do not see any trading system nor anything new in your message!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Tell me to delete the post and I will, no problem.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I think a better idea than deleting the thread would be adding a description of your system, or at least adding some new concept, theory or your findings here...

How can we find supply and demand

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Impressive !!! please educate us.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Are we all reading the same thing? Investing101 has just told everyone how his system works, he just didn't spoon feed anyone because you need to adapt what you like to your own style. Use an oscillator that you like, that fits your style, the indicator isn't as important as the price action :-)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Exactly use the oscillator just to see the strength of the move in the direction it moves in. If it is a weak move against the trend of the oscillator in a bigger time frame then enter the trade in the direction of the longer time frame trend. There is weak demand in a bullish oscillator that showed no strength in price movement, if the bigger time frame is going in the opposite direction. Now if the larger time frame reached an overbought or oversold territory move on to the next bigger time frame and wait until the previous overbought or oversold time frame becomes overbought or over sold again and judge strength of the move by seeing how quickly it reached that territory and if the next bigger time frame is still going in the opposite way. Seeing how price reacts to an oscillator and comparing it to a bigger time frame will tell you whether there is demand or supply. I use the following time frames, 15 minute, 60 minute, 240 minute charts. Use big time frames like the daily or weekly to see the overall trend of the oscillator. Don't ever take a position against the direction of the monthly chart unless it is in oversold or overbought territory and prices seem to be consolidating.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
There has to be more to this show us your entry points or soemthig.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Notice I have big draw downs on occasions. To solve this pick your entry in a small time frame. I would do it just that I am in College and don't have time to pick the entry efficiently. Either way sufficient buying power keeps me safe because I know what direction we are going in. See attachment below.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
You can also take a look at my previous posts I made on the EURUSD thread and tell me how accurate my predictions were?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
How do we find supply and demand though

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks..excellent post

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This is a very basic example of what investing means..correct me if im wrong, including the entry on the 15M and direction following on the monthly Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

How long you usually stay in trades for to I seen you took 60

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Depends on the timeframe I choose to base my trade in.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Choose an oscillator with a faster period. You don't have to put it over the chart like I did but I find that it helps. Go to the daily or weekly chart to confirm the trend and the direction of the oscillator. Below is the 4 hr chart. The trend has been down for the last few months so look at what happens when the oscillator looks overbought and a much higher time frame's oscillator is still heading down. Notice how many of the oscillations below looks bullish when in reality the price action did not follow through as the oscillator did. It is screaming SELL No Demand! Refer to a higher time frame to see when it reaches an oversold territory, I usually multiply the current time frame by 4 to find my reference. Below you see a 4 hr chart so you would reference the daily chart. If the daily chart reaches oversold territory wait for a pullback of the oscillator and see how price reacted to the move of the oscillator so if now the daily reaches overbought territory reference the trend with a higher time frame weekly. Sort of like a domino effect. https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7544/...bffba18d_o.jpg

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thanks, I think what Investing is saying is whatever the timeframe youre using as your main entry, always look on a higher timeframe direction and then take trades in that direction on your lower timeframe once your oscillator shows that its overbought/sold (and its reached your supply or demand level), this way the movements of the trade you enter will be safe and better, bigger pips.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
What's some good oscillators

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Any of the common, I use stochastic rsi inputs: rsiLenght 8, stoclength 8, wmalenght 8

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Yeah as an example, Your 15 minute chart, 240 min chart, and daily are open in your screen. "I prefer to have multiple time frames up to see things live" 1. So say the the 15 minute is oversold, and the 240min/daily are still going down and not in oversold territory 2. Wait for the 15 minute chart's oscillator to reach overbought territory "pullback" and you will notice if there is any demand for the currency based on how price moves along with the oscillator. You will notice that if larger timeframes are still going down, and the oscillator in the 15 minute chart is reaching overbought territory "going against the major trend" price will not move at the same pace as its oscillator because there is NO DEMAND, so sell! 3. You will notice that an up move on the oscillator on the 15 minute chart had NO affect on the downward oscillators in the higher time frames.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
How is news with this

--- 帖子 #23 ---
You could avoid trading news or trade based on higher time frames. I can't remember the last time I followed news reports, frankly I am too busy to care about news so I trade based higher time frames. The results are based on not caring what news or analysts say and focusing on demand and supply. Yeah some news made my account volatile sometimes but it is only temporary. My advice would be to either avoid news or have enough buying power so the trade comes back to you.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I hear that man I'm going look into to look like you have had great returns

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Can you provide your trading detail history so we can exam the day/time with it's RSI? How you determine the exit point for each trade? Thx for your valuable infor.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
He already gave you the details of his system, what more could you want from him? All the information that you need is already there. This is essentially the same system I use and it makes me wonder where he got his information from?! Be sure not to say too much dude! Some of these folks just need to figure it out themselves and learn the hard way. Then, of course, there are other "folks" (I hate using this word, it reminds me too much of Obama) who will never get it even though the information is staring at them right in the face and couldn't be laid out any clearer. No offense, investing 101, but you're doing just fine. Keep that rate of return up for a few more months and you'll have money managers calling you begging to take their money, hahahaha. Semi-kidding. I think you should stop posting here and go back to what you do best: TRADE Let the goons be goons.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Firstly, thank you investing101 for your information it has been very much appreciated. SECONDLY Who do you think you are smash1820 - If you are such a good trader why are you here wasting your time and abusing those who are learning. I say its time you leave. As you are the only GOON here.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thank You! subscribed

--- 帖子 #29 ---
investing 101, kindly please share your Stoch RSI indicator. Many Thanks!

--- 帖子 #30 ---
here..

--- 帖子 #31 ---
This is why successful traders such as myself do not bother to post anything on Forex Factory. The trader has not had a chance to even develop the thread and is already hit by a negative comment from a probable know-it-all.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
well you just did, so that makes you unsuccessful, lol anyhow this thread does not belong in trading system section, unless she offers details of some which is required for system section.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Good one. lol

--- 帖子 #34 ---
My point sir is, you don't learn by following other people's system. You do that you will loose eventually. The name of the game is finding weaknesses in supply or demand. Learn to loose/don't give up and you will find your own style. I have hundreds of thousands of hours invested just in watching price action.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Exits, I just take money as I go. Technically I have left a lot of money on the table for not sticking to the trend. Even though I have like 60 trades on that report I could have made a lot more money with 3 trades just by sticking to the trend. When I start doing this full time, once I am in a trade I will go to the next higher time frame and wait till it is overbought or oversold.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
now i see what you are saying thanks i shall demo this

--- 帖子 #37 ---
many successful trading systems are based on identifying and following the long term trend, then using pullbacks or breakouts on lower TF's to enter (including my own) What 101 has provided here is a very simple way of doing this. I'm sure if any trader spends time to become comfortable with it then they can become profitable.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I like the way to view overbought/oversold line in a chart instead of in an indicator window, therefore just find one similar to yours. I hope this will help whoever who wants same success in forex like you. Thx

--- 帖子 #39 ---
FXyao, thanks but i think Stocahstic and Stoch RSI is different.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I have compared the same date ranges between them and it shows almost same figure. test it by yourself.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Excellent Yao, Thank you.. I was searching online on how to do this

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Santos, ur welcome. I like the achievement of investing101 and people can follow the same way and show their success story. I deeply believed that the success can be copied. Just follow the smart leader -- investing101.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
FXYao, thanks! how do you enter your trade with this? I can see even if its OB already but the price still strongly going up.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Mario, you need to know if you are in a supply or demand area too.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This is an excellent way to trade, I make similar intraday trades lasting no more than a few hours for 50 or so pips and sometimes even more which depends on the market. Fact is investing101 has shared some key important points and if traders prefer such approach do [re]read investing101 previous posts to figure out what exactly [s]he was trying to convey...and don't be too indicator-centric.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Very nice strategy.. Thanks for sharing.. Could you elaborate on the money management.. I.e. what is the lot size u use for every 1000$.. What about the stoploss and profit booing methods.. either trailing stop or fixed TP..Thanks..

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Agreed, you have to read his method for many times to get an idea of macro view + micro action, I believed following entry points were by investing101 in September. Thx

--- 帖子 #48 ---
.....it will be good to see the corresponding exit points to appreciate his trades better.....can you follow up with that ?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
101; Just an idea to determine the entry and exit points by the cross of fast+slow RSIs for your consideration, I hope someone know mql language can program it so that the robot can trade by itself, we only need to set our comfortable percentage 30/70%? of overbought/sold territory and direction of the trade. By the territory robot picks the entry and exit. Please post your test result if you apply this method so everyone can benefit it. thx

--- 帖子 #50 ---
You don't even have to wait for the cross. Notice how bullish the stochastic was yet price didn't react the same way, NO DEMAND. When you enter the trade just make sure a time frame that is 4 times bigger is still going down.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Notice how it would be difficult to judge when to enter a short trade considering not all the oscillations get a high. Say you are trading that 4 hour chart you have there. You notice that the oscillator is becoming overbought so you get ready to enter a short trade but you want a precise entry. Divide your 4 hour chart by four and you get a 60 minute chart. Head over to an hourly chart and as soon as that one is overbought enter your short trade.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
That chart is a 4hr chart, enter short and exit when it becomes oversold. Wait for the pullback of the oscillator and if price reacts weakly to a pullback of the oscillator enter short again.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Dear 101; Very sorry, do not quite understand the last sentence. Can you provide a graph to show "When you enter the trade just make sure a time frame that is 4 times bigger is still going down"? thx very much.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Can we use 30min tf as well to get the entry point? I thought you mention you prefer 30mintf to trade. 4h tf is just to make sure there is a trade change. thx

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I think i got your idea, thanks 101..

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I use multiple time frames. What time frames you use doesn't really matter, just don't make them to small because small times don't reflect supply and demand. 15 minute charts are the lowest you should use. So say you do go with a 15 minute chart. I would have the following charts open too, 60 minute chart and the 240 minute chart. The 15 minute chart represents your trigger while your larger time frames are your trend. Exits will be quicker with lower times frames and therefore if you use higher time frames like a 240 minute, daily, and weekly you can bet on big moves.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
101; When you "enter short again", do you use the same lot size or smaller? what the sl do you place? thx

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thank you very much, i understood this fully.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Dear 101; Do you consider this is an uptrend on the EURUAD monthly/weekly chart? thx

--- 帖子 #60 ---
when your large time frames like the monthly are overbought or oversold you will have consolidation usually. Now overbought or oversold situations in large time frames like the monthly also represent change in trend "coming soon". You will get explosive moves if the trend does change. I have found it still safe to trade in the direction of the original trend as long as no major news comes out. So rule of thumb for me would be definitely pay attention to news releases (don't trade) when large timeframes are in overbought or oversold territory. If no news releases are scheduled then it is safe to keep trading in the direction of the original trend. So in this case, if the monthly is looking like it is close to a reversal go to a daily chart and still short the currency if it is overbought.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Now notice how we are at a decisive moment. EURUSD has bounced off the 1.22 level since 2008 three times already and this is the 4th try. I don't think we are going to break it considering there is no supply starting to show (monthly oscillator is oversold and has no steam left to break the triple bottom. This month's candle should be rocky, next month's candle I might be thinking it is time to go long. Now that I look at it mark my words that around the time crude oil stabilizes and rises the EURO will look mighty again. I am expecting this to happen come January/February.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
investing 101, how about using MA instead of oscillator? Do you think it still works? I find the same principle with 3 ducks trading system in BP.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Mario, it might be a good indicator, but we need to backtesting to see which one is better. Can you provide a picture of 3 ducks trading system in September so we can estimate number of earned pips between them? To my point of view 101 RSI provides more trading chances than MA. may be MA can make more pips. who knows.. thx

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Smash, This one of the many reasons I like your style. Right on right on.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I agree.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Investing101, Very helpful &amp; informative info your sharing.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
My original point was that I found my method of trading and it should be unique for each one of us. When you focus on demand and supply who gives a shiXXT about what news is coming up tomorrow or what geopolitical stuff is happening. On another note, I constantly see people doing backward testing on methods. Those don't work!!! I belief that trading is 1% technical and 99% pure psychological. Trading is a whole different animal when you use real funds (99% psychological). The odds of being on the right side of the trade is 50/50 then why do traders/hedge funds go bust?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Yeah you helped me I was looking at supply and demand trying learn it already

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hey smash point me to your system I am intrigued. I want to compare.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi, Can you share the stochastic RSI you're using? The default ones in my MT4 (Stochastic) asks only for K Period, D period and Slowing and draws multiple lines.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Do you agree on the movement yao?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
look at the daily chart on your charts, looks overbought already. I would say still take shorts for quick profits. Look at the monthly chart you posted and go back to 1 Jan 2010, look at what happened even as the monthly was oversold. Now look at the 1 Jan 2010 on the daily and you will see it was overbought even as the monthly chart looked oversold which is why the monthly stayed oversold for a period of time.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
How do I put it on my chart instead of at the bottom

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I see yes.. monthly moves muchh slower on the oscilator

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I would wait to we close this month. Then decide what the EURUSD will be doing.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
In MT4, go to File/Open Data Folder/, go to temples, then copy the downloaded template to this folder. go back to your chart, right click in the chart and a pop-up window will be shown, then just follow the steps.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I can see the idea of 101, EURUSD should be SHORT tomorrow. His way of seeing trend is becoming fairly clear to me. Thx 101 for ur great contribution.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
If you are a scalper and be able to sit in front of the computer, I felt that using smaller tf + supply and demand this method can also bring you extra $.

Me too now..seems easier to understand now. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Santos, look like the chart is coming from your smartphone? What is the name of the program? I like to have it too. thx

The only commodity that is not about supply and demand is the Air we breathe in order to live. Every and anything else is always about supply and demand.................. GS.

Hmm well you might be wrong..aint the trees that supply the air for us to breathe?

Its normal to be wrong as the demand of being right from people like you is always there...hence the plentiful supply of being wrong..... GS

i wonder why most of newbie trader make a Demand/Supply as a technique that need to develop.. Demand/Supply is not technique.. It is a "concept" Mostly failed to adapt this theory...wth..

At least rsi+demand/supply works so far for eurusd, it drops almost 45 pips since gmt+7, still counting..

for android try this https://play.google.com/store/apps/d...es.metatrader4

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Iphone.. but might be available for android too.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I find supply and demand to be the reality of how markets work. I tried indicators in the past and also indicators along with supply and demand but wasn't successfull. I find ONLY USING PRICE without indicators the best way to trade. It takes a while to understand in your own way how to read the supply/demand areas but after you "get it" it really simple and straightforward.

Took profit, working on a short entry. Profit factor just went from a 400 to over 500

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Guys you see, everything in the big time frames was overbought, even with the spike to over 1.247 it came falling like a ton of bricks. Would have been a big payday if I shorted that again!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
suscribed, what oscillator would you recomend as the best? from what i saw you use stochastic, any particular number sequence?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi all Don't laugh at me. I am a beginner .I lost a lot of money following RSI, ADX and the like. Until now I can't get it practicaly in details . I don't know what is meant by the oscillator in the direction of the trend. does it mean the oscillator in in over bought or oversold zones and the price isn't going down or up, or the direction of the oscillator line is the in the direction of the trend. Is it possible that some body please make that clearer preferably in video or clear pictures. I was reading about supply and demand zones using info from SamSeiden and Elfonso. The method presented by Invester101 is very simple compared to what I had read about . My gratings to Investor101 and many thanks for his generosity and for you all for participating in this forum to help others.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
The short version of the first post of this thread, and the one that will probably be glossed over by most new traders. All it takes is.... years and years of tireless sleepless nights and days watching price action

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Thanks For your help . I was struggling years not just now. But couldn,t get the one system that helpped me . I think you and many people learn from each others. If you are not willing to help others I think will do. If you live long enough you find all sort of people this is life my friend.

CISCO, Your absolutely right my friend. I couldn't have said better myself. For me this is simplicity at its best.

101; Sadly I placed tailing stop loss after reaching over 50 pips, but the news raised it to 1.247x and touched my new stop loss. therefore I only got few pips in the end. How you determine your stop loss? What is the percentage of lot size comparing to your total asset? Also I found out that using the cross of 2RSis to determine the exit point has lagging problem. Please advice. Thx.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
101; How many lot size do you placed to get $7000? If you entered eurusd at 1.2470 like me and exit 1.2430, then total number of pips is 40 pips. Do you placed you 17.5($7000/40pips) lots in one trade? Isn't it too risky since the money management that I learned is between 2-5% of the total asset? Thx.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Nice thread Investing... Just wanted to add my take on trading with this methodology. The first chart is a daily chart, showing a clear down trend based on the 50 EMA and I have chosen a section of the downtrend between the red vertical lines to take a look at. Now you can use the stoch and EMA combination on the weekly to determine overall trend and then look at the daily to see when the stoch and 50EMA agrees with the weekly trend. In this example the price is under the 50 EMA and the stoch is climbing into the overbought area on the stoch. On the daily chart you see the stoch is hitting the overbought area &gt;80 and has just broken lower. Once the daily is in line if you want to get the better entries and you have the time, you can drop to the 1hr chart. On the 1hr chart you see the first day I have blocked out in red, meaning this was the day the stoch turned down on the daily chart. At this point no one knows what price will do but the odds are in your favour to look for short entries. Look for price to retrace to the overbought area on the stoch you can enter. You can use just about any entry technique you like, candle formations, support/resistance, supply/demand or price divergence. A good entry is always preferable but with this methodology hitting the overbought area on the stoch is the main consideration to enter a trade. If your looking to have a stop loss of say 20, 30 or 50 pips and looking to gain 300 or 400 pips then you may be very disappointed using this methodology. I believe you will need larger SL as you are effectively trading the daily chart using the 1hr chart for entry. You have multiple entries on the 1hr chart over several days and it takes about 7 days for those entries to pay off. Patience is the key here! Hope this helps...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Dave; Based on your method, can you tell tomorrow eurusd will go up or down? My is probably up trend as below per here. 101, do you agree? thx

--- 帖子 #115 ---
This is PB trading right mates?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Not that much different to what I am doing with my swing trades using supply and demand levels. Just as you would get false breakouts of stochastic out of OB/OS areas, especially when stochastic can just hang in these areas for some time, I get false breakouts of higher time SD zones when looking at the bigger picture turning points. I like the way the op is comparing stochastic movement to price movement to determine direction, rather than the stochastic to determine direction alone. As stochastic is derived from price movement anyway, this is key imo.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
FXyao On the EUR Daily chart price is lust below the 50EMA and the stoch has reached the overbought area. I would stand aside until I see the stoch on the daily take a down turn and once that happens go to the 4hr or 1hr and start taking shorts when price retraces to the overbought area on the trading time frame. This methodology may not give you entries every day. The other thing to watch is price is starting to hit the support/supply area at 1.2200 on the weekly chart, multiple touches to that area.. Price may bounce higher before lower. If 1.2200 gets broken then the downside is open for a further fall.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Dave, eurusd reached 1.25200 from 1.2453 already. 101 method is topdown view and much simple. it does not mean it is 100 % accurate. thx

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Just be careful going long now as the daily stoch is overbought. You may want to wait for a pullback on the daily chart before you initiate a long position as this is the first real push to the up side in some time.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
yea, only short. thx

--- 帖子 #121 ---
FXyao That is not exactly what I said....but as always everyone needs to interpret the market in their own way.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Pullback on the 15 minute and short again.

My suggestion is that 101 method has proven 98.5% (64/65) success rate in his past transactions, there maybe a better method around having higher accuracy. But i like to practice/learn and become a skilled trader like him/her. thx

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Very happy for you, santos..

Im saying so if day is down and h4 down h1 down so would I wait for 30 minutes to be overbought then take it do

Yes and I need more practice to confirm my point. thx

101; Tomorrow usd is going to be affected by many important news, let's see how ur method will go. Since you have no time to answer my question about sl, i bet you might skip due to full confidence about ur method, am i right? What if what if. I am probably too conservative. thx

Just wanted to show everyone to be a bit cautious with the EUR. On the weekly chart we see the stoch is pointing up and just breaking the 20 level. We also have a support level at 1.2200 which appears to be holding for now. On the daily chart notice that we have a long term down trend with a very large price consolidation range forming over the last 2 months. So it is possible we may have a correction to the upside forming. On the daily chart we see that price is starting to run into the resistance area to the upside and the stoch is overbought, &gt;80, which means it is in alinement with the weekly stoch, but as it is overbought we may want to wait to see if we get a pullback and break of the resistance area before we consider a long trade. I, myself would like to see a break of the resistance area and a retest before a long entry, see the red lines for the price pattern. As Christmas is fast approaching this may take some time to form a on the daily chart.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Dave; I totally agreed with you, keep cautious all the time and better to try it on the demo account before actually applying it. There exists no 100% accurate trading, use it on your own risk and learn to correct it by the learned lesson. i am a beginner too. thx

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Bro investing 101, your ideas are quite logical and appreciable. Thanks for your contribution for us. I was wondering if any of our mates could help us by coding a simple MTF indicator like this, with value and colors indicating direction of the stochastic, and/or any other indicator along with it.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Sakib; this is a very good idea, may be add more function later on such as flag to enter/exit or even an EA robot. I only know simple mql language, but do not know where to get the rsi values from many tfs. there are lots of mql to learn. thx

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi FXyao I agree use a demo account or a small live account if you are a beginner. For the record, I've been trading Fx for quite some time. Just trying to assist people in reading the market.

Im still a little confused on the timeframes to go by, I like to take trades off the 15M most of the time, but im not sure what higher timeframe to look at. I look at 1H 4H and Daily but then i see other people mentioning others. one question: if im a day to day scalper on the 15m should i have the monthly up and worry about it? or is the daily and 4hr enough? thanks

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Santos; If i am not wrong, the idea is very simple. whatever tf you enter whatever tf you exit. say you use m15 as an indi to enter(actually use m1 or m5 to find the best place to real enter), then exit when near the cross of m15(same use m1 or m5 to find the best place to real exit). thx..

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Wow yao, thank you so much again my friend..I was doing it the other way around..looking at higher instead of lower

Interesting system, it´s my favourite oscilator. Summary: correct me if I´m wrong. -Basically you trade discrepancies,(corrections) in the direction of the monthly oscillator main direction. -It´s a trend follower. -The success is based on letting profits run on the higher TF oscillators. That´s all very good basic stuff. What I´m missing is a stop loss, and or trailing if any. Robots run the markets with their Algos and billions (literally).. Robots are specifically programed to look for "liquidity pools", (stop loss orders at obvious levels)...which get runned every day, no exception...before the original move resumes... To make it clear, you have a monthly, weekly, dayly agreement as per oscilator...you wait for the end of the retracement at the 240 min....the oscilator turns green...you (and the rest of the retail planet ), enter, with a stop below the last swing (??), the market moves up, comes back sharply, clears most sitting ducks and runs away.... The same happens with the trailing stops... Of course, if your system trails very wide stops, and waits for the end of the oscillator run on the higher TF, THEN , the big winners would upset (positively), the small loosers.. That´s what I´m missing in your statement: 17 trades , no loosers!! Thanks in advance for the answers...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
It is strange . All you guys speak about using price supply and demand, what we see here you are trading using indicators ,Stochastic and StochRSI. Trading supply and demand requires knowing supply and demand Zones.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Follow a major trend for starters. If an oscillator in a smaller time frame is going against the trend and price doesn't react as bullish or bearish to the oscillator then something is telling you their is no demand or there is no supply!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hello 101, What leverage do you use?

i use supply demand indicator, you can find here at ff want to learn more about it, look forward to your next post Regards, Tom

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Even thought the prediction was off by a day or two, see why I predicted 1.24. The recent run up was fueled by political stuff with no demand. Therefore it was eventually going to crash down.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
But trading in a smaller tf will have high chance to loss $$ because of many uncontrollable news. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi 101 Interesting thread here, pretty much like the way I trade day in day out, quick question....I see you have a good return but noticed there's been no mention of R:R or Stops etc, just wondered if you don't use them or just haven't mentioned them so far? Thanks

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Agree no RR no stops no trailing no losses?? Account doubled in a couple of months..... Is this dreamworld?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
If I base my entry on the 15 minute chart then go to a timeframe 4 times bigger (doesn't have to be 4 just bigger) and wait till that time frame is overbought or oversold. I stick to the trend so no stop loss for me just have enough buying power to sustain a position going against you.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Bam, under 1.24 as predicted.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
OK thanks 101 for confirming, I guessed as much, I don't have a problem with no stops as everyone's strategy is different and I respect that. I suppose when you talk about having enough buying power your referring to margin available based on your account leverage ? So sounds like your risk is low in comparison to the account balance. I've traded with and without stops, obviously you just have to accept draw down as probability says they are not all going to go in your favour, having done both I prefer to know my risk prior to entry and accept that I was wrong on my analysis that time around, however that's just my personal preference. Good job on the account growth

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Investor 101 I find determining the trend is sometimes confusing when there is price break up or break down . Can I use trend indicator like say Parabolic SAR ?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I find that if im taking trades on the 15 the 4HR seems much easier to follow than the 1HR.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
These three lines are sharing a lot of information about how to trade the investing101 way. Everyone will have his or her own way of trading Supply &amp; Demand, but this is about as simple as it gets. Investing101 said the indicators are not needed, but if they can help you to better understand, then use them. I do have the USD/JPY charts up with the Stochastic applied over the candles, but again this is not really need. Investing101 you have shared a very simple &amp; concise way of trading Supply &amp; Demand &amp; even though trading Supply &amp; Demand is not a new concept, you have added your own spin on how you are doing it &amp; it works. When you are done with your college education you should do very well in your trading career. It seems you are already very doing well, so it should only get better. Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi abofar; Put a 50 EMA on any Daily Chart if the Market is Above it then Bullish or Below it then Bearish if the Candles are breaking both sides of it with no clear direction then the Market is Consolidating. This a very simple way to determine Trend and as good as any other. Take a look at the image below it shows what is trying to be achieved.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hey.. Stevepatt, What are the setting for your above trend chart.. please....

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi Lex-Luther; It's just an image to demonstrate how the Intermediate and Short Term Trend interacts with the Primary Trend. This is what investing101 is doing, he finds the Primary Trend and then looks to trade the DIPS in a Bullish Market and the RALLIES in a Bearish Market by using the Stochastic Indicator to time his entries.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
hi investing101, i readen the thread, very interesting. I have a question about take profit, you mentioned in one post,, if you sell you take profit at oversold, but from which timeframe ? same that current timeframe where you are entry ? because on M15 tf i have only a few pips earned, so i'm asking me if is it not oversold from higher timeframe ? thx js

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Totally agreed, his method can be called trade optimization. Only buy one trade in a day on the average based on his record. I believed no other way can have this simplicity if u trade by day. The only risk is the selection on the top of major trend may not be the unique one, but he invented to pick the second top for lower the risk.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Modified a little bit. Someone knows mql language should develop a trade robot I hope i can do one. maybe later.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I'm sorry, but there's no trading report, only table made in excel, everybody can do the same without opening trading platform.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Eurusd is almost reaching to the bottom of daily, but 101 do not trade because of some risk. Waiting for the top to get in.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi Stevepatt It can't be more clearer. I do appreciate this help very much. Thank you very much. The problem oscillator does not have clear turning point ,when you enter or exit I find the oscillator start changing its mind about turning down if it is overbought , or turn up if it is oversold and the price reverse what did I do wrong here ?,

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Please trust him by studying his method more times, you will find it. thx

--- 帖子 #180 ---
All indicators are created after the event happened, there is no best one to be able to see future as i know. Choose whatever you like and trade. If you know better pleae share in here. thx

Another interesting thing is that the title says Supply &amp; Demand but the threat is totally different with bunch of indis while real S/D is about PA and guess where the supply /demand is watching the zones/candles.

True, regardless..it would be nice to talk more about supply and demand here. I think an up retracement before heading down first

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi abofar; As long as you understand the power of the image, that I posted, it will help with your trading progression. Another part of the puzzle is Market Structure this will be a big help with finding the Primary Trend. There's lots of information about this on Youtube/Google As FXyao said it's then a matter of trading that information with any additional Indicator(s) that you find useful. There is no substitute for screen and there's no short cut, unfortunately, to gain it other than by study. Take your time to find the type of Trader you want to be. Once you know, the type of Trader you want to be, you can concentrate all your time going in one direction without any distractions.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Extract from investing101's first post The name of the game is to recognize supply and demand. My method for doing this requires multi-time frames. I prefer to use 15 min, 240 min, and daily. Apply any oscillator of your choice (mine: stochastics RSI) to each of your windows. (Never trade against the direction of an oscillator in a monthly chart, this is your trend). Longer time frames give you the market's trend. So if your monthly is bullish look for discrepancies in your lower time frames. If your daily if bullish look for discrepancies within your smaller time frames. Discrepancies within the small time frames equals quick opportunities while discrepancies within larger time frames like the 4 hour and above equal big moves in the direction of the larger time frames (daily, weekly, or monthly). This is how I determine the direction prices will take. Hi santos; I thought the idea of the thread was to Trade with the Primary Trend, in this case the Daily, using the Stochs for timing.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Stevepatt It is really good to find people care about others (A friend In Need Is A Friend Indeed). Thank you very much for your advice. I am studying supply and demand using zones of supply and demand .It is much involved and there is rooms to make wrong decisions. Investor 101 method attracted me very much. I love to be able to master it. I am using Forex Tester 2 which I have just purchased. If no bother just help me in that line by suggesting things to do or articles to read or how can I practice applying this method. All the Best Abofar

--- 帖子 #188 ---
This is absolutely correct. Investing101 has said the indicators are not necessary. On the last chart you posted showing the 15M time frame did you trade the Stochastic cross on that one &amp; if so did you use another time frame to confirm the trade? Thank you for your response.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I agree. The indicators are not needed as investing101 has stated, but some may find them helpful. Thank you for the charts you have shared. From the last chart you posted is that what you looking at when entering a trade? I would appreciate it if you could share more of what you are doing to trade Supply &amp; Demand.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi acetrader; I don't Trade this way I was only trying to point out to santos how I thought investing101 was meaning this to be traded The mistake I made in the last chart, that I posted, was not waiting for the Stochastic on M15 to go "Overbought" before selling. I hate the term "Overbought" and "Oversold" because only the Market decides when it's not going to continue up or down not a Stochastic Indicator. I only Trade H4 and above using the Weekly Chart to find the Primary Trend and then Buy the Dips in a Bullish Market and Sell the Rallies in a Bearish Market. Post 170 I use Support/Resistance - Demand/Supply - Big Round Numbers - Round Numbers to look for the Price Action to take Trades with the Primary Trend at my back. It's basically the same as investing101 is doing here that's what got my attention with this thread.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I found this similar image online somewhere.. Attached Image and thats all it is..cycles within cycles..took me this long to figure out thats what trading is

Attached Image (click to enlarge) even though its nearly christmas, and liquidity will be low with little movement, eur/usd is looking like its setting up for a bullish reversal soon.

That is almost a carbon copy of what I am doing. I am using the Stochastic on the USD/JPY, but it really is not needed as investing101 has said. Thank you for your response. ________________________

Yes but the EURUSD Rsi stochastic is bullish "(Never trade against the direction of an oscillator in a monthly chart, this is your trend.."

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi cuchuflito; I don't care what any Indicator is saying I see the Monthly is in a Bearish Trend.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi investing101, Would you please upload one successfull trade by a picture of the chart? I still dont understand. Please explain again step by step with a chart picture. Thanks and Regards, anton

Hi All, can refer to spudfyre thread in http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=36574 . he also talk bout the stochastic mtf trading method. i think the explanation are great over there. this was an old thread. enjoy!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Is isn't hard to understand, if your big time frames are bullish (weekly, monthly) look for bearish situations in your small time frames (oversold oscillator).

--- 帖子 #199 ---
On my charts I also have a sine wave support and resistance indicator that helps find support and resistance, it isn't necessary.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Thank you for your input here

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi investing101; I like the idea behind what you are doing here. But if there's one thing that really annoys me it's when people start to make predictions about Market movement and then think, naively, they have the power to predict the Market. The Markets don't give a s@$t about us and what we think. The USD was Bullish across the board on Wednesday 17th caused by the news events highlighted in the image below. If the news release had gone the other way your prediction of a EUR drop, back, below 1.24 would have been totally wrong. I was more interested in last weeks Bullish Engulfing close because that has happened, fact, and it's there for all to see. I was waiting for Momentum to Break above, and then test, 1.25 RN before looking for Bullish PA to go long, which never happened. The reason for this plan of action was based on what the Market was telling me and not what I thought it should do. This is just a personal thing of mine I hope you don't take it too personally.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
lol i've got to laugh at this because this is so simple but it makes so much sense. thanks for sharing this i'm printing this and putting it next to my trading screens. i've got my own trading methods that seem to work but i can also use this as a extra precaution. Thanks for posting

--- 帖子 #203 ---
[quote=investing101;7941810]"... So if your monthly is bullish look for discrepancies in your lower time frames. If your daily if bullish look for discrepancies within your smaller time frames. Discrepancies within the small time frames equals quick opportunities while discrepancies within larger time frames like the 4 hour and above equal big moves in the direction of the larger time frames (daily, weekly, or monthly). This is how I determine the direction prices will take....." Invest 101, thank you very much for sharing. Could you be more specific please? Let's say my daily is bullish and there are discrepancies between daily and 4HR TFs. So, what are my opportunities? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
... Ignored Scardi You didn't ask me but I'll answer it, 101 is saying if the Daily Stoch has recently come out of Over Sold for example and is going up then you might think that we are Bullish, so you could drop down to a lower time frame, like say H4 and as the Daily Stoch continues to rise you are waiting for the 4 Hour to become over sold and look for long trades

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Candlestick, thank you for the reply, I thought like you. However in his first post Invest 101 says “ If your daily if bullish look for discrepancies within your smaller time frames. Discrepancies within the small time frames equals quick opportunities …..” and I wonder what are these “quick opportunities”.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi scardi; If the D1 Stochastic is Bullish drop down to the M15 Chart and wait for it to go "Oversold", it's going to go "Oversold" on M15 quicker than the H4 TF, this equals a quicker opportunity to get into a Trade. Might be wrong but that would be my understanding of it.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Its simple and works all the time.. I see it in my head like this: the daily is like a giant powerfull tsunami wave. the other lower timeframes are little waves that can try and go against it for short periods of time but eventually they get sucked in and have to go with the flow. I think its important to create images in our mind of how things work sometimes, it helps understand MUCH easier. I have a small issue regarding the daily though, alot of times it will reach overbought/sold but it will continue and not reverse. when should we wait to get in on the new direction? or is this the time we look at the weekly and monthly? thanks guys.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Stevepatt, thank you very much! I think you are right. Thank you buddy!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Weekly and monthly charts are my trend. Quick opportunities for me means holding for a few minutes to a few hours. If I found discrepancies in the 4hr charts and above that would equal a swing trade for me which could last a few days.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
A few days ago I warned traders to be careful about going long on Eur as the short trend on the daily chart was still intact. As we can see over the past few days price moved down sharply. Looking at the daily chart we see a new low and the MACD looking divergent. Price may start to stall to the downside and correct within the next week. Again keep in mind we have Xmas this week so prices may not move in a typical fashion due to lower liquidity.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
That's a great post on how to use stochastic with supply and demand zones to gauge price momentum at a level, interesting

So from 12/16/2014 onwards I am in sell positions. n all of a sudden it turned on me! Us, Aud, Nzd gbp all !! When do you think they would turn down again?

Hey when you said that you don't have time to have precise entries, do you mean that you take trades you know will go deeply negative... just having the understanding that because you've not over leveraged you'll just wait until the major trend resumes? In other words... no real stops? Or am I missing something.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi behman Not sure what experience you have with the principles of identifying institutional Supply &amp; Demand, but price on USDJPY looked like it first dropped off Daily Supply dating back to around 2007 (which is what was responsible for your Weekly engulfing bar) and then around your short entry at 115.74 it hit Daily/ H4 Demand and reversed Long again. So as a constructive comment, check out more on how to identify Supply and Demand zones, accept/assume that 50% will probably fail and therefore use a Stop Loss for when you are wrong. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi behman; I see from your profile you have subscribed to 20+ threads in the last three months. Why are you Trading live when you obviously don't have an idea of how you want to trade? Are you a Scalper or Swing Trader or Position Trader? Until you know the answer to this question you should NOT be Trading Live. Once you know, how you want to Trade, you can Target threads and information that relates to how you want to Trade and dismiss what isn't. By doing this you will learn what you need to, in relation to your chosen style, and once you become confident with what you are doing move on to Trading live.

hI ALL, Has anyone figured out a way to fit this supply and demand method onto one chart? like having three different stochs or RSI'S but instead of flipping through the charts, one could stay one the and have three corresponding indicators? ps i know its a bit confusing but any help would help thanks

--- 帖子 #231 ---
This post is not meant to rub salt into your wounds. But why would you want to short ALL jpy pairs? Aud and Cad I can understand to some small extent (Aud due to commodity and China weakness and Cad due to oil). but regardless Jpy has been weak for some time, the charts and long term data should tell you this at a glimpse, the small rally (and it was small in the context of long term) was mainly on elections and should have been seen as buying opportunities not selling. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Take Stevepatt's advice and stop searching. Find a trading strategy that makes sense to you and stick with it . So even when trades go wrong, and they will, you can console yourself by knowing why you entered. if you don't you will only end up quitting or WORSE, jumping from system to system getting know where. Good luck

Steve i love your clean chart set-up. can I ask what these indicators are? and are they all on Nilhilist thread? some look similar to what i use ADR and TP EA but a lot more discreet and cleaner. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hello all, I was interested to see this novel use of oscillators! I like the idea but confess to still being slightly confused... Please see the attached chart of the Dax, showing Daily, Hourly and 15 min. Clearly the Daily is "overbought" and just looking like it might tip down. The Hourly is also "overbought" but the stoch is already moving down. The 15 min has hammered down to "oversold" but without the price following it. If the higher TF's were still moving up I would read the O/S level on the M15 as a buy signal. But they aren't. Please would one of the experts be as kind as to give me an analysis of the situation here.... Many thanks indeed. If you celebrate Christmas, a Very Happy Christmas and a Prosperous New Year to you. If you don't I hope you have a peaceful holiday and a pip-filled year ahead! Kind regards, Old Dog .

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hello Old Dog, I'm not expert but I'd like to describe it for my own benefit. Looking at the daily chart, I guess this is an uptrend in weekly/monthly charts. So, since both of the two higher TFs H1 &amp; D1 are currently in downward direction, chances are they both reach the oversold area before resuming the uptrend, until when I think we should wait for an entry as per a suitable opportunity in M15. Thanks

Hi abofar In your analysis you would use a "top down" approach, not unlike the principles of this thread using the stochastic Thanks

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi Yao I have questions may need your help 1. What did you mean by "top down view"? Can you elaborate further? 2. Second question is that I have EJ chart attached and I see MN Stoch is UP, but W1 Stoch is heading DOWN from OB, D1 Stoch is DOWN and I am trading only DAY chart (DAILY Stoch is DOWN), shall I follow reference of W1 chart and enter SELL straight away? This way I ignored the MN trend... Sorry for confusion. Thanks in advanced for reply!!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
NSN; Look the direction of W1 when trading D1 is correct and that is the top-down view, but the second part 101 probably will not take. It's the reason he does not have sl due to very low risk. It's your choice, here is the 101 method. Good luck

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Thanks Yao for very well and self explained diagram!Did I get your meaning right? What did you mean by 101 probably will not take is because the MN trend is against the W1? am I right?And last question, in your entry chart is it necessary to wait stoch to go over level 80 or 20? Because from my observation sometime in a strong trend stoch will only hits level 50 and bounced from that level.... How do you determine that level to enter? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
nsn: 101 is investing101. read his previous posts that he will take trade in the same direction as mn. but if you are confidence to trade on the reverse direction, please place proper sl to protect ur asset if something went the other way. if u see his post, i believed that he did not wait the supply/demand level to go over 80/20. see the post #47 101, please correct me if i am wrong. thx

How to analyze a chart when the oscillator moves up slowly when price is moving up faster

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Yes I did. I am a trader forex since 2006. I tested many indicators and most of them are lazy and/or useless. Price action, MultiTimeFrame analysis, Supply/Demand, Support/Resistance, Pivot, Psychological numbers, Trendline, Moving average (dynamic trendline), money management and learning are our Holy Grail to make money.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thank you Yao! Is there any trade with this method recently? If any please post chart, I would like to learn more..

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I would like to know the answer too...can you post the chart?..

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Then probably the oscillator is going in the direction of the trend or news came out.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Seems right.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
101, thank u very much. I have PMs you several times and this method does give good results even I'm still practicing with smaller lot. I hope one day when I got full confidence I will play large lot like u. u are my best teacher. How do u see the future of eurusd because 1.18 is entered? thx

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Right there! This guy's got the most logical method of trading. Now I feel hopeful &amp; confident about my future trading career.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi 101, Yao May I post GA chart for study purposes? For instance, let say I am trading with D1 chart, and I have to check longer TF, it is MN. MN Stoch is up, indicating Price still up (BUYING POWER) D1 Stoch goes down faster than Price do, indicate less selling... So, we will BUY once see Stoch cross upside. Am I correct in above analysis? I am not include W1 in above analysis. If I include W1 chart, then W1 Stoch is down...the decision of BUYING in D1 chart maybe postpone until we see W1 stoch heading up... Please correct me, I am learning...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
nsn, mn up w1 down, u should buy when d1 past the os again if u want to take risk or skip this. thx

--- 帖子 #261 ---
u will be better than me, congs. when ur asset double, let us know. Thx

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Please help me to understand your statement: You mean ignore the W1 BUY immediately when D1 raise from OS area which follow MN's trend? Thanks in advanced.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Wait for the weekly oscillator to settle near oversold territory, when it does we will probably see a lot of churning before it goes up.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
nsn; personally i do not trade this condition due to some degree of risk, but if u want to take chance and really like this pair u can trade it by placing some sl. but i recommend skip it and look for some other better pairs. thx yao

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi 101 I dont really/fully understand your method I try to read your post over and over again but I found that you are not simply use Stoch OB/OS or its' direction in your strategy. You try to use stoch as determine Demand n Supply. That's why you say we can use other oscillators as well. Am I get your point?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
If a large time frame's oscillator is bullish wait for a bearish oscillator in a smaller time frame so you could go long. Pay attention to price action, if you could interpret price action you will know when demand or supply is present.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi 101 You say "larger TF's oscillator is bullish", is it the same with Oscillator (in this case we refer to stoch as example) is heading up? Because as per your teaching, sometime Stoch mayb up but PA not as 'bullish' as Oscillator...we know that there is no Demand (hope I am using the correct word)...the trend is consider bear. So, in the case like this shall we still wait for bearish oscillator in smaller tf to go "long"? Hope you understand my point..

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Is it harder to see the price action on higher time frames, like H4, D1, W1?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Say for example , take 30 minute chart as smaller TF, and Daily chart as Larger TF, I attached EU Daily chart which show Stoch going up leaving OS area.. In smaller TF, for 30 minutes, Stoch is heading down.... Question: If we traade using 30m chart, we will refer to Daily...and we will wait for Stoch to head up as we should not trade against Longer TF (Which is Daily in this example...)?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I think the problem most people have is the price action part. for example..most of the time if you follow your stochs accordingly with the correct timeframes you will get 8/10 correct trades..but if ur not carefull the other 2/10 can go the other way for longer than you expect and lose your profits..so to make sure if the price action is going upwards dont sell straight away..let it slow down and range..when it starts to range it means its changing trend to the one you need. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Just because you are looking at a daily chart doesn't mean that is the trend! Trend is down so wait for the daily to become overbought. Now you are giving me two different time frames, the 30 minute and the daily. Statistically we cannot compare the two because the are so different. If you were to trade the 30 minute pick something like the 120 min chart to reference your entry. I would pick two or three time frames from the following options: 15 min, 60 min, 240 min, daily, weekly, or monthly. (never pick time frames that differ greatly from one another like you did, it is a lot harder to interpret any prices action and correlation for that matter). Notice these time frames divide almost equally into one another that is statistically important in my opinion if you have a multi chart strategy.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
M30 4 time larger TF(m30*4=2H) is H4. Since daily tf is already at OS, use H4 as ur trend direction, trade EU down per ur M30. thxEDIT: eu looks like in a turning point, even it is in the ob area, trade with care. it can go up or down.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
This strategy is very simple in theory but not easy to execute in the market. Please post some charts for analysis. The way I understood is that look at 3 time frames. The biggest TF is the direction you will trade. The middle TF must be either OB or OS and the smallest TF cross of the indicator is the trigger. And extra safety net is that the month TF is the real trend. I still took so many wrong entries. Please advise me on where I am going wrong

--- 帖子 #284 ---
basically ur correct, just need more practise. in ur case 2nd tf has to be the same direction as the trend of 1st one and 2nd has to pass ob/os, then when smallest 3rd reached ob/os, place ur order. thx, 101

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Thanks guys. That's what I thought.......... I have been using aliens system for some time and it seems to work perfectly for this system

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I found one thing that personally irritates me over the years, people filling their charts with so many lines and indicators. Believe me I have done that before and it is all garbage. Keep it simply! all you need is price action and momentum in your side to be successful. Why have 10 indicators on your chart when all ten of your indicators are based on an identical statistical model (price). If you personally have to have multiple indicators on your charts choose indicators that are not correlated: volume, price, and level 2.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Marck, can you post some charts? thx

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I believe you are 100% correct all those indicators to me are useless. Why would you need an indicator when the data is telling you the story. All you need is a Trend Line, Support / Resistance , Fibonacci's and the daily trading range on a 60 Min chart, if you are day trading. The larger the time frame the easier it is to see direction.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I posted some on previous posts.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Will this indicator work on MT4? It does go in the TPL folder..

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Of course, this is mine. thx

--- 帖子 #298 ---
im flattered by the simplicity and how much sense this system makes. im using the multiple stoch's indicator posted a couple of posts ago. i've attached my templates as I combined them in one window. PS: I tried to use the FFx RSI indicator but im unable to get it to run as I cant access the market place. That could be also very useful too. If anyone could help out on getting that indicator... highly appreciated. ksh

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hey guys, I think ive finally seen the light with this method over this weekend whilst studying over the thread again, all i can say is that the overbought areas are not the main focus like everyone is making out, its all about when the higher timeframe oscillator leaves the overbought/sold area and the timeframe oscillator below that one goes against it briefly like a pull-back and back in direction with the higher TF, this is when you should get into the trade.

The key is seeing how price reacts to an oscillator that is going against the major trend.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Master 101; Please help us to understand more by a graph, I believed this is an art and from ur many past experiences. thx

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hello Yao, by looking at the magnitute of the move, when you see shorter move, that's retracement. Another element is the time, it takes longer time and choppy movement when you see retracement. at the top of the retracement, that's when you go in. another way to do this is using MACD as directional indicator, and stochastic as entry. hope it helps. LP

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I agree..a screenshot is very much needed for easier and faster understanding. could you provide with one too please? thx

--- 帖子 #307 ---
{quote} could you provide with one too please? thx[/quote] I am at work, I will post a chart to share with you when i get back to my computer. cheeres LP

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Read post #303 by 101investing...he advises us to follow main trend, and see how 'price' response to the oscillator!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I agree with Yao and others, a chart will speak clearer....please post chart.....

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Guys it is about watching price action as price goes against the major trend. To do that you have to see things live not as a picture.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Please see chart. I dont mean to intrude 101's thread, I hope it helps other traders. MACD is directional indicator, so it shows the big trend. in the mean time, stoch is cyclical indicator, it shows cycles within the trend. By looking at the magnitude of the cycle we can indentify trend direction. Same Idea with the stoch. I post the pic just hope to help you understand. i'm at work, so i just post the online chart. sorry... LP Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Thanks LP Attached Image So from my understanding The price is reacting normally to the MACD and then there is a pullback upwards and price looks like it slows down, this is the time that the stochastic also goes into overbought and this would be our trade is this correct? thx

--- 帖子 #313 ---
BIngo, but becareful on one thing, the pic i showed is after the fact, in real time, its really hard to see, because the MACD could be sticking together (the lines), so its hard to tell if it will cross up and trend change to upside. But with the help of "going with the main trend", in this case, its down, you can pretty much nail it. plus if there is any major news come out during that time, it would act like catalyst and price dropped even faster. hope it helps. LP

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thank you for sharing your method Investing101 - using the oscillator to gauge supply and demand is brilliant. Attached is an example of my interpretation. Following this method would have prevented you from being long on gbpchf when the **** hit the fan last week. The top gray bar is supply. The stochastic: purple-MN, red-W1, green-D1. The 1st arrow in the sub-window is when the MN started turning down from OB - back in December. Recall that Investing 101 stated not to go against the monthly osc. unless it was OB/OS and prices were consolidating. The 2nd arrow shows D1 &amp; W1 stoch in OB, after a relatively weak move into supply. Went short after the outside bar, then added 2 more positions as the D1 osc. moved up strongly while price, not so much. 1st target was 200 pips, 2nd &amp; 3rd were swept down with the tsunami.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Thank you, low profile; I can see there is a tight relationship between MACD and stochs, will study more. True, its a very great tool to see the move, many many thanks to ur contribution. regards, Yao

One thing I forgot to mention about my experience: People get into the forex game because they see a method to getting quick and leveraged profits. This alone automatically changes the mentality of a person, people start to overtrade. In actuality success using leveraged instruments is dependent on patience. Profit factor is now over 900.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi all, Put it this way, we many diff types of traders participating in the forex market. intraday, swing, position, and long term investors. what you are trying to achieve here is to enter a trade when all those types of trader are agreed in same direction, ie. indicator showing on different timeframe represent diff types of traders. Once you get the concept/mindset, it will be much easier for you. if you can trade full time, you can trade off the 4H, if you have a full time job, weekly would be the way to go. hope it makes sense.

------------------ Dear mates !Dear investing101! may give your opinion about this pair {image}[/quote] Looks like you are short...pair is hitting the upper resistance trend line, BUT, short on an OB hour chart, while dayly and 4 hour Stoch are bullish...! Having said that, those indies that plot many time frames stochs, in one window are fine... PROVIDED:you find the right indicator setting for every time frame before... same setting doesn´t work for every time frame and /or pair... Plot the indi and double check if it correlates well with the swings...then adjust the parameteres accordingly...it´s easy.. Don´t need to do this every day....but correlation to the indi changes from time to time... same goes for MACD or DTOSC.... My 2 cents... Happy next week trading...

I only trade the EURUSD for certain reasons. Other currencies are too dependent on various variables "news" that could affect direction.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Well if they do leave, probably eur will bounce back...remember, "sell on the rumour, buy on the news"...won´t happen tomorrow though...

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Dear mates ! Dear investing101! Please tell your opinion about this pair! Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #367 ---
See what I mean, the picture says sell but trading the CAD involves paying attention to crude oil. Oil dropped GBP continued up.

Don't know if that applies here. Greece leaving will create much greater pressure downward as Italy and Spain start asking questions. The way i'm seeing it, price action is giving us hints that there is more potential for downside than upside. This is where Oscillators can really murder you if you are a slave to them. IMO Keep your stops tights if your trading EUR pairs. Notice how this trade wouldn't have come near the original TP and you would either be stopped out, or now facing large losses. If this trade was profitable, you had to be on your toes to close the trade because it reversed a few hours later. The oscillators are there to aid you in trading, that's the point of this thread. Investing101 says in the 2nd paragraph, "after sleepless nights and days of watching price action. " This is key, the PA in this chart wouldn't have told you to go short because it's basically an extended bull flag formation with lower highs meaning that there is pressure building to the upside, which is exactly what ended up happening after a short bear trap. I took the opposite trade and shorted the EURGBP and ended up with this. Notice the bear flag formation with a nice textbook pinbar reversal a few hours back. All of these are clues pointing to the future price movement. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So my earlier texbook observation on oscillator Weekly and Monthly trend is up and that we need to wait for H4 and H1 OS to buy is a fair assumption right ?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
When you said the picture tell "sell" you mean weekly oscillator .. and H1 oscillator .. is OB or what ?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
You're right. In this case it would have worked well!

More clear rules for this thread must be made, otherwise is confusing to new folks who want to learn. You are saying not to trade against MN stochastic direction, cause this is the "trend". Stochastic does not show trend direction, it just shows movement of price in the near past. In the example on page2 you give a simple template how to trade this system, but highest TF you follow is Daily, not Weekly or MN...

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Does anyone know of an indicator that clearly displays a comparison between price movement and stochastic oscillator movement?

I have found that USD pairs seem to be the best when spotting the differences between price movement and stochastic oscillator movement. Can anyone confirm this? I know the OP traded EURUSD (solely, I believe).

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Thank you Investing101 for this incredible strategy. I know you said that you only trade it on EUR/USD. but I have backtested it on the majors and some of the crosses and it works damn well; I am not sure if this is because I trade higher time frames. I have been live trading it as well and have only had one loss in over a dozen trades and that loss was only due to me not reading price action well and entering early causing price to hit my stop loss. I trade the 4 hour charts and most of the time i find i can get 1.5:1 reward risk if not 2:1. of course trading on the 4 hour charts has fewer trades but i have also been experimenting with 1 hour charts on the majors and my strike rate remains the same, however there are significantly more trades and the reward risk ratio is greater than 2:1 most of the time. AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY. IF THERE EVER WAS A HOLY GRAIL I BELIEVE THIS IT. I will continue to learn and do my best to master this strategy and read price action as well as you can

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I find that having pre-drawn S&amp;R lines and waiting for price to get there filter getting in too early. 2nd thing I wait for is for stochatic to cross down as extra confirmation or a significant candlestick pattern (pinbar, engulfing bar etc)

--- 帖子 #389 ---
hey FXyao I use trading view as my charting platform. they have a risk reward tool on there. you can just place it on your charts. the only thing i do is extended my stop loss to fit my criteria. 2nd you can you use price action to pick your sl or tp. i just posted on the supply/demand forum a short trade i recently took. if you look at it, you can see price had made some previous lows and this could be your take profit. I find pre-drawing support and resistance line and waiting for price to get there results in better trades as well as lower stop loss... as far as time,......i trade 4hour charts so i just check my charts every 4 hours lol........I just take the trades when they show up.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
trade I took a while ago. Lined up with my pre-drawn 7900 level resistance, 2 bar reversal candlestick pattern as even more confirmation. took profit at 7600 level. B y the way i trade 4hour charts so i use weekly daily and 4 hour as my time frames. happy trading all

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi All Can any one here help me in gauging the difference between the stoch movements and price movements. I always see the oscillator movements different from price movement but I interpret that to delay of the oscillator (lagging). Does the oscillator really lag the price ? .If that so how can you see the price moving in pace with oscillator or not ? .Can we have some charts to show that?. Is it really important to have different oscillator settings for different time frame? . The problem with this nice thread is that some traders express their understanding of investing101 method and they understand it differently. There is so much confusion. Some traders say follow the trend of the oscillator and investing101 says look for discrepancy. Do we trade discrepancy or follow the oscillator in different time frames? What is discrepancy is it diversions or something else?. If the is oscillator going up and price is going opposite direction ,which one we follow.? Thanks for Investing 101 for sharing his trading method and for all of you for your participating.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I interpreted investing101's method to be to use an HTF oscillator to show trend direction, THEN look for a pull back on the current TF oscillator, THEN look for discrepancies between the current TF oscillator and price movement. Some on here are just using the HTF oscillator to show trend direction, then trade the pull back of the current TF oscillator. After days of looking at charts I am starting to see the entries as investing101 has described, but I have not been able to trade with the accuracy that others have claimed.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I think you are very much correct.That is exactly what I understood .Thank you very much for your clarification. Here is a link similar in someway to Investing101 method: http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/educati...cillators.html

--- 帖子 #394 ---
hey guys, i want to leave you a great indicator here today which im sure will help you, this version of the stochastic on chart moves with the price movement unlike the earlier version..so you will be able to see if the price is behaving accordingly to the oscillator or if you should wait. enjoy.

This sounds like a great strategy. One question, when you say the stochastic is on an uptrend, does that mean it's in the center moving up or its in the oversold zone looking to move up?

Thank you. So the answer is center going up? Thanks 4hourtrader

So over night major banks got wrong footed on their Euro trades. I got tons of emails of banks being stopped out of their positions. Yes most time frames were overbought but when you have a monthly chart whose oscillator is starting to look bullish you have a ticking bullish time bomb. All we need is a major catalyst to see the Euro soar based on the bullishness of the monthly chart. What will it be? Greece bailout deal I am certain. I predict that Greece will sign a deal in the next few days seeing how at the end of June the bailout extension expires. My last prediction was that the Euro would see a turnaround in conjunction with crude oil, it happened.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Welcome back, 101 master! Do you suggest that we should start trading euro up from now on? Thx

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Did you see COT report on EUR?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I think that we might be heading down on the Euro, at least until later this month as we get close to a Greek bailout. The anticipation might keep us in a range but I would be careful because any day now Greece is highly likely to announce a deal. When we do get the bailout we might trend up for a while. The bailout is for around $10 billion dollars so it is only a matter of weeks before they spend that money. It is likely they will need another bailout in the coming months and it is then that we might head towards euro dollar parity if nothing is done.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Dear Masrer 101; Thank you so much for the explanation will wait to see the possible change at the end of June, also please update us when you think the turnaround actually happens. Thx

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I really like the concepts in this thread however, I am not sure how I feel about investing101's risk reward ratio. If you look at one of his analysis files you can see that his avg trade profit was $1100 and the average draw down was $5200. Is this ratio acceptable, given the win %? Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I leave trades open without managing them. I just started using a risk/reward strategy that allows be to automatically manage the trade after placing a trade. I don't like being attached to a monitor all day so I closed any profit I saw without thinking about the risk/reward ratio.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
There are two separate ideas behind supply and demand FX trading. One which is rooted in International Financial Economics ie Balance of Payments supply and demand, and the other in price action patterns on candle stick charts. Which method do you use?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Just as expected no deal=bloodbath for the Euro. Anyways I read what price is doing to time my trades and focus on big economic events that could potentially change the trend of the currency.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
hi investing, great method..id like to ask you a quick question. how do you avoid big drawdown when you get in a trade when the oscillators reach oversold/bought levels? thx

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I also want to ask this, if i want to make only 15 pips at a time, should i stick to the 4hr+1hr+15m OR d1+4hr+15 ? thnks

Hello Investing &amp; Everyone, Thanks for the taking the time to explain and Investing for your generosity. I have been re-reading the thread to understand and still being a novice and not experienced like some of the members, i am in confusion, i apologize in advance for asking any newbie concepts/questions. *********** My understanding is we are not supposed to take any signal that is against the monthly oscillator. In the above example, 3 Time frames are being used: 15 Minute-TF1 4 Hour-TF2 Daily-TF3 a. 15 Minute Time Frame as the Entry. b. 4 Hour Time frame is being referenced by 15 Minute Time Frame for discrepancy. My Questions: Q1. What is the significance of including the 3rd Time Frame i.e. daily time frame? Q2. Are we deriving the trend from the monthly oscillator or is the monthly oscillator direction is used to a filter out trades that are not in sync(i.e. we use a different time frame to get the trend like weekly,daily and monthly as a cross-check.) Q3. In the above example, when 15 minute time frame is in overbought, we are comparing it 4 Hour time frame which is going down. Does the daily also have to go down simultaneously with 4 hour for us to take the trade? *************** Investing &amp; Everyone, I know you are busy and i would be grateful if could take the time to answer my queries...

Fibonacci Retracements in Forex Trading http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...cy-trading.jpg Home &gt; FXIMPULSE Forex Course &gt; Forex Trading Sytem &gt; Technical Analysis &gt; Fibonacci Retracements &gt; powered by https://www.google.com/uds/css/small-logo.png Custom Search Web 8.1. What are Fibonacci Retracements? Fibonacci retracements are percentage values which can be used to predict the length of corrections in a trending market. Most popular retracement levels used for the forex trading are 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% . In a strong trend you can expect the currency prices to retrace a minimum of 38.2 percent; in a weaker trend corrections may go as far as 61.8 percent. The 50 % is the most widely monitored retracement level and is a common area to buy in the up trends or sell in the down trends. If a correction exceeds one of the retracement levels - look for it to go to the next (e.g. to 50% after the 38.2% level or to 61.8% after the 50% level). Whenever the prices retrace more than 61.8% of the previous move (on a closing basis) you can expect them to return all the way back to the beginning of the trend. Fibonacci retracements in an up trend http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...ts-uptrend.gif Fibonacci retracements in a down trend http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...-downtrend.gif Fibonacci Retracements in the Up Trend http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...-audusd-cr.gif http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...-audusd-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. Fibonacci Retracements in the Down Trend http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...-eurusd-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. Fibonacci retracements were derived from the similarly named mathematic sequence, discovered by the 12th century mathematician known as Fibonacci. This sequence has been found in numerous objects throughout nature - from the number of the flower petals to the way the spiral galaxies in the outer space are constructed. In this series each successive number is the sum of the two previous numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 and so on (e.g. 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, etc.). Any given number is roughly 1.618 times the preceding number (e.g. 144/89 = 1.618) and approximately 0.618 times the following number (e.g. 89/144 = 0.618). Consequently, 38.2% is the result of the division of 0.618 by 1.618 and 61.8% is the result of dividing 1.0 by 1.618. Forex market being the largest market in the world most closely comes to operating like a huge natural mechanism whose behaviour can be explained by the laws governing other natural phenomena. This is the reason why fibonacci levels work so well on the forex market. In the same fashion that the bigger numbers in the fibonacci sequence give closer ratios to 1.618 and 0.618 so the larger currency movements are more likely to be followed by more precise corrections of either 38.2%, 50% or 61.8%. Quote: "The emotional crowd acts according to nature. Fibs uncover the concealed interface between mathematics and emotion as they predict how the herd will respond to price development", Alan S. Farley in his book, " The Master Swing Trader: Tools and Techniques to Profit from Outstanding Short-Term Trading Opportunities ". Quote: "Thomas of Aquinas described one of the basic rules of aesthetics—man's senses enjoy objects that are properly proportioned. He referred to the direct relationship between beauty and mathematics, which is often measurable and can be found in nature. Man instinctively reacts positively to clear geometrical forms, in both his natural environment and in objects created by him, such as paintings. Thomas of Aquinas was referring to the same principle that Fibonacci discovered.", Robert Fischer, in his book, " Fibonacci Applications and Strategies for Traders ". 8.2. How to Draw Fibonacci Levels: To draw fibonacci retracement levels start by calculating the pip distance (e.g. 200 pips) between some recent high and low (as soon as a price swing has occurred). These points can be the highest and the lowest prices seen during complete price moves within the trend (e.g. minor rallies for an up trend or minor declines in a down trend, whose trendline has been broken) or during the whole time the trend has been developing. As a second step, find the percentage of this distance corresponding to each retracement level (e.g. 38.2% of 200 is 76 pips; 50% of 200 is 100 pips; 61.8% of 200 is 124 pips). Finally, subtract each of these pip numbers from the high point for an up move or add them to the low point in the case of a down move. The following examples illustrate these steps: Fibonacci retracements calculated for a strong down move visible on the daily USD/CAD chart http://www.forexhit.com/images/drawi...wntrend-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. Fibonacci retarcements calculated for a sharp rise, appearing on the 1-hour EUR/USD chart http://www.forexhit.com/images/drawi...uptrend-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. Note: All modern forex charting packages will draw retracement levels for you automatically - just pick a top and a bottom. Note : You can use our web-based Fibonacci Calculator (Please note: This calculator requires that Javascript is enabled in your browser)- to quickly calculate exact retracement levels for the moves that you observe in your forex trading. 8.3. Using Fibonacci Retracements in Forex Trading You can use fibonacci retracements to add to your existing position or to initiate new trades - in accordance with the underlying trend. Whenever the currency prices get overbought or oversold you can expect a correction to develop, which should have a high probability of stopping at one of the fibonacci retracement levels - thereby providing you with a low risk/high reward trading opportunity . The 38.2% and the 61,8% retracements visible on the daily EUR/CHF proved to be excellent levels to buy the pair. http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...uptrend-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. 50 percent retracement presented lucrative sell entry level during the EUR/NZD downtrend, visible on the hourly charts. http://www.forexhit.com/images/fibon...wntrend-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. There will sometimes be more than one retracement level close to the price action. Some of these levels will belong to the longer-term price movements, visible on the charts of higher time-frame (e.g. daily or weekly charts). It pays to keep track of these "larger" levels - as formidable support or resistance areas - and take them into account when planning your trades . As a general rule, when there is the convergence of fibonacci retracement levels from different-length moves the strength of this level or area will increase . The larger the moves from which the retracement levels originate and the more of them coincide - the more important this area becomes. http://www.forexhit.com/images/overl...wntrend-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. http://www.forexhit.com/images/overl...uptrend-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. Note: You can specify how long back to look for the retracemet levels in your daily checklist. Note: Most banks' technical analysis reports and real-time forex news feeds (like Marketnews) provide extensive, multi-time-frame fibonacci analysis. If the other technical analysis tools confirm the existence of support or resistance at some fibonacci retracement level - this increases the chances that the currency prices will reverse at this level. The more technical studies line up with a retracement level (for example, a reversal candlestick pattern accompanied by Stochastics turning back from an extreme reading) the more likely it is that the correction will be completed by it. For more information on using different tools to confirm validity of support or resistance please visit the support and resistance page. The following examples illustrate this principle. http://www.forexhit.com/images/multi...acement-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. http://www.forexhit.com/images/multi...cement2-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. 8.4. Mastering Fibonacci Retracements. As a foreign exchange trader you should try to become proficient at drawing and using fibonacci retracements - because they are so widely watched among the forex trading community. All of books on currency trading will provide you with detailed guidance on how to effectively use fibonacci retracements in your trading. As with the trendlines the only way to master fibonacci retracements is to continually practice drawing them.

I have been gone for a while I think it is time for an update on what is going on with the EURO Dollar. I think Morgan Stanley is onto something with their recent article on the Dollar. FED policy has weakened while Europe's policy remains the same and they seem committed to continuing. If the FED stays with their policy unchanged I definitely see a big up move on the Euro. If you look at your charts we have been in a horizontal channel since the 1st quarter on 2015 with no clear sense of what direction we are heading to. Morgan Stanley's opinion combined with oversold indicators in very large time frames "aka weekly, monthly" are indicating a very strong move up is coming for the Euro.

Hello Investing Sir, Thanks for giving your inputs.My apologizes in advance as i am still a noob and kindly help me in clearing my confusion. I am quoting two of your posts: ****************************** Post 1: "You could avoid trading news or trade based on higher time frames. I can't remember the last time I followed news reports, frankly I am too busy to care about news so I trade based higher time frames. The results are based on not caring what news or analysts say and focusing on demand and supply. Yeah some news made my account volatile sometimes but it is only temporary. My advice would be to either avoid news or have enough buying power so the trade comes back to you." ******************************* Post 2: "I take fundamentals very seriously, in fact I don't trade news but sometimes I am in a trade for hours or days and obviously experience news. It just helps being in the side of the trend." ************************************ 1. As long as we trade in higher time frames, can we ignore the fundamentals even though the account might be volatile temporarily? 2. When you say, you take fundamentals seriously, do you mean you analyze the market along the lines like: "FED is doing XYZ, NFP results could be something or the probability ABC event happening is high". So the trade according to fundamentals is going long. You now then look for an opportunity to long as per the system? (or) Do you trade originally as per system with the exception that if any event is close by you stay on the sidelines? I am making the assumption that Fundamentals is translated into news... Investing Sir, your guidance is much appreciated... Thanks
