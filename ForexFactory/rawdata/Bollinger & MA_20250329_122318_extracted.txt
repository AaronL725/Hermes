The Bollinger &amp; MA trading system. (BMA) This thread is influenced by the BK8 system. Link . But it is different and also the way I handle the thread is different. The OP BK8 wished that the thread was fully about his system. Many OP's does it that way. I fully respect that, because I have seen so many threads been "hijacked" by people talking totally different systems. But if you request a very strict line, then there are good ideas that are missed. Therefore - in this thread we discus the BMA system which I present below. But it is very welcome to try all timeframes, using it in a different way and bring in confluencing indicators. The purpose is, to make a system giving a nice profit. Just remember what the basis is. Of cause if anybody tries to Hijack the thread - you are kicked out. Same if people cannot behave. And I mean it and will do. When the thread was started, we used SMA5. But it gives a lot of signals which are no good. Therefore the strategy now uses only EMA50. The thing about EMA50 is, that it is the trend (other values can be used). So using this strategy you find the BOUNCES from the trend and this is really what matters and what this strategy is about. In this system there are 3 indicators who are all mandatory. Bollinger. EMA50 - The trendline. Stochastic Variable at 14.3.3. Timeframe (TF) I normally use daily. The most stabile. But if someone want to try it on different timeframes - you are very welcome. Let us hear about your results. But - I have recently started a PROP account and want 1 trade every day. That is not likely at the daily, so I use M30 for that. It is going well. Instruments I use the 28 normal FOREX pairs. PLEASE note that this is FOREX Factory and that is what we are trading. You can of cause trade whatever you like, but we only refer to FOREX in this thread. Strategy - BUY trades. Short trades are opposite. Price reached the low Bollinger border and is now going up. Last bar closed above EMA50. If the the bar is a little short, then wait for then next bar to give confirmation. Stoploss (SL) at the Bollinger band or the last swing low. When is it not working. EMA50 Must be crossed within 3 - 5 bars after crossing over the Bollinger side band. Otherwise find another trade. In ranging environments (unless you are very experienced). A nice strong trend is necessary. Exit is not part of this strategy. Let us hear how you does that. My charts have black background because I am working a lot during night times. The Robot BolloingerMA_5 Watch post#84 for the latest version. The robot does not trade for you, but it gives you the signals. OP has reserved the first 9 post's for further explanations and examples. Update: This was not a good idea. Strategy change of cause as we work with it, that is the point of this thread. But now I am not allowed to edit these post from 2 to 9 - neither am I allowed to deleted any posts. So please be adviced, that even if I still think that the texts are relevant then some of it is no longer part of this strategy. Sorry for the confusion.

Indicators setup

Robot The work is ongoing. In a couple of days it is here. It will not be able to trade for you. It wil give you the signals on a silver plate, but you have to trade manually. But there will be some automated stoploss functionality. More about that later. The robot will be free. Never for sale. But I will code a stop to ensure that nobody can grab it and sell it. The stop will be prolonged once a year.

Trending trades How do I see that this chart is trending? There are the difficult answers - and the easy one. EMA50 is going up 35 degree or more. Yes, it is cherry picked in order to show the system, but hey - this is the kind of picture you want to trade if you are a trend follower. So there were 5 trades since March. Number #3 was not super perfect, but it had profit. When the robot comes, it would have generated exactly those 5 signals. I have only showed the BUY trades. But look at it, there are some very fine SELL trades, even if the trend is upwards. But be sure to have risk management in place and be sure to set SL at break even as soon as possible.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Swing trades All trends start somewhere. And you don't get the start unless you are ready to trade against the trend. In this example the price is swinging a lot. A trend seems not to be able to continue. So in this case you have to trade against the current trend . or not trade. Again cherry picked example. But ain't those loads of winning pips wonderfull?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Ranging trades Most pairs are trending on the daily timeframe, so I had to go down on 1H to find a good ranging example. As you can see, trades are possible, but they are not as stable as trading the trending pairs. And you must be on your toes the nurse the trades.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Exits There are no recommended type of exit in the BMA. Let me hear from all of you traders what you are using. Possibilities: · Bollinger Exit. If you Buy Long, then exit when the price reach the upper Bollinger band. A quit safe way with lots of positive trades. But also smaller profits than you can get at other methods. At the end of the day this might be one of the best exit methods. · Parabolic SAR exit. This indicator is NO GOOD at ranging symbols. But in a trend I think it is a nice tool to find the end of the trend. · Fibonacci - between 50 and 61.8. · Risk / Reward. Like risk 1 ATR and take profit at 2 ATR. · Support / Resistance. · TP at End of Day. · TP at cross back on SMA5. and many more. Many traders like to trade the Entry on a smaller TF, when signal are given at Daily - and then follow the trade at the Daily. That gives a much better Risk/Reward. I never had succes doing that. But I would like to follow any who are using that method. In smaller timeframes I like to take x% profit according to the account balance at the start of the day. When x% is reached, I close all trades and call it a day. On this thread I will trade Daily. (Maybe smaller TF during the day to keep me awake ;-). So I take 2 trades at 1% risk each. I use Risk:Reward 1:1 at the first trade. When profit is reached on the first trade, I set BE (Break Even) at #2 and let it run - trailing it with the Parabolic SAR. But note, that this strategy is often taking the trades faster than the SAR can follow it, and at the beginning of the trade, the SAR might show opposite direction!

Risk Management It is utmost important that you use Risk Management. Allways risk a small percent of your account. In this thread I take 2 trades of each signal, risking 1% on each. So how many Lots can I buy then?? Step 1 - find a signal you want to trade. Step 2 - find the stoploss. It would be either a bollinger band or the last swing high. Step 3 - Count the pips from the current price to the chosen stoploss. Step 4 - Go to Position Size Calculator | Myfxbook . Fill in the formula (Easy). Now you get the trade size in Lots. Do this every time you trade. If you then put in the chosen stoploss when you trade, then you will never loose more than the percentage of the account that you choosed. NOTE! I normally calculate the lot in a spread sheet. So I have not tried this tool myself. Will do in the coming week. ********************************************************************************************************************************** NEW!!! I found a LOT calculator. It seems to work. Let's check it. NOTE. When you enter the stoploss, then it is in POINTS. 1 Pip = 10 Points. So if you want a 50 Pips stoploss, you must enter 500!! If you forget it, then you are going to buy 10 times as much as you wanted! Be very carefull. In the screen STOP is the number of points in the stoploss and RISK is the percentage of the account balance that you wish to risk. Note that the indicator window of the LOT calculator can be clicked small using the "_".

My trades I will put 1000$ into an account (real money) and trade the Daily with this system. I will show each and every trade on a spread sheet here. Starting monday 17. October. There will not be trades every day at the Daily. Therefore I will trade smaller TF for the fun on a Demo account. They will not be counted on the spread sheet, but I will show some selected trades from time to time. This is the spread sheet I will use. Let me improve it for some days, then I will upload it for others to use it.

Interesting. Waiting for future updates.. God willing going to be profitable for all of us!. God bless.

I've always liked the BK thread, and be giving it a try next week. I think adding the 50EMA is a great idea. I'm looking forward of trying this next week, I'll post my trades to. Cheers ! Have A Great Weekend Traders

Super. We will make this strategy fly together.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Wow thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Certainly looks interesting. One enters a little than earlier than in most systems, but that is the interesting feature. Seems like a great way to get a head start. Thanks much.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Precisely - a bit earlier. But I also think that the signals are more reliable than in many other systems.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi RiskFigther. Thank you for posting ur system. I would like to check with you on attached. Are they meant to be valid Sell and Buy signal that turned out to be a loss. Or any reason that we should avoid those setups.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I am not sure that you git it right. On this picture I have painted red dots at buy and sell. Two dots on each. The first is an early signal and number two is a more powerfull signal. I have lined the profit track. But that depend of your exit strategy of cause. But there is posibility for a big profit in both cases. An SL is on latest swing. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Please, when the market open, post the screen of your trade so we can see the real system. ok? tanks in advance

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Sure. I will post all trades. However there were no entry signals today. And that is how it is. Because pairs often are trending and on Daily timeframe, the signals are not there every day. The god news is then, that you often can run the positions for some time and get some lovely pips. I will trade on the 1H today - on a demo and hopefully get some trades that I can post here.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
how did you filter out the losing trades circled? These transactions also fit the rules of the system. Have you accepted losses, or is there a filter? Thank you for sharing with us

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thank you for getting back to me. Lets say we didn't take the first sell trade that you have marked on chart. In that case what i marked is a valid buy set up (green circle) ? Previous candles reached bottom band and candle crossed 5 ema (blue line). I like the simplicity of this system and i want to make sure i get this right. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
So there were no trades on the Daily today. But I am investigating the 1 hour TF on a demo. Please understand, that this thread is about trading on the Daily. Lower timeframes are more unstabel. Therefore do not judge if I make loosers on H1!!!! Here is the first setup on 1H today. Price closed below SMA5 and was above Upper Bollinger Band 2 bars ago. A clear setup. But against the trend and there is a probability, that it will bounce upwards on the 50EMA, so also dangerous. But again - this is demo and it does show the setup on strategy is. Note that I was a little late. Drinking coffe with my wife and this is only demo. Stoploss 50 pips = 500 points. Risk 1% = 40$. So if I lose this one, I know that I will only lose 40$. I cannot lose anymore. This is exactly what Risk Management is about.

Please share EA BollingerMA_1 thk

Coming - not finished yet. I hope sometime this week.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Got one more signal. This time I remembered to buy 2 entries. To be honest, I don't think that the strategy is good on H1. It would need something more to add confluence. Any Ideas?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello! I find this system very interesting. Maybe for TF less than D1 it would be convenient to add a RSI 5 with level 50 to filter entries? Or a stochastic 5-3-3? I will follow the thread very carefully.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
No trades on the Daily today. On H1 I traded 3 pairs, 2 portions of 1% risk of each: EURCHF #1 tp at 1:1. #2 still running. GBPCHF Lost both portions NZDCAD #1 tp at 1:1 #2 hit break even. So I got TP on 2 and SL on 2. That is zero profit. And I got one running where break even has been set. Now the SAR har started up and I start trailing. So all in all some profit is secured for the trades today at H1. The risk at using SAR for trailing is, that it is no good at ranging circumstances, so I need a trend starting up in order to get some nice profit.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
My trade yesterday on D1. 20:31 GMT

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Good day. Probably I didn't get some rules of the strategy. Could you explain me why you didn't enter the circles?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yes. Look at the text in the post: I have only showed the BUY trades. But look at it, there are some very fine SELL trades, even if the trend is upwards. But be sure to have risk management in place and be sure to set SL at break even as soon as possible. So you are very right about the signals that you have circled.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Nice Night. You have really understood the strategy. Are those exit profit or are the trades still running?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Got it. Thanks. So inattentive... I like D1 systems. Wanna try your system.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Super :-)

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Add next trade sell today?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Jep, that looks great. Lets see at the end of day.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Today I opened 8 positions on 4 pairs. Only EURGBP was opened after the signal the rest had to be opened earlier but the price pulled back so I opened them. SL is the swing low/high and the first trade has got R:R 1:1 and the second has got trailing stop equals to SL. It seems for me that we have to open trades in the direction of weekly trend. Only EURGBP is opened in this direction.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Hadosh Nice to hear from you and your suggestion. I agree that there seem to be a problem. One thing to do would be to trade only in the direction of the daily as you suggest. Please follow that lead and let's see how fine it is. The problem is, that in a very strong trend, the bars will stay in one half of the bollinger band. During such a trend the bars will make numerous crosses back and forth on the 5SMA. And all signals will be false. See the attachment. The marked rectangle shows the problem. My take on the problem will be to not trade a very strong trending pair. I want to se that the trend is broken before that pair is again a subject for my trading. Furthermore I have set up a Stocastic on my charts (14,3,3) to confirm trades. It is clearly to see how the stochastic has also problems during a very strong trend. The good news is, that when we sometimes are lucky to catch the beginning of such a strong trend, then we can follow it until the middle of the Bollinger has been crossed. I took some trades today. I will put it up on FF later.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Today opened 2 positions (1 pair). I saw one more pair but it was against weekly trend.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Interesant..

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I saw this kind of system. The problem of the arrows is that they repain. They do not disappear they appear after some time. Probably I'm wrong. I will try to test it in the evening.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
To check this system on lower timeframes... like 15mins or 1hr do we need to caliber to suite smaller timeframe setup? example Bollinger period 20, MA period 50 and MA period 5 given for Daily charts.. this setup needs to be changed for smaller timeframe trades? kindly suggest... then I will test this strategy and post the results Gw.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
On your example on post #1 you said that the 50EMA is the trendline and we must trade in direction of this 50EMA but on your chart below there are 3 BUY trades with a 50EMA down, is it a mistake? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I was mistaken. I didn't notice appearance of the arrows. I tested it in tester and didn't notice it.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
So far this strategy has save man this week and it look promising.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You must make a straight line that represent the 50EMA and then it is a line that is trending up. I don't think of the trend as ended just because there is a small bow down here and there. I look at the overall picture.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
As I mentioned in post #1, this thread has the purpose of reinventing the very first BK8 trade. I made som fine trades last week, but there were many trades that I did not take, because a Short signal in a steep uptrending curve seems to me to be hazardeus. And they were. Their are many false signals in steep trends. Therefore I will from now on only take trades which cross both SMA5 and EMA50. This is because that these trades have a very high probability to reprecent bouncing trades on the EMA50 which is the trend. I think that this is the sevret formula to succes. Then there will be fewer trades. Therefore I will now trade on the 4H time frame in order to get enough trades.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Take a look at this picture. I have loaded one of my favorit indicators into the chart - Smoothed Heikin Ashi. It runs smootly within the Bollinger bands. It can support when to take a trade and when to exit. When SHA change colour. When a bar cross the SHA bars into a direction change. Allthough if a large bar cross the SHA, then it often turns out, that the next bar goes right back again. But I think it is worth analysing that tool in this connection. Sorry for the colours. You might wish to change colours on SHA.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I know, I have not uploaded my trades yet. I have my own trading to look after too. It will come.

Take a look at this chart. It is the Daily chart. During the last half year there were only 2 times, when the price went below the 50EMA. In both the price went up again and it turned out, that it was a bounce to the EMA50. And there were loads of pips in the time after. Those bounces are the most trustable signals we have, especially in a trending chart. But when will it bounce and when will it break down. The tool is to wait for a coming break up on the EMA50 and SMA5 - AND the price must have been closed below the EMA50 and below the lower Bollinger band. But 2 signals in a half year - can you make a living of that?? Well - statistically it will be 4 trades in a year (with a lot of pips). I trade all 28 FOREX pairs. 4 trades per pair. Then you have 112 trades a year - with at lot of pips and with a high trustability. Still - I trade the Daily. But somebody might use this on smaller timeframes and let us know of the experiences. This is from now on my strategy with this thread. I will not alter post 1 just now. I will wait to see if we get a discussion of the subject and maybe and improvement.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
That is a very nice trade. Personally I am not a RSI man myself. But it is a fine trade. I hope you will share more results.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
To be honest, forex trading is not as simple as it seems, after you practice it for several years, you still have to complete your trading tools as completely as possible and the EA, indicator or script you use must be in a system that is easy for you to read and use. and in my opinion, it can only be achieved if you build it yourself

--- 帖子 #66 ---
So, I have made a robot that can give some nice trading alerts. I need some people to test it. And the strategy has been changed since the thread started. Post 1 - 9 will be updated.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
if you can make something like this and you share free in threat that's great Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #68 ---
dear RiskFighter , i ll be happy to test it too just what best time frame would be better to use

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I believe he wrote about 4-5 times that he is trading this Strategy on the Daily Timeframe, so what do you think based on that, which timeframe he thinks its the best to use the Strategy on? Right!! the 1Minute chart!! good job

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Yesterday my robot gave signal on 3 pairs. They can all be traded, but 2 of them were against the trend, so I chosed the one that goes with the trend. I would have liked the old bar to close above the upper bollinger band, but I think in this case that it is ok whith the high being over the band. Also if you want to be more secure, it is adviseable to await the stochastic closing below 80. So these are the signals that you will get from the robot.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Personally I trade the Daily for the moment. But I think that it would be nice if some of the people in this thread would try it on all other timeframes, because it should work. And in smaller timeframes you get more signals and will be able to throw away more and only trade the very best. I am working on describing several strategies and you will receive a PDF document also, that I want you to comment on. I found some small things that I want to change in the robot and I am very busy right now with other stuff, so the test will wait until the 7. of october. In the attachement you need to click on it, because the colours are bad chosen. That is one of the things I must change in the robot.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
By the way I want to stress, that this is not commercial and it will never be!! I will not releace the code, but the robot will allways be free.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Is there anybody who does not have a working job? I would like to sit some days during London and NY times and trade while exchanging trades and views on the market in real time with some people. Not every day though. Of cause we shold use the BMA strategy but other indicators to give confluences are very welcome in a trial to improve the strategy. We should use the robot which I will release very soon.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Just a suggestion, you have to add 1 more indicator as a counterbalance, so the decision to open close orders has 2 conditions: if MA2 crosses with the BB midline and the condition of the 2nd indicator if not maybe your EA is less than the maximum

--- 帖子 #75 ---
No, that is another strategy. The BB midline is not part of this strategy at all. In my strategy we cross first the upper/lower BB line and then the EMA50 - which is the trendline. So the best signal is when the signal make a draw back to the trendline and then bounce - crossing the BB Upper/lower band and the EMA50. That is a very strong trend continuation signal. In addition we use the stocastich whis must cross to 20/80 levels. Together these signals are much more powerfull than the BB midline.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I would be interested to exchange some trading ideas! I am rather busy myself though with trading and and and. So it might not happen very often.. I would be still open to get on a call a few times a month!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Super. I will be able to trade the full day a couple of days in the week. I am not working but doing a lot of other stuff. Let's see if more people turns up.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Got an idea today. My BMA robot can be put on multiple charts. But it only give alerts on the timeframe that the chart has. I should make it showing a list on all charts existing on the profile - on a set of multiple timeframes for each chart and it should at the same time for each signal show the degree of trending on all timeframes on that chart/pair. That would be very nice. Well, I am a fast coder but I am doing a lot of different things in my life and there are some new programming areas in this for me, so it will take at least another month before I have made this.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
in my opinion, there can not be one singble indicator or any one system which can measure all stages of market movements and provide profitable entries and exits. mostly trending indicators look fine but we need robust one during consolidations.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Just don't trade during consolidations.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Easy to say xD

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I know.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
OK, I think the robot is ready. So I will make a massive test today. I have 3 screens. I close all real money trading windows and put a demoaccount on each screen. Use timeframes on the 3 screens - M15, 1H and 4H. All 28 FOREX pairs on each account = screen. This gives 84 charts which all have my robot. I hate to trade anything less than 1H, but this is a test. I expect more than 100 signals. I will take only trades where 50EMA is shoving a trend. And I hope this way, that I will be able to get some bounce trades in the direction of the trend. Each trade will have a risk at 1% and I will set the SL as trailing right away. I know that it is common, that trades pull back and that I will lose some trades that way, but the trailing will minimize those losses. So as my hope is to identify pullback/bounce trades and as I am setting a trailing stop, this will be trades that identify the swings and run the trade until stopped out. Some of the trades should be able to run for nice winnings. I will start at London open. Trade for a coupl of hours. Check the 4H if there are any trades, take a pause and the start again at NY open. So I will have an exiting day at my desk. If the robot behaves, I will release it tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Great news RiskFighter, I am following the BK8's system and yours as well. Looking forward to see your backtest results.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
1st. trade today. The H1 timeframe. Normally I would want the 50EMA to be more steep, but the Bollinger shows a trend. So let us see and be more wise when the trade closes. A 1% risk has been set with a trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Aaaarrgh - I totally forgot to set up the Stochastic for confluense. Luckyly it is with me in this trade!!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
In the original BK8 strategy I think the the Mid bollinger band had som influence on when to trade. I use EMA50 in stead in order to get quicker into the trade. But it is a very good sign if my trade cross that Mid Bollinger band. Until that happens, the trade is still unsecure. I am not there yet.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
So this is the kind of alert that you get when a signal is present. I right now have decided to change this. I will make the robot to color the background of a chart which have a signal. That will be faster and easier to spot.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
OK, still had an error in the robot. I made changes in the weekend and at weekend the brokers close the trading servers, so programming made in the weekend cannot be tested. This means that I had very few signals this morning. I have now corrected the error and I made the new idea I had. So in stead of reading the alerts, you now get an alert by the robot painting the background of the chart SteelBlue. This is easy!!! The darker blue is when you own the pair long. And I paint it red when you own it short. BUT, I have made it possible for the user to changes those colours to your own likes in the parameter setting.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
So here is how the trailing stop works. I can no longer lose money on this trade. The downside is, that I am trailing a bit close to the price. I could increase the trail. Or I could manually set the SL to the EMA50. But for now, I will let the trail run.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
The day has not been perfect. And I have to stop soon. But I want to show you a setup that I got just now on H1, because this is exactly the setup that I am looking for. Note that it is a nice downtrend. A nice big signal bar. Stochastics is passing below 80. Risk 1% of the account balance and trailing stop has been set to 1%. I don't like the dobbelt buttom, but think the trend is strong enough to break that. I had errors in the robot which took away focus at the London timeslot. Tomorrow we have a government election i Denmark and I will not trade before NY Open. I will send out the robot tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks, i will test this strategy with small live account

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Start on demo. You will have to get used to it first.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I usually use a combination of BOLLINGER BANDS and VOLUME to look for the best opportunities, I even created an indicator of the way I see the market. Incredibly, no error, yes the indicator is 100% of use. the operation is for only 1 candle, the same one in which the arrow appears as shown in the photo.

Here comes the robot and a document explaining how it works.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thank you for sharing. This looks fine. I have tried using volumes too, but never semed to get much out of it. What is the value of the volume that must exist when you are allowed to take a cross trade from the bollinger boundaries? I see that this is your first post. Have you never been on Forex Factory before?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
yes, it's the first time here on this forum, unfortunately I was banned from being in forums because I work in a well-known bank, now I enjoy my freedom and so I started to program some ideas that I used to do for institutions, this can put some money in my pocket and guarantee the quality of life I've always had, so I thought it was a good idea. I tried to transcribe it into metatrader language because it is popular and I believe that my tool will reach as many people as possible. about volume conditions, I think we can open a topic just to create and post ideas and tools about it, the content is very good.

Sounds fine. I think such a topic would be great! Please make it. Wellcome then in the club. I am just a pensioned Engineer that loves programming and trading.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thx for contributing; the volume indicator looks similar to the Waddahattarexplosion (WAE volume indicator) which I use on the Daily or H4 TFs.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Volume conditions?, there is no volume data in forex and as a ex banker - surely you know that. I don’t think your’e being honest about your background. However, tick volume is workable for some traders so please call it by its real name so there’s no confusion. I better be positive now and suggest a good trending Bollinger Band set up is using two different bands based on 38/2 and 38/1. Works well in a EA, worth a try. Good luck everyone

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Could you perhaps elaborate a bit more on the trading set up one would look for using the double bands?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Jeps, and I have tried that indicator, but it seemed to me that it was allways positive when my other indicators were positive. It never stopped me from taking a trade. But there a many people that likes that indicator, so I am very currious about what I am missing.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Thanks Rick I will try that for sure. Just a bit too busy right now. But I will! Maybe you could share some results?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Agree. Would be very interesting.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
the volume used is from the metatrader itself, just change the colors to match the template.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I imagine that it is not necessary to exemplify here about the type of volume used in forex. volume ticks is also volume as the name implies. perhaps the information that you don't currently have is that the network that the banking market trades is not the same for ordinary traders as I am now. so yes, in forex there is real volume being traded on the proper network which is not the same one currently used by me and you. my tool doesn't require a change of strategies, because as stated earlier, it doesn't make mistakes, ever. just as an institutional player will never make a mistake unless it is a bluff using the real volume on the appropriate network that apparently until now you were unaware of. but don't worry, there is always time to seek knowledge, abandon the ego and be on the side of those who have the information we need.

Hi Risk Fighter, The EA works fine but doesn't send an alert to my phone, just shows up on the terminal. Is this normal?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Monday and Tuesday I have been trading most of the signals that the BMA robot has provided in order to catch errors. Now I begin to trade only the very best of the signals and I close the day when I have a profit of 1/2% og the beginning account balance. But how di I find the best trades. Of cause there are the signal from BMA robot, the steepnes of the EMA50, the confluence from the stochastic and the multiple timeframe analysis. But I have more. It is NOT part of this thread, but I will mention it. We all know several strategies which we like but do not trade. I have found a Dashboard somewhere and I changed it so that if you push the button of a pair, then all charts are changed to that pair. I don't know if such a dashboard exist (with the change all pairs function) anywhere. I cannot share my creation, because it has several flaws - which I can live with but my reputation cannot live with me releasing it officially. So I place a number of charts on the screen. On each chart I put some indicators that I like. Then I can watch the current situation on a specific pair using different strategies. Se the examples attached. On the last picture you can see how the Dashboard changes all the charts to the same pair.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Jep, that is the intention. And I could use a lot of time making it a Rolls Royce, but it does the job and it is fine for me. I have done a little to other users by making it possible to change colours after your likings, but I will not use a lot of time to develop it further. The intention is to use it when you have several screens filled with charts. On a bar close you can have an alert - or better the charts that have a signal for you are coloured. You JUST DON`T NEED - to sit and stare on al the charts. Chose the few that have a colour. And if you want to nurse trades that you are in - those trades also has a colour. So the robot makes life easy when you are at the computer.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
So this is the chart it would paint. Can you point into a direction where we can find the rules to trade it?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
An error in the robot: It was not possible to switch of Alert on the screen. It is corrected now.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I use the WAE for confluence to keep me out when volume is below the threshold line(Dead Zone line). With the sensitivity set to 150. The high lighted area shows low volume.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Please what using colors ??

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hello friend, I've been watching the post and I would like you to take a look at the indicator I'm posting here, I think these trends can be better taken advantage of once again observing supply and demand through volume, Knowing where the price wants to go, I usedthe bollinger as a buyer or seller limit, of course, always observing supply and demand through volume. A small RSI filter to limit some false signals or traps.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I use the colours that comes with the robot. Feel free to experiment.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thank you for your input. I note your use of Volume. But I think that often signals starts before the volume - they call it the smart money. My strategy - and tool looks at the trend and a possible bounce from the trendline - EMA50. Of cause a look at the Volume would not hurt. And where you use RSI, I use Stochastichs. This is a thread where we want to hear a lot of different ways, so as I think that your strategy is good I wellcome it to the thread!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
It is not possible to see the trades.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Cannot see your trades, but if you traded the H4 then this trade is very well chosen on NZDJPY. (Idon't trade Gold). I would say "wait for the second green bar, because the first one is to week.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Oh, I see that you trade M15. Then it would be this fantastic trade. R:R = 1:5 at it's highest, but it is still running. And everything was nicely in place. The trend was fine. A close below the lower Bollinger band. EMA50 was broken. Stochastics was supporting the trade. A bounce of the EMA50 was likely. This is exactly the power of this strategy! Well done Night63.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Just one trade every day like this. Can you guys see your future? And you get many signals to choose from. They are served to you by my robot. You don't even have to find them your self. Just wait - be passionate - wait for the best trade. It will come some time during the day. Let me see some more of your trades here at this thread. And let us discuss why it worked - or didn't.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Im start trade on TF H4 Switch on TF M15 for exit trade.....

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Pls What Different color? Today set.. if on D1 the yellow line is below the channel, open a trade??

--- 帖子 #128 ---
The trade of the day. R:R = 1:1. Risk = 1% of the account, then profit = 1% of the account.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
NO - don't take that trade. The purpose of the strategy is to find the exact point when the price bounce on the trendline. In your case it does not bounce on the trende line. The price must ALLWAYS cross the trendline (EMA50) for a signal - and the price must have crossed the Bollinger border line within the last 5 bars. The weakness is, that there are many, many bounces to the trend line, where the price did not cross the Bollinger border line and therefore there are nice rallys that we don´t get. But that is trading in a nutshell - we don't get all the fine trades.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
So lets make a little contest for all followers. Tomorrow = Tuesday make a trade using this strategy AND share it here in the thread. Do share it right away when you have taken the trade in order for other traders to benefit of your trade discovery. Don't care if it is real money or demo. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- By the way I am in the proces of setting up a PROP account using this strategy and robot. My take on it: One trade a day with a reward of 0.5%. But if there are up to 4 good setups, I will take them all. Trailing SL on 1%. So exit the trade at a 0.5% profit - but if the trade seems strong then I might let it run. Prop firm I use is MFF.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Please add in EA ALERT TO MOBILE MT4..... thk Thk THK!!!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Please ADD send PAIR + TF

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Yes will do that.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
A nice signal which I did NOT trade because the Bollinger was ranging. But it illuminates that many fine trades starts from ranging and we should not be so afraid. This trade would have given me the 0.5% that I want every day.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I took 3 trades right now at M30. EURGBP Short NZDCAD and NZDUSD Long. (Should only have taken one of them)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Today it took 9 minutes to profit 0.5% of the account balance. I have also an account running that profit 1%. This was actuated after 20 minutes. I have a robot that is closing all open trades when the goal is reached. And I don't trade anymore that day. So I have the rest of the day off :-).

--- 帖子 #142 ---
So an update to the robot. Now showing timeframe and instrument on the mobile phone.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thanks for sharing this strategy Is there a way to visualize trade signals on the chart? For backtesting purposes...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
@RiskFighter - first of all thank you for sharing the system. I am new to forex trading and studying different strategies. Yours trading on Daily candle seems less tensed. These are the trades I just took on my demo account. Traders - If there any mistake kindly let me know. Total 6 entries taken 4 Buy and 2 Sell positions.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
No. Visualizing can only be made on indicators and this is a robot.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Use the robot. All signals will then be correct. But not all should be traded. You still have to check stochastics and multi timeframe analyzes. And the signal bars should be of a significant size. And EMA50 should have been trending for a while. Your EURAUD trade is not right and I surely hope that there were not a robot signal.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thank RiskFighter

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Aranneera, what's the name of the bottom dashboard?

Yesterday PLS if possible EA Bollinger_5 for MT5 ??

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Can you please shed more light on Robot? I did not get any signal notification from the robot (I've attached it on demo account a day before and till now no signal notification). Do I need to change anything in settings? Chart window colour as you shown in recent posts 'Blue' and 'maroon' is that the signal to trade? till now none of my 22 pair chart window changed its colour. kindly explain.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
That is symbol changer indicator. Works very smooth.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Nice catch ;O)

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I do not work in MT5 and I never will.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
There are 2 possible problems. 1) You have not set the chart to Autotrading. Even if the tool doesn't trade then it is a robot and can only function with AutoTrading . 2) See setting also at the attachment. Allow live trading must be marked.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #158 ---
This days hard work. I used most of the day at the dentist. Came home right when a nice trade came up. Took the trade and 10 minutes later the daily 0.5% were done. The 1% chart is close to profit also. Then I have the rest of the day off. It is hard to be a trader ;O).

--- 帖子 #159 ---
This is the best chart changer I have seen. However it needs an empty sub window. I made such a thing so it is attached here. Note it must be situated in the Indicator folder.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
pls question.. If Im open an order and the trade goes the opposite way EA didn't she already send other signals? The background color is the same as the color of the open order?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
No. A signal in the opposite direction would only happen in a small range condition. Don't rely on the robot to give exit signals. That would blow your account.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
The indicator is not showing in indicator folder after copying it. Please what am I doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hello RiskFighter Does MA5 play any role in the signals generated by the EA? Or is it MA50 only?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I have gone away from MA5. It is directly dangerous to use without EMA50 and then it has no role to play.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Which indicator are you talking about?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
That is EA BollingerMA_5 needs to be placed in "Experts" folder. After pasting it in experts folder then rightclick and refresh on Navigator section on your mt4 terminal. You will be able to see under "Expert Advisors"

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Welcome! Is't possible to view previous alerts in 'Alerts" Section on mt4? dont know why our notification/alerts are not recorded there!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
That is because I coded it as an EA - I like to say robot. Previous alrts need some special coding which can only be made in indicators.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thanks for your response. I did copy it to expert folder but still not showing. These are the steps I took: From File&gt;Open Data Folder&gt;MQL5&gt;Experts&gt;Advisors Maybe I got a all wrong. Kindly help me look into it.

--- 帖子 #170 ---

There is not a BMA buy signal in that chart. It is very important that there were a crossUp of the LowBollinger boarder within the last 5 bars. If not, then it is not a trend bouncing trade and you will often come into the trade too late.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Guys - a little advertising: How to make every trading week profitable . That thread is most interesting.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I am trading 3 account with this strategy right now, mainly to study different ways of exit. Right now I had a signal on 2 of those account but not on the third. The third account is a prop account with a different broker, but it should no make any difference. And set up is the same and other signals are coming on all 3 account. Quite weird. Just wanted to tell, that such weird things might happen and there is nothing to do about it.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I am about to challenge mff fund with this system, hope to pass within 2 weeks

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Super. I just started an MFF with it. I take 0.5% every day, so it will be 16 days for me.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Then again, there are days with no signals - like today. So we will see.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I think it is time to throw in one more tool which I have invented and programmed. Bollinger Bands is a tool with many functions. One of them is telling if a pair is ranging or tranding. If the outer bands are not widening, then the pair is in a range condition. But if the bands ARE widening, then a trend is upcoming or ongoing. As most indicators works either in a trending condition or a range, this Bollinger function is very important. BUT - take a look at the bollinger bands. When are they widening and when are they showing a range is coming? I allways found it difficult to judge those bands. So I made an indicator. I named the indicator BollingerMomentum. (No I am not giving away the code). It is measuring the average of the bands n bars backwards. You can set that value in the settings. It is named MA_Length. There are 4 colours which give the condition on the last closed bar (n=1): DarkGreen: Bollinger Bands are widening compared to the average of the last n bars. A trend is ongoing or might be upcoming. LightGreen: Bollinger Bands are wider than the average of the last n bars. But are not widening any further at this moment. LightRed: The last width of the Bands are now smaller than the width of the average of the last n bars. Ranging should be expected. DarkRed: The last width of the Bands was widening, but it was still more narrow than the average of the last n bars. This is an early warning of a possible trend upcoming and might lead to a DarkGreen colour soon. The reason that I bring this indicator in play right now is, that I am seeking the ultimate method to exit from the trades that I make on the daily bars. When the colour goes from DarkGreen to LightGreen you should be aware and ready to take profit. Yes, you will often see, that the colour goes back to DarkGreen again. There are no 100% recipie of knowing what will happen at the next bar. If the colour change from Green to Red, then I definately will exit the position right away. But But - as with all indicators the picture will be different caused by the number of bars that you look back - set by MA_Length. Here is a possibility to experiment. Note: The indicator is based on Bollinger Bands, so uncertainties is not because of a bad tool, it is because of the Bollinger Bands behavior. Note!!! Widening of the Bollinger Bands tells you NOTHING about the direction of the trend - up or down. And you can easily experience a continued DarkGreen colour even if the trend is changing. This acknowledge, that the new direction is valid. So DO NOT fall into sleep if the colour is DarkGreen. A change in direction might then cheet you. And Note! The nature of this tool is not that it gives nice reliable signals. It merely provides times where you should think about the investment you have. Danger might be coming or oppotunities might come. But other indicators shall be your lead and BollingerMomentum a support.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I got my red diamond today. I am very honoured! Thank you.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Watch this situation. Trend is changing, but since the Bollinger Bands are still widening, then the colour is still green. This is a trap. Do not fall into it.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Adding a new rule to the strategy. The purpose of the strategy is toshow the bounces of the trendline EMA50. It is then fair to require that the EMA50 must be in the side of the bands where the BB cross is situated. On the picture below I traded short an EMA Cross which was in the opposite band and it is clear that this is a bad startingpoint.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Today was nice - as expected. My Prop account goes well. Some demo accounts I use for test has done well. I have the theory, that whenever you find a bounce from the trendline it is kind of a spark. The signal might go wrong over time, but in the beginning you can count on the signal. So risking 1% and take profit at 0.5% should be a success. So today I took some trades whenever I was at the computer. Of cause on a demo account. I did not analyse anything and I traded all the signals I got from the BMA. No matter if they were with the trend, against the trend, in a range or just looking bad. Again only when I was present at the computer. So I made 9 trades. 8 of them was a succes. And I think this is a possible road. Take all the signals you can get and exit after TP = 0.5%. I am testing that theory for the time being. The table below shows the day. The result is 3% profit of the starting balance. And that was 9 trades not filteret or sortet at all. I think there will be in the area of 30 BMA signals today.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Sorry if I missed it, what timeframe do you trade on for your prop firm account? And amazing work! Thanks for sharing all of your thoughts and even more! I may not write much in this Thread, but I am always looking forward to your messages.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hello Roskfighter, this is my first post here. Thank you for the great EA, it looks really professional. I wanted to test it on a demo account but i am not getting any signals I just get the charts, do you have any advice?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi RiskFighter, what the timeframe you use?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi TDT At the Prop I use M30. The reason is, that I want minimum 1 very fine trade every day. That is not possible at higher TF. Taking 0.5% it will be 16 trades to get the 8% needed at the Prop account first evaluation phase. (Normally don´t trade on fridays though). Risk allways 1%. That way I will never hit the 5% DD which will blow my account. And the 12% overall DD is much unlikely. Yes a bad R:R, but it is very much likely that I get the .5% every day. And 0.5% will sum up in 10% a month. That is fine for now. But I could take up to 4 trades every day. Just remember that if the account is in 3% profit then the DD at 5% lies at only 2% under the starting balance. That is a trap. You can avoid it by setting the 1% risk as a trailing stop. Daily is my favorit, but there are way to few trades. On daily I use the BollingerMomentum as exit indicator. This a a real money account, but with very few money on it. Then I am running a demo account to test R:R = 1:1 om H1. Also 1 or a few trades everyday. Finally I started yesterday a demo account where I blindly take all signals the BMA sends me and closing them on 0.5% profit on each trade. Of cause only when I am at my trading desk. As in post 183.

--- 帖子 #188 ---

Was away this morning. But a nice trade belled my mobile exactly when I stepped into the house. Hopefully that is this days trade. Edit: Exit. It took 27 minutes today. I really feel I am working hard. Doing this every day, I will gain 10% a month. When I get happy after doing this some time, I will increase the risk to 2%. Then I gain 20% a month. OOoooops - here comes another fine trade. Oh well, then I take one more. AUDJPY.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Thank you for sharing this great topic. I have a question, when we receive a signal from the EA, do we continue to wait for the entry point, or will we enter the order as soon as the EA says it. Because I don't understand Short Color and Long Color is that when entering the command, it will show the color, or if there is an order, it will notify me. sorry about my english

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thanks for the question which gives me the possibility to explain the colours. But first. When you have a signal from the robot - THEN THE TRADE IS READY TO BE TAKEN. It is that easy. But then again, nothing is easy in trading. I mainly trade the 30 minute timeframe for now. Not because I like it, but because I can be sure of having a trade every day. I can be sure of getting minimum 25 signals at the M30 on a normal day. But signal on M30 a faithless. Some of them change direction right away and it is your job to find the very best signal or signals that day. So getting the signal is not enough. You must also consider: Is the pair in a nice steep trend? Is the stochastic supporting the signal? How are the the upper timeframes doing? Is the signal bar nice and strong? If the signalbar is not strong, then make a note at your paper and await next bar to see what happens. As the robot is identifying bouncing signals, it must be a strong reaction at some time. Otherwise it might be on its way to ranging. When you get a signal and your analyzis tells you to take the trade, then the background colour will change. BUT - not right away. Only when the trading bar has closed and a new one has started. There are these colours: A colour a signal is present. A colour for owning the pair Long. A colour for owning the pair Short. A colour for owning the pair in both directions (Hedging). A colour for no action at all. Change the colours to your likings at the setting menu. What are the colours for?? It is just to help you having the feeling with you portfolio. With the colouring you can IN JUST ONE GLANCE, see which pairs you own. It is then quickly to open charts for managing your trades. If you don't want to use the background colouring, just switch it of by setting BGColours to "0". I hope this clarifies. Otherwise ask again.

Hi That was a very fine trade. It is a huge break out to the long side. However there were no BMA signal on H1.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
So it's Friday. Hate fridays. Means no trading until Monday. What is the status of my PROP account? Could be better. I had a loss. An unnessesary one. I stepped out too early from 2 trades. But in profit though. But hey - only 1 loosing day and 6 profit days. It really is OK. BMA seems to be a fine tool.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hey RF, what prop firm are you using?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
MFF. As You. They have the best setups.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Aranneera In post 209 I said, that you made a fine trade, but there were no BMA signal. And that is still true. But I have today updated Post #1 and discovered a flaw in the text. I can see, that you are doing how Post #1 tells, so this is my fault. The line I have edited is this: EMA50 Must be crossed within 3 - 5 bars after crossing over the Bollinger side band. Otherwise find another trade. I think that you should read post 1 again. Because of this requirement there are many, many signals that BMA doesn't get, but on the other side, this requirement filter out a lot of bad trades and that is vital.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
By the way, I do follow your new thread with the SA strategies, and I am impressed. But trading Price Action is not for me. I dont have the psyke to do that. Have tried many times, but even on demo accounts I am constantly peeing my trouses :O(. So for me I need to get signals that I can trust and after analyzing the signal I might take it. Then a stop loss and take profit strategy that I know will work. Then I have no problem i manually trading. But I'd better leave the computer and let the SL/TP do the final work alone. I have programmed lots of robots. Don't know how many, but at least 50, maybe 100. Each with a new indicator as base. They have been trading 100% alone. I did not even need to open the computer myself. But I have concluded, that it is too hard to make a robot that makes loads of money - without loosing them again the next month. Still think it can be done, but for now I use robots as support. E.g. I have a robot that exit trades for me.

Are you using an indicator the exits or just a fixed RR with the Robot, as you ha w mentioned you are currently going for a 1:0.5R. If you are using an indicator.. would you mind to share? (I read you are using your BBMomentum indicator for the daily TF, but sounds like not for LTF?)

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Yes I am using - not an indicator - a robot. It meassures the daily profit and exit all trades when it is reached. Just because I am lazy. I cannot share it. It works together with other robots and is not a stand alone. Will not work without other things from my setup and that is too much to share But there are many of these robots around on FF. But setting a TP on the trades is just as fine.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Guys - I gave you a very fine strategy and the tools to trade it. Let me hear if anybody is trading?? Share your experiences. Are you supplying other tools to select the very best signals??

--- 帖子 #218 ---
The bollinger Indicator I use in conjunction with a moving average, which really helps me to determine bearish signals.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
The DeMarker indicator is part of the MT4 installation under the Oscillator sub-directory in the Navigator.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
As per definition price touched Bollinger band and crossed the MA. If so, following trades are per rules but ended in a loss. The green circle is a buy The red circle is a sell Is that correct @RiskFighter?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi there You have not attached any picture!

--- 帖子 #222 ---
red dots at buy and sell. Two dots on each please read and find the dots before you ask

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Thank you for this great idea, RiskFighter. I try to replace the EMA50 with Hull Moving Average 50. Please see the picture. Welcome your comments. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hull Moving Average is more responsive and smooth. I attach the hull moving average coded by myself. The setting is as following Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
This is a very fine idea. I am not sure though how it works compared to EMA50. It might catch more trades because the HULL is quicker to react than normal MA's. I will try it on back trading to see the difference. Thanks for that exiting input. I have used Hull myself a lot. Also did programe a robot that traded full automatic, but it lent data from the original indicator. Never got it to be the great winner, but I think that I am not done yet.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Now I made a walk through of your chart. According to rules this is not a trade. At least a wick must have been on the out side of the bollinger sideband within the last 5 bars. I know, the is a week spot of the strategy. On the other hand it does filter a lot of bad signals. Perfect. The Hull provide signal 1 bar before EMA and thereby gives a nice extra profit. Hull provide a signal which EMA50 does not give. Not a real signal because EMA is outside the bollinger band. I don't like that. Hull gives signal, but because of small signal bar it should not be traded. Nice signal from Hull which EMA did not give. Fake signal from Hull. Nice signal from both. Nice signal from Hull. So Hull does in this case give more signals. Profit depends of the exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
So how can we use this? It provides more signals. I am trading M30 in order to get many signals every day in order to be able to choose the best signals. But I think that H1 or greater TF is more reliable. So using Hull it would be possible to go to higher timeframes. I will try and follow that for some time.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
7. Fake signal from Hull. the second red bar touch lower band, we shouldn't short when the signal bar touch lower band, should we? lower band means lower extreme.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
You are of cause right. And I also wrote that in Post #1. So this is not a trade. However in practise I take a look at confluensers and if it is strongly supported, a nice trend etc. I take the trade anyway.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Thank you for posting the clarification. Godwilling will trade accordingly as per the new update.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
The line I have edited is this: EMA50 Must be crossed within 3 - 5 bars after crossing over the Bollinger side band. Otherwise find another trade. Is it mandatory to be from 3 bars, if you cut at bar 1 or 2, is there any trade?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Every trade that appears until the 5th. bar is valid. 1 to 3 is just better.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
@RiskFigher ...Today made overall $80 profit on my demo testing. This strategy is doing good. Only thing is when to exit/target. As you kept it open for us to decide... What I do is whenever I see $10+ total profit I close all trades manually. And wait for 'Robot' to give the next signal. Some trade I do close in negative. But overall on 0.1 Lot size - in few hrs of trading average $80 is great! Thank you Sir - May God bless.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
That is a very fine exit strategy. Nice that you get some profit. You know that I take only 1-3 trades and close for the day when I have a small profit. This is working so I will continue that. See the chart which is the trade today. I could have taken much more profit, but it works like everyday is in posive profit. But I will now open a new account with a new exit strategy. When I take a trade, it will exit whenever a bar closes outside one of the sidebands. I think most time it will be positive profit.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
So it looks like you trade all the signals is that right? You do not analyze the signals in order to only trade the best? Nothing wrong in that approach. I think it will work fine.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Yes true I take all trades.. sometimes I do check... but 90% of times I just take the trade without thinking much!

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hello Riskfighter, I've been testing on the 1 minute chart for the past two days With amazing results, you can easily secure 30-50 pips and you get lots of signals as well. But you have to be fast so close the deal in less than 5 minutes Did you get to try it?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I see you don't set stoplose, so if the price goes against the direction, how do you handle it. If I forget to close the order, my account can be burned? This way sounds interesting, I will try this way, but close the order with EA

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Very interesting! Are you taking all trades or selecting the best? What are your exit criteria?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Thread status. Many people have tried the robot / strategy, and they all seem to get profit. People have started sharing their way of using the robot. And it is most interesting and very valuable for me and everybody else. Please keep reporting!!! Profitable? RiskReward, number of trades, Timeframe, exit criteria, supporting indicators or Price Action, anything else of interest??

--- 帖子 #240 ---
during what time and which session did you try?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Yes true Risk is there! I am testing on demo only as of now and trading 0.1 lot fixed lot size for each trade. I do close negative positions as well. Also my intention is to close all if my overall M2M goes to -50$ as well. (overall profit +10$ on open positions also be closed). To be frank till now overall -$50 never went!! Also we can set SL range at Top or Bottom of BB.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Below is the Script to close all open orders (instead of closing one by one manually .. this would save your 2seconds!!) File - Open data folder - MQL4 - Scripts This is script - you need need to place this file in "Scripts" folder. once you refresh your Navigator section on mt4 you will be able to see this in scripts section.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Iam taking all trades, as it should be a very quick buy/sell. The exit criteria is a manual stop loss after profit/loss 1. Get the signal on the mobile 2. Execute 3. Watch it for a couple of minutes 4. Manual set of stop loss whether its profiting or losing, but majority of trades are winning in the past two days 63 signals in profit 9 in loss (i aim for 30-50 points profit or loss) I also noticed that the 5 minutes frame barely generates signals, so i will test the 15 minutes frame next week also.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Europe and US session Im in +3 gmt time zone so i start around 9Am and signals are valid till 10 PM After that, any entry is risky as the market is too random. Also i have noticed that the 5 minutes frame almost doesn't generate any signals, so i will try the 15 minutes TF

--- 帖子 #245 ---
SCRIPTs Change TF for all pair Change Template for all pair enjoy..

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Excuse me, does this entry follow your rules? I think it does. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Nice! I trade M30 for now. I also think that there are fewer signals than I expected.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I failed to convert your time to London time or New York time. In my experience, 1 min can be tried in Sydney session or Tokyo session. Europe session and New York session are not good for 1 min trading, too violent. violent

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Well, my rules says: The rules trendline is EMA50. Your trendline is Hull which are quicker to take a trade. Can be a plus or a minus. Here it was minus. The EMA50 might not have given a signal. Since you are not trading Forex I cannot test that. Analyze the situation and find the best trades which are trending nicely. This trade is in ranging. And a small range it is. You are trading Germany indicies, I have only developed this for Forex. Indicies often are quite dynamic. So this is not a trade I would take.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thanks for your answer. Before I play forex, then I think indicies are more stable/smooth. Indicies are combined with multiple stocks.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Exactly its violent but gets your target quickly, sydney and tokyo are too random Try 1 minute again and set you tp/sl to 50 pips Or trail manually

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I do not agree that indices are easier to play. But you are most welcome to trade as you like. I hope that you will share som results with us :-O. Maybe you can convince me.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
The pips that I use in stoploss are different from trade to trade. I set SL to the last swing or a little outside the BB sideband. Then I set TP to half the amount of pips. I have not triede M1 yet. Normally I do not trade below M30. But I will try it when I get time.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
One more point. at least a wick must have been on the out side of the bollinger sideband within the last 5 bars. I know, the is a week spot of the strategy. Your strategy means: price drops to the lower limit (lower band) in current time frame then bounces, and ema50(long term, or higher time frame) says "go up", then we enter long trade. if 1. lower limit in higher time frame &gt; lower limit in current time frame 2. price drops to lower band of higher time frame and bounces, price does not touch low band of current time frame. 3. ema50 says "go up" can we open long position? Maybe, the week spot of the strategy can be improved. thx for your reply.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
In general this strategy is about 1: The price coming home to the trendline. 2: The price is bouncing off with a strong signal bar to continue the trend. This process is supported by BB and Stochastic. This is enough to provide a lot of signals. You do not need to conciter anything else. It is ok though to look at higher timeframes to get an idea of the larger movement. But yes, you have described a week spot. I take it that your #3 means EMA50 in current timeframe. We do not get a signal from the robot then. I will say 2 things: You are allowed to trade using common sense. But in that case you are taking the trade based on a higher timeframe. But if you are getting enough signals from the robot, then why bother? Personally I will not take a trade where the wick in current timeframe has not crossed beyond the Bollinger sideband. No matter what. Thank you for this analyse and yes the strategy surely can be improved. I will work on that.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
this is what I mean. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I am a bit uncertain of what you are trying. But let me tell you, it is very seldom that an indicator gives the same signal at 2 different timeframes. And it is way to much to try and find signals that way. There are 3 possibilities in my book. You get a signal. Is it supported by THE TREND in larger TF. Then go. You get a signal. Go to a lower TF and enter a trade at first possible signal. Could be Price Action or anything else. You get a signal. Only analyze at the current TF. Is the trend steep. Is signalbar strong. Support by Stochastics. And what have you else of supporting stuff. Then you have a high possibility of a bounce from the TF. GO for it. I use #3, but does take a short look to check the trends in higher TF. If it is against the trend in HTF then I often trade it anyway. I then set e very small TP. There are cases when you get a signal with a small signalbar that manage to cross both BB sideband and EMA50. That is dangerous. Await next bars before taking the trade.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thanks for the thread the work and all the knowledge @RiskFighter I am still quite a newbie, I know the basics of course but am not into topics like SMC or wyckoff. That's why I like your strategy with clear rules very much. Do you think it's possible to make 2-3% monthly consistently over years with prop companies? You could later go to higher timeframes like the M30, just to increase the winrate.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
OK, I am trading the M30. I think there are to few signals. What to do. Some times the price does not reach out of the sidebands before the trend turn around. We will get more signals if the sidebands get closer to the middle band. But how much? Sidebands have the value 2. I will make that variable in the robot. We can then try different values. I must programme it. It will hopefully be made some times this week.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
So how is my PROP validation going? I have made 3%. Have used half of the time and I need to make 5% more. Not good enough, but I can make it. I have traded 10 days. During those days I have only had 1 day with negative profit. It was 1% negative. So it is 9 days with positive profit. There were 3 days were I did not find a signal to my like. So no trading. So I am behind the schedule. How do I get back on track? Well, I started out with risking 1% per trade. And TP was set to 0.5%. I did know, that this were likely a to small risk. I have now set my risk to 1.5%. Hence the profit is now 0.75%. If that ain't enough I can increase my risk further and thereby get a higher profit. As long as the days mostly are in profit, there is no problem in increasing the risk.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Well - Keep it simple. And I myself need very strict rules when I trade. My stummock don't like guessing! As you can see in post 260, I have made 3%. Used 19 days including weekends and days where I did not trade. But it all depends on your strategy and your diciplin. The robot gives you a lot of possible trades. You must be good at picking the best. And you must have a fine exit strategy. That really is uttermost important. Of cause start on Demo. Take all of the trades. Make a note on each trade how fine a setup you think it is. Check the result and learn. Over time you will have some material that can show you where you are good and where you need to make some improvements. Make you written strategy. Then in a phase 2, take the trades that your strategy tells you. If you are ok, then go live and make money.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
My trade on us500, I found the signal on M15, closed after 0.5% profit, 1% lot. I will get much more if I kept it. When the system alert a signal, I may open an order or ignore it, but I won't against the signal. I search signals in different time frame, and I won't trade without a signal. M30 is between M15 and H1. Therefore, I trade M15 and H1, not M30. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #263 ---
should we trade when MA50 is outside the outer boundary of BB. I see the EA giving quite a few of these signals?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Nice. I think it is a good idea to search more than one TF. I plan to make the robot do that automatically. And yes, if you do like me and take 0.5% profit, then you will have many cases where you could have gotten more. On the other hand, then the 0.5% goes nicely to the pocket. I make only one trade per day. Or more trades if the first one fails in order to get the 0.5% anyway. So this should profit about 10% a month. That is fine to me.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
You are right. And theoretical we should if the price cross the MA50. BUT I don't like it and I do not take those trades. Just my oppinion.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I've been doing testing of your idea on the us500 and eu50 Mostly just Long only buying the dips on the 4hourly chart It looks promising over the past 5 years Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Both long signal in H1 and short signal in M15 are profitable. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 11.29 14:00, there is a long signal on H1, stop at 7206. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 11.30 1:00, there is a short signal on M15, then I opened a short trade, and thought long in H1 was not valid. I closed short order at middle R1 of daily pivot points (7226). Lowest daily price is 7224 which is higher that H1 stop price, 7206. Surprisingly, price goes up, and the long signal is also profitable. So, I only open orders with signals, and hold them until stop out or make profit. I won't be threatened by price and quit in the middle.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thank you for testting. Have you any numbers written down to share? I look forward to hear from your live trades.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
He, he. That is a lesson on the many possibilities there are when you trade many timeframes. It is also a nice reminder that we do not need the trades to be aligned with all of the upper timeframes. A strong signal bar and good supporters, then go for it. Tell me - why do you have 2 hull indicators on the sheet?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Humbly joining this thread, quite an interesting strategy. Have been successful so far in testing 1:0.5 RR as per risk fighter - will keep going for two weeks in total. Definitely think we need to find a good way to exit and maximize that R:R - will start looking when I get some time.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Welcome on board. The more brains the better.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I was thinking. In this strategy we use Bollinger to confirm bounces from a trend. We could use the same strategy with other parameters where we expect bounces. It could be: Last days high/low, round numbers, confirming fibonachi levels 1.5 and 1.68, ABC patterns etc. You name it! Everywhere you expect a change in direction - just ask Bollinger if the change comes. Well - this is not a topic for this thread. Just an observation. I might use this in another strategy in another thread.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Well, I have done my trades for today. Took 1/2 hour at London open. But I am behind schedule, so I will find some trades at NY open as well.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Remember one thing. A bounce must have some power. Like if the price is banging against a wall. It means that tiny small bars crossing EMA50 and Bollinger sideband are not reliable. Wait for a larger bar to confirm the bounce.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
traditionally, if three MAs point to same direction, it's trending.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
1. how about bounce from boll(20) or boll(60)? boll(60) means boll(20) in higher time frame. 2. how about bounce from boll base line? in trending market, price stays in one side of bollinger base line, when price goes to base line, it will resume trend.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yes. All is correct. But you are talking standard Bollinger techniques. In my post I was talking about using Bollinger techniques to support actions on other indicators. This confluence is strong.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi RiskFighter, thank you for sharing this nice and simple-clear system which I just discovered today...I just started testing it on M1 to see how it behaves and it worked for me very well from 14 trades I made 9 wins and 5 loss and I picked all signals when I was behind computer. For me very solid at first glance. Will do more tests and update here. Thanks again. I have also question what do you think will this work also on Renko bars? And one more to your EA will it be possible to implement something like graphical mark like arrow to the graph to show when the alarm is notify you about possible trade to be able to back test signals visually?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Wellcome. Which exit criteria did you use. Your graphical question I have answered in an earlier post.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks for reply. I used fixed TP=4 pips. Regarding graphical question if you mean you wrote that this is EA and not indicator then ok I thouht that it is possible to leave some marks even in EA. Please answer also to my question regarding Renko. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
The organisation of an EA and an indicator is very different. So, no can't be done to my knowledge. About Renko. The biggest problem in Renko is to avoid the ranging parts. The BMA finds the bounces which leads to trending. So yes, it will be usefull for Renko users. However there will be a difference which is on the minus page. The BMA strategy counts 5 bars after crossing on the Bollinger sideband. If there were no cross on the EMA50 within those 5 bars, then go find another trade. But using Renko those 5 bars can easily be contained in one or two Renko bars. This means that BMA gives a lot more signal using Renko. And I am not sure that this is healthy. So Renko - don't know for sure. Try it and let your fellow traders know in a new post.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
EA can not mark on chart. It's difficult to evaluate EA signals. Could you please share the kernel part code? so I can adopt the logic to an indicator and mark on charts. thx

--- 帖子 #283 ---
As to my knowledge there is a way in EA to create Label Object or Text, so I think its solvable.... see here : https://docs.mql4.com/constants/obje...ject/obj_label

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Those commands are used in present times. I of cause have used them a lot during the years. But in order to go back in time and use loads of data, then you need to use indexing. I print here an example from one of the very few Indicators I have made. It is only the start of the code. Most of the commands in this short code snip cannot be used in EA's. Therefore EA's are not built to work with large amount of backword indexing data. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ #property indicator_separate_window #property indicator_buffers 8 #property strict //---- parameters input int MA_Length = 40; input bool RisingRedMomentum = false; input bool RisingGreenMomentum = false; //---- buffers double GreenBuffer[]; double DarkGreenBuffer[]; double RedBuffer[]; double DarkRedBuffer[]; double BufferMoment[]; double BufferMomentLine[]; //---- int ExtCountedBars = 0; //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Custom indicator initialization function | //|------------------------------------------------------------------| int init() { //---- indicators SetIndexStyle(0, DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 1, clrLawnGreen); SetIndexBuffer(0, GreenBuffer); SetIndexStyle(1, DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 1, clrRed); SetIndexBuffer(1, RedBuffer); SetIndexStyle(2, DRAW_LINE, 0, 1, clrRoyalBlue); SetIndexBuffer(2, BufferMoment); SetIndexStyle(3, DRAW_LINE, 0, 1, clrYellow); SetIndexBuffer(3, BufferMomentLine); SetIndexStyle(4, DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 1, clrMaroon); SetIndexBuffer(4, DarkRedBuffer); SetIndexStyle(5, DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 1, clrDarkGreen); SetIndexBuffer(5, DarkGreenBuffer);

OK. Sometime this weekend I will clean up the code and upload the MQ4 file.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
There are loads of people here on FF that are not able of programming a robot. That is a shame. So here is a tip for you: Raimund Bauer has an YouTube channel about programming. Here you can learn to program robots for free while whatching his 100+ videos. You need to know a little about coding to start with. Even better! Buy his course. It is cheap. And you don't have to know anything about programming on forehand. And you have Raimunds support. You can program your first simple robot within a few days. But of cause it takes lots of effort to become the master ;O) MQL4 TUTORIAL - SIMPLE EMA EXPERT ADVISOR - YouTube . BUT be advised - Indicators are a bit more difficult. Start with the EA's ! I should say that I do not know the man, have never spoked to him and I do not get affiliate money from him. There are many other youtubers around that teaches MQ4 robots. I just think this man is the best. Another one is Jim Dandy. But I think he is a bit more advanced.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Looking forward to you sharing the mq4 file so that we can write EAs for backtesting Looking forward to you sharing the mq4 file so that we can write EAs for backtesting

--- 帖子 #288 ---
But you cannot! The BMA strategy says that you manually must chose your trades from the signals. You should not take all signals. The BMA does not tell which of the signals you should trade. That means that the picking of trades is subjective. The BMA have no exit strategy. Then you cannot test it. So in order to fix that, you have to insert a test strategy and then it is no longer the BMA you are testing.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I think that first step must be to have the indicator that DBSDSUN makes and do some papertests. Can we find some rules or support indicators to narrow the number of signals? Can we find some exit methods that seem to work better? Can we find some instruments that are better than others? Then we might be able to program automatic buying and selling. Then we can test!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
if we have mq4 we will easily add indicators to filter. It helps us to check faster. Don't mind if you share me the mq4 file. Otherwise, thank you for the great topic

Fantastic. I think I have hit the nail with the hammer at this strategy! Thank you for this test. So what did you use for SL and TP? And was it allways M30. And did you take all signals until 14:00 or just some of them?? Thank you for the indicator. I should have printed those errors my self. Did not think about it, because I set the backgrount to a colour at signals, offer alarms both on screen and on mobile phone.

Sorry I am very busy. It will come to you.

I see from the statement that he is aiming for 20 pips as a TP.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
OK. But he only have set SL on 4 out of 12. Wonder why. I just checked. At the pairs he traded, he took everything. Only missed a few.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
How is it going - still happy?? Any development in your strategy?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Just went through the thread, and decided to give it a try on a small demo account and a new MT4 instance . The idea is to get signals and act upon them with discretion. Usually only follow 2 or 3 assets. This allows me to get plenty more opportunities (tracking 30 assets, majors, minors and gold) if I like what I see. On 2 or 3 of the trades I went against the signal because order flow or structure was developing to the other side. The signals were "just a" 1 bar pullback or mitigation of the real price direction, or I got lucky. Used M30 as-is with the "robot" to get the signals. The EA is sending only some signals, Every time the popup dialog shows up, there are more signals there then the notifications I've got. The background color change is a very nice thing. If I don't like the sl because is too far way I setup and alarm and decide what to do. Positions were 3 and 5 micros and TP between 10 and 25 pips. I decide upon the PA and near S/R zones. 10 to 25 pips in M30 are short trades. One of the goals is to get 5/6 short trades and call the day. Had a big trade loss, -$22 cause was doing too many things at the same time and had several trades open. PnL went up to 28%, then started to shrink and I closed all the trades. From the alerts dialog I got around 26/27 signals. Some in the same asset. The goal is to keep testing this system for some time and see the overall result. One day results mean nothing.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thank you very much for this deep explanation.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Here is the code. I have deleted a ton of codelines and remarks. Hope it still works. The code is not documented, because I never expected someone else to have it. But hey - this is very simple stuff. I hope someone (or more than one) will take the opportunity to improve the code with new functions. I suggest this naming if you does: BMA_VersionX_"Your profile name"

BMA M30 +40 pip

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Nice :O), But is it the BMA setup? I don't see Bollinger.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I got signal from BMA robot running on pc, 3 ema on pic just for some test ^^

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks. But does it give an alarm and just draw the arrow? Would you like to include it?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Please see my implementation. When a signal exist, it will alert, send email and send notification to mt4 on mobile (if email and notification are set up correctly). I provide both source code and running file. comments welcome @RiskFighter do you want close price cross bollinger lower, not lower price? Close[barIndex+i] &gt; bollLower[barIndex+i] not Low[barIndex+i] &gt; bollLower[barIndex+i] If you use Low[barIndex+i], there will be more signal. Now, there is not Stocastich to filter signals.

I am a bit unsure of your question. But let me explain. Say it is a short trade. We need: One bar to cross up over the bollingerHigh. It is ok if it is only the wick of the bar that gets over. It does not have to close over the band. Next and within the following 5 bars, a bar must CLOSE under both th BollingerHigh and the EMA50. And then support by Stochastich.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
There are now 2 robots which gives lots of alarms. Use one of them them. As I understand KOOK the meaning was only to have the arrows on the chart. You can have both a robot and the KOOK indi on the chart.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Yes. Thanks, but I would have tested it back. Unfortunately it doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Thanks for your explanation. -------------------------------------- while(i &gt;= 0) { if( Close[i] &gt;= iBands(NULL,0,20,2,0,PRICE_CLOSE,MODE_UPPER,i)) DownSignalLoaded = 1; if(Close[i] &lt;= iBands(NULL,0,20,2,0,PRICE_CLOSE,MODE_LOWER,i)) UpSignalLoaded = 1; i=i-1; } ------------------------------------- your code check close price. That's why I ask the question. Please see updated files in post 305.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
@RiskFighter And then support by Stochastich Sorry, I didn't find how you check Stochastic in your source code.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Yes I can see that. Thank you. Now I come to think of it, I chosed the CLOSE over the band because there is more power in the rejection of the band that way. But you are also right, many signals will be missed. Then again - do we need more signals? I have not programmed a stochastic check in the robot. I check it manually. Will of cause be easy to code it, but I prefer to watch the stochastic to see how it has behaved lately before I take a decission.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi just double checking you said 50 pips on M1? Or 50 points which is 5 pips? As my today results on M1 is a catastrophe with TP/SL=5 pips see below.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I like your Indicator and want to have this code, Can you share *.mq4 file. Thk you so much! When I attach the indicator to chart, tab expert show ...Array out of range like picture I attached below, can you help me to fix it?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Not trading since a week due to other works. Godwilling will start trading in a couple of weeks. Thank you for asking . Hope everything is going well on your side.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
My prop account is not going well My strategy was wrong, because I got more losses than expected. It is still in profit though, so I am fighting. I have had no losses this week until now.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
All strategies will definitely experience fluctuations Because the strategy is just a tool to trap profits in uncertainty As long as you keep practicing and improving your strategy, it's only a matter of time that your strategy will be more profitable

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hey These are some of the numbers I can see. Looks really nice for a simple BB model. I will try add some more features into this and show you the next test Any ideas as to what I could add into this? another filter maybe? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Did you automate the testing?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Yeah sure did. the best part about automating is that within just a few minutes I can test so many different symbols to see if any idea is a good one its next level start learning

--- 帖子 #320 ---
What are your tp and sl levels for the above test?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Very nice work ICY. Different values of EMA could be tried. DBSDSUN are using Hull Moving Average 50 in stead of EMA50. Can you try that? I think it might improve. I know it is not easy to programme Hull. I have a robot somewhere where I could find the stuff. I analysed all 28 pairs manually - I think it was monday this week. I found that: The strategy says that cross down EMA(50) must be within 5 bars from the cross down Bollinger sideband. That rule should maybe say "within 10 bars". I tested R/R at 1:1. Then it seemed that SL and TP could be 20 - 25 pips in general. Of cause it should be different for each instrument, but as a numbers game, that could maybe make a difference.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I can help with the Hull average coding.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Here for inspiration.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
@RiskFighter Would you please include the Stochastic rule in Post #1? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I expect that users of this strategy knows how to handle Stochastics as a support tool. And as I mention many place, you are wellcome to replace it with whatever tools you want.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Seems Interesting, I have been following Bk8 strategy during my long hours duty and I know RiskFighter is also inspired by him, will follow and go through with this thread... Reading Post#1

--- 帖子 #327 ---
You shall be very wellcome.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I followed BK8 in the early days. And here is the thing. When he stopped, i had a short private conversation with him. And he said " I am profitable and is trading by a living ". So the BK8 strategy were good. I think the BMA is better ;O)

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Thanks for sharing, If you're in contact with him say my Hi to him. Together We will definitely make BMA super better...

--- 帖子 #330 ---
@kook: Can you share mq4 file! Tks you!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks simple and effective but i think we need i more filter to be with the trend signal like 200 M.A

--- 帖子 #332 ---
You can make any MA your trendline and I do know, that the 200 line is very popular. Just note, that when an instrument is trending nicely over some time, then half of the trend is gone for you, if you use MA200, because the direction of the trend often starts when the price is a long way from the 200 MA that it needs to cross for you to take the trade. I never use 200 MA.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
No it was just a short conversation and we have not seen him since january 2017. I think that the BMA is a fantastic entry strategy. We just need to find the best exit. I earlier have used the MACD. Rules: When you enter the signal then MACD must go in the same direction. Then you exit at the very first histogram bar that shift direction. Yes, often that shift is temporary and you could have got more pips - but hey, you got out with profit. Buy a new trade. I will take a look at this during the coming week. Edit: Nope, does not work with this strategy.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
The above test using the Tradeview X platform was using a 20 TP and 20 SL, fairly simple, kinda works

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I agree with you especially if the the trend is going for a long time , or distence between the candels and the 200ME is far

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Yes. Risk/Reward = 1/1. And I also believe that 20 pips is aright amount of SL, TP.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Thank you for the reply, I'm busy automating the strategy with some added options for further testing, instead of having to go back. Just jammed up with work

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Took these trades today TP/SL=20 pips on M30.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
May I ask you will you be so kind and update your BollingerMA_5.ex4 according to your findings "That rule should maybe say "within 10 bars""? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
OK, but I am busy until thursday.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
10 bars is too many. or, making "the number of bars" as a input parameter. I set it as an input parameter in attached indicator. try it.

I am still busy with other matters. Will try your indicator tomorrow, and if it is good, then I don´t need to update mine ;O) Thank you for your effort!!!!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Why do I use the 50EMA in this strategy. 1. It is widely accepted as a trend line 2. The price often cross the EMA50 when it is bouncing and then cross back into a signal. This is vital for us to have the bouncing signal when it is crossing back into the trend direction. And we need the price to break both EMA50 and the Bollinger sideband. We could say that EMA is not needed. We get the signal when the price is crossing the Bollinger Sideline. That is normal Bollinger strategy. But it will give some signals that are to far away from the trend. Those signals are more likely to fail. So when we want the price to cross the EMA together with the Bollinger sideline, then we assure, that the signals are real bouncing signals from the trend and those are the most powerful signals. There are many nice price rally’s that the BMA doesn´t signal, because it does not break those 2 lines. Here is a possibility to backtest another EMA value. Also the Bollinger sidelines can be changed to smaller values. That will give more signals too, but some of the movement will be lost. Just somme thoughts.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Tried your indicator. It is perfect. Now we have real time signals and historical signals. So DBSDSUN thanks againg for your contribution.

How can I download this robot to my computer for testing, please help! Can I use it if I use MT5?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hello riskfighter and everyone else, we are failing to download MT4 therefore MQL4 is not possible for us to launch the EA your are humbly sharing for free. everytime we download the MT4 from the meta it opens as a MT5. Can we please be assisted? I also have an idea for a EA but needs someone to code it. Thank you.

If you can't work this out, you don't belong here yet

Hello, I build this scanner for the strategy from RiskFighter . It can show all symbols and time frames in one chart. It also alerts and sends email. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) setting looks like this Attached Image (click to enlarge) because the indicator will process a lot data at the beginning, it takes some time to start. Don't set too many symbols and time frames at the beginning.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
It's great and fast. I have a question, if it can be solved, the number of 50 Ema and candles could be adjusted or turned off regardless of their number. I would try other settings as well.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
***** 5 golden stars to you. Dammit you are good DBSDSUN! I was planning to make exactly that scanner - but it would have been sometime in the future. With this tool there will be a lot of possible trades and they will be easy to find.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
dbsun, you are star. Simply sensational! Thanks for the useful indicator. May I suggest using the inputs to BB, Ema and the numbers of bars? as in the previous indicator?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Excuse me Is there a setting error on my side? HK50u becomes HK50U US30u becomes US30U How to solve it? thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #358 ---
It automatically change symbols to upper case. Should it be HK50? In my MT4, it is US30, not "US30u"

--- 帖子 #359 ---

Moving average 50 and B.band is a good entry trigger and very profitable if you know how to use it in a proper way. This is last week signal on EU50 Index. I hope it does not hit my Stop Loss. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi Remax I am not with you on this one. When the price hit the opposite Bollinger sideband, then there is a large possibility that the direction will change to the opposite direction. And that is also what happened at your chart.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
But this one is great. You are very right, that Bollinger can be used as confluence to your expectancies. In your example there is a double bottom and using BB to tell if the price will bounce on the DB or break through, gives a fantastic tool. Same with all other expected moves like Fibonacci, PA etc. Wait for the BB to approve what happens.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
i cant get it to mt4. can you tell me where is it wrong? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I can tell you, because that screen shot shows code made by me. What is the name of the file that you are trying to install?? And what is the name of the directory that you will install it to??

--- 帖子 #368 ---
sorry I made a mistake downloading your file on page 292 but I'm having a bit of a problem on my computer. can you give me a full version of that great BB-EMA 50 idea? i just implemented it in tradingview. Personally, I find it very suitable for Bitcoin. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

BMA serve many signals every day. Most of them can be traded, but you need to be careful in your selection of the right signal. Here is how I do it: Risk/Reward 1:2 TF M15 Signal bar must be strong. MACD (normal setting) must support. Stochastic must be in upper/lower area or have just crossed. TF M30 and M60 Bollinger is supporting the trade by having some energy in the direction. MACD is supporting. Stochastic has a nice straight line in the direction of the trade. Take only a few but very strong trades a day. I have my phone beeping every time I get a signal. Then I use 1 minute to analyze and normally not trading. So I can easily make other things while I am trading. After the experience I have with the BMA until now, I think that this will be the best method to trade it for me. I will update Post #1 if this is conformed in the new year. Happy New Year guys and dolls :O)

--- 帖子 #370 ---
The BMA strategy is good to find the beginning of a trend. So most very long and steep trends have started with a BMA signal. See first chart. However when the trend is running, then BMA is not very good at giving signals. What to do?? See second chart. In a steep trend, the Bollinger centerline is at fine exit signal. But often the trend continues. So if you exit because of crossing the centerline, then be ready to enter again if the centerline is crossed back. As you can see - EMA50 is not part of this game and hence this is NOT part of the BMA strategy. I just wanted to show it.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Bit quiet around here, how is everybody going?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I have been very very busy with other life happenings lately. Have not traded at all. Hope to get some time to trade tomorrow. It would be nice, if people would put up some trades here. Is anybody using the BMA now after some time has gone? I use it as my primary --- aaah, I also use Ishi Moku. But that is two most different indicators and I cannot see them working together. Just nice to have more doors as the fox said.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
OK, Just for fun let us compare BMA and Ichimoku which I both play with. Here is GBPCAD. First the naked chart, then the BMA and lastly the Ichimoku. All at timeframe H4. The naked chart with only trend lines. So informative! BMA provide a Sell signal at the top . Ichimoku kind of give you a "carry on" signal. But most of the trend often has passed by then. And in this case it seems that all profit has gone at the entry time. Sorry for the colours. I am a night person and need black background. You have to open charts in a new window to see it right - by clicking 1 time at the chart. Clicking 2 times will make it yet bigger, but the chart will be cut of at the right side.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
So this afternoon - be carefull about trading USD. (My time is CET)

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Good trades have been really good, but too many bad trades. Have been going to the following Risk/Reward 1:2 TF M15 Signal bar must be strong. MACD (normal setting) must support. Stochastic must be in upper/lower area or have just crossed. TF M30 and M60 Bollinger is supporting the trade by having some energy in the direction. MACD is supporting. Stochastic has a nice straight line in the direction of the trade. Need to refine it a bit or I'm just taking bad trades

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I think I got more than 70 signals yesterday. The thing is, that this strategy give you all signals that occur near the EMA50, which I use as trend line. It sort away signals that does not happen near the trend line, because those are in danger of going the wrong way faster. So you got a bunch of signals that could be trend changing. But there are no garantee. Therefore you need to look at consolidations, as I mentioned earlier. But also use you senses. If you buy at R/R 1:2, then there must be room for that target - look in HTF. Are you buying against the trend? Any news coming soon? Are you buying right into resistance? You can also use price action. So judging the situation should make it possible to pick the very best and very few signals. Another thing is, that higher time frames are more stable. So you could move it up to H1?? Maybe 1:2 is to hard and it should be 1:1. Or maybe this strategy is not worth it at all?? I still believe in it and will continue to find the right way to trade it.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Well, still trying and I am using the BMA. But I am also using other strategies. Right now I have 7 accounts running. Some with real money and others demo for testing strategies. I have come to the conclusion, that Stochastics is an important indicator in many strategies and often you don´t need to look for trades, if the stochastic is not giving a signal. Sooo - it seemed to be a good idea to use 10 minutes to programme a stochastics alarm. As usual when I programme something, then it is for my own purpose. I am happy to share but I don´t take wishes for improvement. Take it or leave it. It uses EMA on the closed price. I just made it, so it is not tested a lot, but it is very, very simple, so I guess that it is working - otherwise let me know. Remember to put it in the indicators folder.

I like your system great trading idea i will mix it with my trading ideas or trend following using dayly bars ,how many time out of 100 the price move down or up 3 bars or more after price hit bb upper or lower bb closes above or below 50 ema?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I don't know. Nobody tried that way of using it. Sounds very interesting. Let me know if you find it useable that way. The thing is, that it makes plenty of signals and they must be filtered. But then it is splended to find the trend changes. It is on the other hand very bad to follow an ongoing steep trend. If your 3 bar system works, then I can make a robot that trades automatically - or just give the filtered signals. But you must test it first.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
OK - there were many people that tried this robot in the beginning and they were very positive. But the thread seems to have died. There are two problems right now with the BMA. 1) It needs som sorting away the bad trades and 2) it is not good at identifying the very best trades in steep trends. On the other hand it is very good to identify the beginning of the trends and the is worth a lot. So, I still believe in the BMA. But nobody are participating in the work, so it ends here. I will develop further myself. My next project is a pattern recognizer. See this thread: Pattern robot | Forex Factory . It needs developing but I find it usefull allready in my daily trading.

120 people have downloaded it - nothing I can do, sorry. However the latest version is Bollinger MA version 6. So read a little further.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Help me please

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Have you succesfully downloaded other indicators before?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
When you click on the file, do you then get this download table?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
. no i dont get a download table

--- 帖子 #239 ---
OK - you are really a beginner. If you use microsoft EDGE as browser, here is some hints. Look at the attached picture. You find that menu in the uppe right of your screen. Click on the "...". And you get a menu, where you find the "Download" button. Click that button and the recent downloads appear. Move the indicator to your Indicator library in MT4. Open the Navigator in MT4. Right click on the "Indicators" button and choose "Refresh" from that menu. Now you have the indicator in the indicators menu. Note: There is a short way for the pointsw 1 to 3. Use CTRL + J. Then you get the menu.
