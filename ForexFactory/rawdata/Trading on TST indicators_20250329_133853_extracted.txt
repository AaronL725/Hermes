Hello! I want to introduce the trading system, based on TST indicators. TST indicators - it's indicators, that you setup on H1 timeframe on pair GBPUSD, EURUSD and USDCAD. Indicators updates every morning before start of London trading session. All levels and signals are calculated based on money movements on market. Data for calculations gets from DailyBulletin of CME. Deals opening by rules of system. Closing in the same day or next day. Sometimes can happen long worked off(till 2-3 weeks) I will use indicators: 1) TST_Levels - shows important levels for today, such as Balance of the day, Borders of options channel. And shows day direction and tendency (from week wednesday to wednesday) 2) TST_Indexes - shows sentiment on market, Buy or Sell. 3) TST_Ferrums - shows strong levels of offer and demand. At least, price stops on this levels, but usually goes to rebound. And level can be not today’s level. 4) TST_Market_power - shows the most possible direction of current day. In this thread i will write how to trade using these indicators. If you don't want to download indicators yet, then you can watch the everyday levels (for TST_Levels) from indicators here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...349091&amp;page=14 All indicators is absolutely free.

And for beginning. On GBPUSD now we se flat, we update low, but correction is already close. TST_Levels shows day direction "weak BUY", so we can find good place to open order. TST_Indexes don't give signal today. On TST_Ferrums we have buy-ferrum on level 1.5796, that already gave us rebound today. And we have key level on 1.5772. So, we can set buy-limit order on 1.5772 (or on 1.5796, but not big lot). And better start open deals after news (it's after 20 minutes).

Alos on pound in friday was broken Day border of option channel. So in next few days i expecting comeback to level 1.5925. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I never heard TST indicators before. Is it pivot trading indicators ? Can you describe about TST calculation formula. Thanks ------- a to z forex indicators

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Just a heads up, in the examples of the page of the indexes, you have a mistake, the first image is the same as the last image, by the descriptions I think its the first one that is wrong.

TST system works from year 2008. Published in internet was in 2010. Now on this system works a lot of traders in Russia, Germany, Bulgaria, Ukraine and other countries. In internet exists Club of traders TST and now system becomes more and more popular. No, it's not pivot. All levels in indicators calculated using data of options and futures. So, indicators based on movements of money on market, and not on movements of price on chart.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks!! Fixed.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
TST system contains 2 parts: 1) Analisys, that include CME DB, COT, and levels where price must comeback. 2) Trade-part, tactic dependent from used indicator. Now, for example, on USDCAD we have symptom, that price must comeback to level 0,9947 in the near future.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hello! Today on USDCAD we have sell signal from TST_indexes, so we can sell with first target on 0.9965, and second target is our level where price must comeback 0.9947. Good area to sell is 1.0026 - 1.0043. On GBPUSD we have day direction to BUY, but we open day below bottom border of option channel (and this is symptom to sell). So, better wait when pound descent on 1.5786 - 1.5768 and buy there. Or buy from current, but using small lot size. EURUSD, level 1.3345 already gave rebound. But if she comeback also good levels to sell is 1.3371 and 1.3381.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Good morning! GBPUSD Today is very possible shot up from level 1.5772 (Key level on TST_Levels) or, if descends, from 1.5743 (bottom border of option channel) or 1.5758(balance of the day). Yesterday pound stops on key level 1.5768, but it don't gave us buy, so we expecting it today. EURUSD Few days in a row we have signals to sell on euro, but she don't fall. Maybe today it's time . Expecting descend today till 1.3303. If jumps up, not expecting higher that 1.3425. USDCAD Yesterday i wrote: CAD stopped in this area, today is day direction to sell, so we can keep our sell from yesterday or open sell from 1.0059(upper border of option channel on TST_Levels)

"Indicators updates every morning before start of London trading session. All levels and signals are calculated based on money movements on market. Data for calculations gets from DailyBulletin of CME." How is the update? I do not see the updated indicators.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi TST Trader, Thank you very much for sharing the indicators and the system. It looks like the levels indicator is working like a charm. But, your explanations of the indicators are not very clearly understandable. Could you please give more examples as to how to combine the main three indicators and trade your system? Please mark your entry and exit on the charts. Thanks again. Roy

--- 帖子 #13 ---
It means that levels in indicators for today draw every morning before start of London session. Indicators updates from our website. If you have some troubles, send me a screenshot and i try to help.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Roy, it's very deep theme. So i will prepare the answer with examples and descriptions in next few days.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks TST trader. Roy

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Indicators are updated automatically via the internet? How do I know that the lights are now up to date? For example. Metatrader start before NY. How do I know if indicators are updated? If not, how to update it?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
new thing for me... am interested and will sit and listen to your explanation about tst thank your for your sharing... it seems very interesting

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hello do you have any videos in english

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I answered you here . Data on server updated before start of London. Indicators check updates of data every 1 hour, and on every change of timeframe. So, if London session already started and you don't see levels for today, try to change timeframe to H4 and back to H1, indicator checks for updates and refresh the levels. Also, if you see fresh data for today on my blog , it means that indicators are already updated, and you can compare data on my screenshots with data in your terminal.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Not yet, but i plan it very very soon

--- 帖子 #21 ---
It is very small part of all what i have . In time i will give more and more information, it's impossible to give all in one post. As i wrote before, i plan to make video about indicators in English in closer time.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
thank you... will sit to watch it closely gonna study and combine it with harmonic in my table... i see something there by combining it. harmonic provides potential reversal zone... tst provides level...that's the reason why am interested. and both give potential level to re test before next move

--- 帖子 #23 ---
So, i make the video with description of main properties of TST indicators and how to use it in complex. Maybe it's not too detailed. But for better understand it will be useful. In this video i also talk about indicator TST_Global_zone. You can download it here . Description about properties and Money Management for for on this indicator you can find HERE . And, i have public account, where i trade only on this indicator and demonstrate how i open deals and where i close them. Link to trading journal, and my FxBook Don't know how to add video here . So, just link to video.... Updated at 28.01.2013, thanks to iqyu5an ! Inserted Video P.S.: Please understand, that English - not my natural language, and it's not perfect.

--- 帖子 #24 ---

--- 帖子 #29 ---

--- 帖子 #30 ---
There is many-many variants how to trade on this system. Here is classical tactic, open deals after each 120-150 pips. Or, if you also use TST_Levels or Ferrums, you can look for strong level and open deals from these levels. You also can use classical option levels for deals opening. As more comfortable for you. You also can combine TST system with system that you using now. I showing only few ways from the many.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
What we have for today... GBPUSD At friday key level at 5771 worked very good. Today we have BUY day direction. But indexes shows weak SELL, and we opened below the bottom border of option channel - it's also symptom to sell. So, we can expecting descend on key-level at 1.5737 and try to buy from it. EURUSD On euro we very close to upper overprice level (1.3513), so every next day can be last in up-trend. Be very careful with buy-deals here. Today expecting rollback from friday's growth. Possible target is 1.3370. USDCAD TST_indexes to sell. And we near upper border of option channel. Also at friday CAD touched the upper target on TST_Monthly , this levels very often give rebound. So descend is very possible today.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Do you trade USDJPY and EURJPY?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Indicators will be charged? Or update?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Nope, only EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, EURGBP. Week ago we include US Dollar index in TST Global Zone. And in the near future we plan to make S&amp;P500 in TST_Global_Zone.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
All indicators are already updated.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
In the future, will pay for it?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
No, all indicators is free. And we not plan to make it paid.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
GU buy at 562x targetting 576x as first TP ?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
hmm... why 562x?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I do not see any change.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
coz i read on that chart ... and targetting prev white line.......... prev balance ? based on tst ....... am not sure..... just asking waiting for your input and advice based on tst but based on other tools.... it make sense

--- 帖子 #42 ---
But on your chart has levels for today. You have level at 3470 - it's daily balance for today. And this level drawed from start of current day till the end of current day. Your indicator updated. Aslo you see data of update: 28 january. Everything is ok in your indicator

--- 帖子 #43 ---
O! You look on TST_Ferrums Yes, on 5623 has Buy-ferrum today. If price today go to this level it will be good for buy. But don't keep in mind daily balances(white line) of past days, if they already touched by price.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi TST TKS for very accurate info. about pairs.Though, nothing will be 100% accurate in this business but your infos are perfect

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Much better would be for example: Updated 28 January 2013 07:30 GMT.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Is no matter time. If you see today's date, it means that all is ok. Levels not changed during the day, we calculate levels at morning, and from this moment they are not changed never, it stays in history, levels are not redraw. No matter at 11 GMT or 15 GMT you will start MT, levels will be the same.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
tq buddy... still flat in gu ... just watching it at the moment

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I'm not a good detective.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Good day! What we have for today... All my thoughts about pound detailed written in comments to TST_Levels for today. Can add only one thing, we on bottom targets on TST_Monthly, so go down will be not easy w/o rebound. On Euro i still in awaiting of descend, as minimum on 3370 for beginning. But something holds her. CAD - well done! Rebound from upper target on TST_Monthly and worked yesterday's sell signal on TST_Indexes. About current situation also detailed in today's comments to TST_Levels.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
The GBPUSD agree only index level. Others levels do not agree with level Ferrum or Global Zones.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Sorry, but i not fully understand what you mean

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Data on http://tstclub.com/tst-levels-gbpusd-on29-january-2013/ disagree with my indicators Ferrum and Global Zone.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Because here only data for indicator TST_Levels. Data (levels) for TST_Global_Zone and TST_Ferrum you can see in your terminal, if setup these indicators.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Sorry. I'm confused Indicators Forex Zones and Levels.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Today 30th January 2013 04:50 GMT. Indicator TST Global Zones v3.62: "Updated 28 January 2013". Updated two days ago! Switching TF has no effect.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Jako, please be more attentive. Indicator TST_Global_Zone updates one time in a week. In description to this indicator wrote :

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hello! GBPUSD On pound we have BUY tendency, and BUY day direction. Still expecting pound as minimum on 1.5926(broken border of option channel from 18 january). I hold my buy-orders till this target. USDCAD CAD made good work. Worked off yesterday's day direction and sell signal from TST_Indexes. Today we have weak-buy on indexes, so we can expect little rollback (or falling is slows). But my expectations on 0.9964 and 0.9947. EURUSD We touch overprice level (1.3513 on TST Global Zone), and very close to yellow on TST_Monthly (1.3520). So, i very expecting rebound from here. P.S.: Today is many news, so be careful. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
TST indicators are for detectives.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Why? In description to each indicator written, when it updates. All is simple Notice: TST_Ferrum, TST_Indexes, TST_Levels - updates everyday from Monday till Friday at morning, before start of London session. TST_Global_Zone - updates every Monday at morning, before start of London session. TST_Monthly - updates every month(one time in a month), at next Monday after options expiration (usually about 4-8 day of month)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
If I came on Jan. 18, so I get to losing 250 pips. Or are there any other rules?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
If we broke border of option channel, it don't mean that you need to open buy immediately. It means that you have this level as target. But open deals with TP on this level you must only if you have good signal, and do it from strong level. So, the first order must be in area 1.5770. Why at 5770? Because only in last thursday we has complex of signals, was day direction to BUY, and price stopped on Key level. So, possible maximum drawdown in this case is about 100 pips. Second order may be on 5676 (bottom target on TST_Monthly). So, summarize. You must have 2 buy-orders. Order from 5770 you can close yesterday and today to null. Order from 5676 you can close also on 5770 and earn 94 pips of profit. It's if you not comfortable to wait 5925. If you was careful with lot size and keep your Money Management, you are in profit now and can patiently wait 5925. I doing this. Moreover, pound in buy-zone on TST_Global_Zone indicator. So, i open only buy deals in this zone, and use level 5925 as additional symptom. Be attentive! If you see signal to buy or sell, don't need open deals from current levels! Look for strong levels for open order. It can be levels from TST_Ferrum, Key level on TST_Levels, or TST_Monthly.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Also look at my few first posts in this thread, i wrote that good levels for buy on pound is 5772 and 5768, but not upper.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Buy the Indexes was already in the Wednesday. So far, this would be a loss. Indicators Monthly and Forex Zone and have not indicated on page 1.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Please, read more attentive. I wrote that only one signal not enough. Need complex of signals and strong level for open order. About orders and loss, i wrote that good level for buy is 5768 - 5772, 2 days ago was buy signal and TST_Monthly level on 5676. I said in video and wrote, that this system without stop-loss, so your maximum drawdown may be 94 pips. If you opened orders as i wrote and use the system as i wrote - you must be in profit now. P.S.: And at wednesday was no signal from indexes

--- 帖子 #65 ---
It seems i need to add Global and Monthly indicators in first post

--- 帖子 #66 ---
And, to finish our discuss about it, my deals on pound (profit in pips) : Attached Image (click to enlarge) I trade as i wrote . And in profit now

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I'll wait until you have a complete system.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
But i already have complete system. And i get profit on it a long time. Maybe it's hard to understand system that contains 5 indicators in few days. Try to watch this thread few weeks (don't trade, just watch), maybe it will be more clear for you. Maybe this system just not for you, and this is normal. Not everyone can trade w/o SL, it's psychology of each trader, somebody can, but somebody not. If you can't trade w/o SL, you can try to trade to rebound from key levels, use SL = 20 pips, TP = 50. Try on demo, maybe you'll like it. Also not everybody can trade in middle and long-term, it can be hard to sit and wait. But i, for example, have many things to do in offline, i have family, and i want to spend my time with family, and not sitting all day behind terminal and looking at price. I made analysis at morning, set limit orders and don't touch before day closing. It's comfortable for me trade in middle-term, it takes small time and small nerve from me, and it gives good and stable profit - i like it . I wanna live life, and not spend all time in terminal. P.S.: I hope you'll understand what i tried to say. And i will be glad to see you here in future.

Hello! Let's see what we have today. GBPUSD Pound continues to work on buy-signals. Today we again have BUY day direction. But part of this signal pound worked at night. So today i think that top will be in area 1.5870 - 1.5906. Also possible stop at 1.5843. USDCAD CAD continues to make good work. Yesterday's indexes gave small rollback. Today we have weak sell signal, so maybe we continue to fall. My targets still the same: 0.9947 - 0.9965. EURUSD What to say about euro? She's in hysteric now. Just be careful. I awaiting descend till the options expiration (08 february), but she can make differ . Yesterday was broken overprice level, so next possible stop at 1.3606 (upper target on TST_Monthly).

--- 帖子 #70 ---
All pairs is sleeping CAD in flat, EUR also w/o reaction. Only pound makes movements at this moment. He make stop and rebound from 1.5843. So, now i awaiting second try to go upper to 5870-5906, or falling. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Yeah, i really love Canadian dollar Look how precisely he made comeback to broken level. Good work! Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you have sell deals by my advise, better to close it here, because next target on 0,9947 can not give today. Because when we comeback to broken level, we very often make rebound.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hello! In friday was very strong movements on pound and euro, so today i don't expecting something special. Possible will be flat-buy on both pairs. On GBP you can try to buy from key level at 1.5675, but use small lots, because data is chaotic today. Euro , deep in sell-zone, but she's under political pressure, so hard to say when she stops. Very possible that in friday was local stop of growth, and on this week we can get flat-sell till expiration. USDCAD Day direction to sell. But levels are compressed, so today better don't touch him. And, important moment! Current week is week before options expiration. This week always dangerous, because in these periods often happens broke of levels and directions. So be careful on this week. Better use small size of lots in trading. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
My traditional weekly report from public account (account, where i trade on TST_Global_Zone indicator) you can read here .

--- 帖子 #74 ---
And second target on USDCAD was reached!! CAD precisely touched 0.9947. Profit in your pocket Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #75 ---
If you watch the GBPUSD, i think you notice, that in friday he broke bottom border of option channel (1.5765) and at Monday (yesterday) he came back to this level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hello everybody! This week is week before option expiration (expiration at 08 february), so i trade more carefully in this week, and my comments also will be carefully. GBPUSD We have BUY tendency, but today possible little rollback. USDCAD If you have sell deals on CAD, you can try to hold it more down. Today we have no clear signals on CAD to open new deals. He came back to all target levels, and now resting EURUSD At last stops to growth. But it is euro and week is expiration, so very carefull. In middle and long-term i hold sell-deals.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Good day! Let's see what we have today: GBPUSD Yesterday was rollback as expected. Today we have buy signal from TST_Indexes and day direction to BUY. And price now on key level 5649. Can try to buy here, or from 5606(bottom border of OC) if descends. Moreover, we on bottom TST_Monthly target. EURUSD Yesterday's growth looks like sell by better price. So today we can start to work these sells (and we also have day direction to SELL). But we can grow to 3645, so if you want to sell, then better from here. USDCAD Still weak SELL. Nothing special at this moment. P.S.: Remind you that now is week before expiration, and expectations can be broken. Be very careful!

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hello! Jolly (or dangerous? ) day expected today GBPUSD Yesterday pound can't broke Monthly level. Today we again have buy signal from TST_Indexes and buy day direction. At down we have key level at 5630 and bottom border of OC at 5629. Good place to buy . And we also have not far target at 5718 - it's broken border of OC from Tue (see on picture). So, today we have good signals, BUT, don't forget, tomorrow expiration, today many important news. So, maybe better to rest today (or use small lots). Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURUSD All depends from news today. Can say only: Good luck! USDCAD CAD is sleeping. Maybe will wake up after expiration . Anyway better don't touch him till next week.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Current situation on GBP and CAD Day started jolly as was expected GBPUSD At last buy-indexes and tendency to buy shoot! Part of profit fixed. If this sentiment will save after expiration, then pound will be grow till wednesday. And need to look on TST_Monthly at Monday. Next in line Euro. Let's see Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDCAD CAD also start to work tendency to weak sell Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good thread following it closely. Thank you for sharing your strategy.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Welcome!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hello! Today is expiration of options. So analysis can be broken. Try to not open deals today. At Monday we will have new TST_Monthly levels, new levels in TST_Global_Zone, and we will see fresh map of the market and then can make new expectations. Today good day for rest But we are traders, so, few words .... GBPUSD Day opened below the bottom border of OC, it's symptom to sell. But day direction to BUY. And expiration today. So we can expecting chaotic movements with direction to up. But be careful. EURUSD After yesterday's falling, today is possible rollback. Balance of the day is too high today, so i don't think we get him. Real area for rebound is 1.3434-1.3468. USDCAD We have sell signal from TST_Indexes and it's the only one signal for today. In the other corner of the ring we have expiration of options - who will win? P.S.: Be careful and keep Money Management today. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hello again! I think that everybody looks at levels in indicators. Today the day - when analysis and indicators can be broken. And because of this: in day like this work carefully. And today - especially. Because today will be expiration of options. On today's data i have expectations: - Pound needs to close day(or just "touch") better higher than 5750-5770 - Euro and CAD can stay and close here. - AUD - better on 1.0335 or higher.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Euro still stay. CAD little grows. AUD close to 1.0335 (already touch this level). And pound.... Pound made plan, and now even higher than 5800. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hello! Have a good weekend... and look at my fresh report from public account P.S.: Indicators TST_Monthly and TST_Global_Zone are updated, and you already can see new levels in your terminal.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hello! Expiration it's like a storm - after this we need to wait when all is calm down, and after this start to do something. And now better to wait till wednesday, then data become "normal" and analysis will be more clear. Till wednesday better administrate your old deals, look at TST_Global_Zone and TST_Monthly Have a good week!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hello! Today may be a very interesting day. GBPUSD Day opened under bottom key levels. It's good symptom to turn trend to up. But today only second day after expiration, so data can be not "clear". So, we can try to open buy (but small lot size), because day direction to buy + opened under bottom key levels + price in buy zone on TST Global Zone. Why it can be dangerous? Opened under bottom border of option channel - symptom to sell. USDCAD Can try sell small lot on TST Global Zone. Still not enough clear data after expiration, so better to not hurry up EURUSD Expecting descend today, in middle-term as minimum on 1.3285. But 90% of politics in movements of euro can decide differently. Moreover today Draghi speaks, so be careful.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Yesterday we worked both signals: we have sell work (symptom: Opened under bottom border of option channel) and then we got worked off buy signal. Today we have day direction to BUY, and indexes also to BUY. But indexes very often work on next day or after descend. So, you can try to buy from area 1.5590(key level) - 1.5561(bottom border of OC) today, or wait for tomorrow. USDCAD Yesterday's sell in work. Today we don't have new signals, so just watch for our opened deals. I will not open new deals today. EURUSD What to say, is nothing clear on Euro, hold middle-term sell-deals and watch.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Current situation on GBP at 13.02.2013 In 9 august of 2012 year was unworked pattern "ladder up". Attached Image (click to enlarge) And look where is pound made rebound: Attached Image (click to enlarge) "Ladder up" works even after 6 month! Moreover, we have here buy-zone on TST_Global_Zone, buy signal from TST_indexes, bottom border of Option Channel, bottom targets on TST_Monthly(5559, 5543). I don't need more symptoms, i buying here .

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi! GBPUSD 1) We have signal to buy from TST indexes second day in a row. 2) We have day direction to BUY. 3) We very deep in buy-zone on TST Global Zone, and very close to bottom overprice (1.5436) 4) We again opened lower than bottom key level - symptom to BUY. Summary : I will buy from 1.5485, and from 1.5440. USDCAD CAD walk slowly, but good. Work it only on TST Global Zone now. No signal intraday yet. EURUSD In middle-term - sell. Today many important news, that maybe decide tendency for euro on next few weeks. Be careful.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Yesterday price stops on 1.5485. Today on this area we have key levels. Also we day direction to BUY today. Considering that till bottom overprice left 50 pips, i will keep my buy-orders. Everyday we can reversal and start to grow. So i keep Money management and buying. Next buy will open from overprice level. USDCAD CAD sleeps whole week. I hold my sells on TST_Global_Zone to 0.9940. EURUSD Today expecting rollback for yesterdays's fall. If your deposit in normal state you can try to sell from 1.3387 - 1.3397. But i already have enough sell-deals, so i don't touch euro today.

Hello! My weekly report from public account http://tstclub.com/public-trading-si...at-17-02-2013/

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hello everybody! Comments about expectations on next 1-2 weeks read here . About today: GBPUSD What we have on pound? We have day direction to SELL, indexes to SELL, TST_market_power shows +4 (good buy signal). So if you looking place for buy, then better at levels, lower than current (indexes to sell, so can descend). Today's key levels at 5444 and 5439, and level of overprice on 5425. Why not from current? - Because i already have buy from 1.5485 (opened 14 february) and possible descend today. USDCAD On CAD we have good sell signal from TST_Market_Power (-6). So looking level for sell. Monthly level 1.0105 looks great, and we have upper border of option channel in the same area (1.0101). Or you can try from current but only if small lot. EURUSD No have clear signals on euro today. Hold middle-term sell deals. Maybe will open additional sell if jumps to 1.3480.

Hello! Today is a blind day , so we don't have levels for today. How to work? - Carefully I usually look at TST_Global_Zone and TST_Monthly in these days, and try to not open new deals. Tomorrow will be wednesday (one of the most important day in the week), we will have data in indicators and can make decisions. Good luck today!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
TST, I wanted to thank you for posting the 2 videos in particular video digest #1. It was very helpful for me to understand your trading methodology and indicators. Please keep them coming.

Hello! GBPUSD So, we have very strong signal to buy on pound, full complex: 1) indexes to BUY 2) Day direction to BUY 3) opened lower then bottom key level 4) TST_Market_Power shows +6 (strong buy signal) 5) ...and we touched overprice yesterday. So only buy deals. But keep MM, don't forget about bottom targets on TST_Monthly. USDCAD Sell signal at Day direction, indexes, and TST Market Power, i have sell from 1.0100, so earlier than 1.0150 i likely will not open new deals. But in general, level 1.0119 (upper border of OC) looks good for sell. EURUSD Hold middle-term sells. Maybe will open additional sell from 1.3470. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Yeah... And yet pound touched bottom levels on TST_Monthly. That's why need to keep money management. This is all result of "currency wars", but we work by the system and we will be in profit in the end Advise to read comments for today on my blog http://tstclub.com/tst-levels-gbpusd...february-2013/ EURUSD Today can be a little rollback. My middle-term sell-deals in work. Waiting euro on 3150-3100, where i will partially fix profit. USDCAD Again sell-signal from TST_Market_Power. And today TST_Indexes also shows SELL. Yesterday i opened additional sell from 1.0170 and we doesn't go far from this level. In middle-term will hold my sell deals till center_white on TST_Global_Zone (0.9960 on this week).

--- 帖子 #101 ---
trying my luck on buy @ 5139.. targetting 5500 - 5600 ( yes ...some resistance is detected below these level also ) wish me luck brother....

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Good luck! Great deals. And good targets. My targets little upper: first is center between overprices - 1.5906, and second - 1.6390 (upper overprice). If you look at history in TST_Global_Zone then you note, that pound always walks from one overprice to opposite (from bottom to upper and then back to bottom and so on).

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hello! GBPUSD At this moment, bottom target on TST_Monthly done his work and we have good rebound. For today we have weak buy signals: indexes not changed, day direction - flat buy, and Market_Power shows buy +2 - this is weak buy signal. I have enough buy-deals at this levels, so i don't open new deals here. When we will rise i will close "not good" deals to null or small profit. Buy-orders from area 1.5130-1.5300 i will try to hold till center of overprices and part of deals to upper overprice. USDCAD On CAD strong sell signal from TST_Market_power and day direction. So you can try to sell from area 1.0207 - 1.0216 if it rise. EURUSD I will hold sells on euro till area 1.3100. There will decide what next.

Hello! Good day with little sadness for me. I forgot to remove TP from my best deal on EURUSD (on public account), and it was closed on 1.3060. Yes, i earned 616 pips of profit, it's great but... i planned to hold this order deeper. I really don't love human factor GBPUSD I have enough opened orders, so wait for next movements. USDCAD TST indexes give us sell signal. So, if price rise to 1.0300 - 1.0330 (area of upper targets on TST_Monthly and overprice on TST_Global_Zone) i'll sell more. On current levels i have enough sell deals. EURUSD My gladness and my sorrow Today possible rollback to area 1.3113 - 1.3148. If we fall on 1.2958 (center of overprices) today, then maybe i open little buy. Why i don't open buy order from border of buy zone (1.3167 on TST Global Zone)? - Because price higher than center of overprices, and buy deals in this area not safety.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Pound still on bottom. Need to wait for movement to one of side, maybe fundament today push him. EURUSD Awaiting rollback today. Can try to sell from area 1.3152-87. USDCAD Yesterday CAD got my sell-limit order on 1.0300 and touched upper TST_Monthly target. Now expecting start of descend. But he can jump to get second target on TST_Monthly (1.0336) and start to fall after this.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hello! Today is almost no signals. The calm before the storm? GBPUSD No have clear signals, so just wait when pound start to moving. USDCAD CAD slowly descends. For today also don't have clear signals. Only TST_Market_power shows medium signal to SELL. EURUSD If rise then can try to sell from area 1.3199 - 1.3215.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hello! Flat all week, no movements, no signals - boring Maybe today we'll get some movements... GBPUSD Still wait when he start to grow. Today we have few signal but all they are weak. We have "almost buy" from indexes, and borders of option channel shifts up. If you looking place for buy deal, then you can try from 1.5156 (border of OC) and 1.5137 - 1.5118 (Key levels). USDCAD TST_Monthly level stopped rising of CAD. So now we wait when he start to fall. Today SELL signal from indexes and strong sell signal from TST_Market_power (-6). So high probability that it can start today. And about TST_Market_Power: when we see SELL signal few days in a row, but price continue to rise or in flat, it means accumulation of position to sell, after this usually happen strong fall. EURUSD Euro still can't give us good rollback. Hope on today. Ferrums are compressed, and it is usually good symptom to sharply movements.

New indicator TST Key Levels Introducing the new indicator – TST Key Levels. This is the key levels that you can see earlier in comments for GBP/USD in TST_Levels. But now this levels is more convenient in new indicator! Read more and download on this page

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi! Comments for current week read in this message . About today: GBPUSD We have buy signal from TST_indexes, +6 on TST_Market_Power and day direction to BUY. But... you see that pound broke all analysis last few weeks, it means that on market not traders, on market now BoE, and he still pushes on price down. So i recommend open only orders by TST_Global_Zone (keep step and lot size), and not trade intra day. Moreover, on current week is expiration of options, and on next week expiration of futures - and this is always stress for market and for any kind of analysis. So be very careful! EURUSD When euro will descend lower than center of overprices (1.2935), then you can start to look for middle-term buy order. But on next two weeks you need to be careful. USDCAD CAD touched second TST_Monthly upper target and touched overprice level. So i expecting him at down. Don't forget that next two weeks is expirations, so levels and analysis can be broken.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Mixed data on pound today. TST_Indexes shows weak sell, TST_Market_Power - medium buy. Day opened lower than bottom border of OC - symptom to sell. Borders of option channel is compressed, so very possible shoot. Which side? - It looks like down, and then may be again growth. Warning: We under bottom overprice level now and under bottom targets on TST_Monthly, and here is worst and dangerous place for open sell deals. So if you have enough buy deals then better be aside of market today. And remember that next 2 weeks analysis works not so good. EURUSD Still waiting rollback to area 1.3130+. And buy from indexes and +3 on TST_Market_Power can help us with this. USDCAD Canadian not hurry up He walks slowly and proudly ... I wait him on 1.0059 (center_white on TST_Global_Zone) for beginning. And today's TST_Indexes and TST_Market _Power to help us. P.S.: Remind you that current and next week not the best time for open new deals, better administrate already opened. Expirations.

Pound came back to broken at friday border of option channel. Nice! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hello! What we see today in data and indicators - it's classical chaos before expiration. And i recommend don't trade in this period, especially intraday. GBPUSD We have pattern "Clear day" on pound (it's when day opens upper than upper border of option channel). And classical work of this pattern it's sharply rise and then fall on balance of the day. Usually we work to sell on this pattern. But today balance very close to price, and we deep in buy zone, so we don't need to risk. Better strategy in situation like this is work to BUY from today's BD, and more better buy lower than BD. Key level at 1.5104 looks not bad. Also TST_Market_Power shows strong sell (-6), so descend is very possible today. But be careful, expiration is close and analysis can be broken! EURUSD Long awaiting rollback to area 1.31+ still awaiting. It can happen today. Possible scenario read here . USDCAD On CAD we work on TST_Global_Zone now, because inraday trading is dangerous before expiration. And on Global our target in area 1.0059.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hello! Expiration of options tomorrow. And to give some analisys basing on indicators that can lie in this period - will be wrong. So just read comments to pairs on my blog and better rest next 2 days. Comments: GBPUSD USDCAD EURUSD Only one recommendation: Better don't open new deals (or use very small lot size), just administrate already opened. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hello! Today is expiration of options, so no comments today. All levels in your indicators, but today all can be broken. Be careful, and better be aside from market, take a rest. At monday we will have new TST_Monthly levels and updating of TST_Global_Zone. Good luck today!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hello! Making analysis in first 2-3 days after expiration it's always useless work. Better rest, go for a walk, and read comments for current week. And recommend don't trade as minimum till wednesday.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hello! Today we also better to rest. Especially on pound. In Daily Bulletin we see that deals on current contract are closing, and opens on new contract. In this time market unpredictable. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hello! Every man have time for vacation, we have vacation in periods like this . Enjoy this time, be aside from market, because useless to try predict movements now.

Hi! It seems like we have one week vacation. Continue to resting. P.S.: Who has buy AUDUSD on TST Global Zone - congratulations with profit!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi! One day before expiration. Yesterday was good rally. Today it can continue. About situation on pound read here: http://tstclub.com/tst-levels-gbpusd-on15-march-2013/ About EURUSD here: http://tstclub.com/tst-levels-eurusd-on15-march-2013/ Good luck and be careful!

Hello! My report from public account is here: http://tstclub.com/public-trading-cu...on-16-03-2013/

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hello! Today is expiration of futures. Expecting rally. But... GBPUSD We have Clear day on pound. How to work with it? Usually we expecting rise for sell by better price with target on balance of the day (today it's 4977). But! We very deep in buy-zone and today is expiration of futures, so this signal can be broken, and if it will happen then your sell you can't close long long time. So right tactic in this situation is buy from target of Clear Day (from 4977). If your deposit feeling no good, then better do nothing today - sometimes it's most profitable position . USDCAD Patiently work on Global Zone, nothing special today. EURUSD I think you read news about Cyprus, so on euro also expecting rally. I opened small buy with target in area 1.3040. After this expecting fall, but she can rise till 1.31, so what to do next will see tomorrow. P.S.: Don't forget about expiration, and good luck!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hello! First day after expiration. Next few days better work on TST Global Zone. On Euro i hold buy to 1.3040.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hello! Now is active accumulation of positions in new futures contract, so signals is unclear. Better wait for next week to get more clear signal. And in this time better administrate your old deals by TST Global Zone.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hello! I think you saw what was on pound yesterday. That's why i don't trade this time - chaos on market. We need to rest today and, maybe, tomorrow, and wait next week to have (i hope) clear signal.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hello! Situation still unclear. Now better work on TST Global Zone, because data for intraday signals still chaotic. It's always happened after futures expiration - we have about 2 week of accumulation of positions in new contract.

We still have technical problems on our server provider. Wrote to support service, and wait normal work. On pound i don't see the bottom, i see only indirect symptom to buy, which works, but not become stronger. By time calculation important day is 1 of april, so +-2 days possible high volatility. Today we opened close to upper border of OC, and BD at down, so today is probably descend on BD and fall deeper or rebound. Anyway, i don't see strong growth, but also don't see falling. Now is hard time, hard to wait, most important is stay calm and don't panic. P.S.: I hope today server will work fine! Good luck!

On pound we have BD at down and opening close to upper border of OC, then on CAD we have reverse situation - BD at up, it give us possibility to little growth. But better follow him on TST Global Zone, he give good hedge against pound. Good luck!

Very weak data. You see, that all pairs sleeping. Moreover - Friday was holiday and we haven't data for this day. So monday - blind day! I still don't see fall on pound, but buy signal also weak (but it become a little stronger). So we don't see strong movements to one of side. And make some predictions w/o activity of traders - is useless. Levels in TST Global Zone will be the same as on past week. Because data almost don't changed.

Hello! Few words about current situation on pound and euro. In market now all working on expectations of decrease bank rate. If it will happen then we see 1.25-1.26 on euro and 1.48 on pound (if in GB also decrease rate). This is about expectations. On data i see that euro and pound can descend maximum on 100 pips down. And don't see lower. ON pound all clear, on euro "fog". If all expectations will be broken and all rates remain the same, then we have formation of bottom now - and on pound we have weak buy signal. On euro is neutral. So rise will be easy on macropositive. If in general - on positive news i see descend maximum on 100 pips and then rise. On negative - descent on 300-400 pips. Work on Global Zones and MM. And all this situation in line with timing calculation (5 april - important day). It seems like thursday and friday will be extreme. P.S.: My website at last working , so welcome, all comments to TST Levels here: http://tstclub.com/

Attention! By technical reasons, today data in indicators will be updated after 8-10 GMT. Here is data for today: GBPUSD Day borders of options balance Up 1,5423 Down 1,5163 The level of balance of the day - 1,5226 Mandatory zone 1,5278 1,5237 Zones SELL1,5443 1,5396 BUY1,5322 1,5275 Comments: Yesterday i supposed battle on yellow level. And yellow holds the price, fine! Signal to buy is worked. What for today? Again balance of the day on bottom and wide option channel. It says that volatility is still high and "flyings continues". Today is wednesday, and touch of balance today would be very interesting for next movements. But touch of balance can be only after broke of yellow - and it's to falling. So if you want to trade today - then buy-limit from BD or sell with TP on BD (but better with SL, we in buy zone). USDCAD Day borders of options balance Up 1,0220 Down 1,0129 The level of balance of the day -1,0181 Zones SELL1,0224 1,0209 BUY1,0183 1,0168 Comments: So, CAD continue to work his BD, but from side of direction - "hiding". Likely, tendency of "unclear" while raw material traders don't decide where to go. In summary i see sell on CAD. But pressure of fundament can broke this. Today is wednesday - so we can watch on work on BD with "special interest". And in general - work on TST Global Zone and stay calm. EURUSD Day borders of options balance Up 1,3611 Down 1,2827 The level of balance of the day - 1,3144 Comments: Yesterday was great rally. Sell limit from 1.32 at last in work and already in profit. What to expect today... We have sell signal from TST indexes, so we can jump to 1.3207-1.3250, but i expecting descend as minimum till BD - 1.3144.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Yesterday was pattern "Wednesday at wednesday", so now we expecting price on high of this week (I bought on BD yesterday). Today we have buy signal from indexes TST, TST Market Power also shows strong signal to buy (+6), and Day direction to BUY. I opened buy yesterday, so today i don't trade. Don't forget that possible shoot down. USDCAD CAD walks slowly, i keep my sells from area 1.0246-1.0273 (wrote here ). EURUSD Expecting continue of falling, maybe after roolback to area 1.3070-1.3100

Hello! GBPUSD I continue to hold buy from wednesday with targets on high of this week. Advise to set orders to lossless. USDCAD No have clear signals today, hold middle-term sells. EURUSD Yesterday was rollback to area 1.3070-1.3100 as expected. Today is possible rally, so be careful. If you have sell-orders from 1.32 - better to set to lossless or partially to close.

EURUSD Today is possible rollback to area 1.3037-1.3043 (if will give to sell from 1.3119 - would be great), and then descend to area 1.2959. USDCAD As usually, quiet and slowly .

Hello! Thank you for sharing the system. It seem very interesting for me. Looks like your gbpusd analysis will be very important day today.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hello! All my thoughts i wrote in comments for TST Levels today GBPUSD : comments USDCAD : comments

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hello, the volume gbpusd goes down 2 times. http://SSMaker.ru/5ff28fb1/ The fighters do the conversation. There is no “meat indicator” in the package. Thanks

--- 帖子 #176 ---
1) Yes, is no "meat indicator" in the package . I call it "meat indicator", but it is just complex of symptoms, that i sometimes see in the data. 2) Yes, the battle on this levels, because in area 1.5600 (+-50pips) will decide, we go higher or not. And, don't forget that in thursday we broke upper border of OC, and very possible rollback to area of this level (1,5354). Moreover, it is week of expiration, be carefull.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello! Expiration is soon, so be carefull on all pairs, don't risk too much. If you want to open deals, but doubt - better don't open. GBPUSD Today at last can be rollback. We still don't came back to broken border of OC from thursday, so it can be level of stop in case of rollback. USDCAD CAD is well done! In last 4 days he gave good profit. But it's time for rollback, so today or in closer days he can rise. EURUSD Chaos before bank rate tomorrow. Better don't touch. Everybody says about decreasing of bank rate, and then logically that euro will fall... but who know how it will be in real.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hello! GBPUSD If touch BD today, then will pattern Wednesday at wednesday. I set buy-limit on 1.5355. Don't forget that on 1.5353 we have broken border of OC from 25 of april. So, come back to this level is very probably. USDCAD Closing 80% of all sell-deals on center between overprices. In closer time expecting rise on 120-200 pips. EURUSD Will try to sell from area 1,3141-1,3161. Half of sell will close on 1,3040 +- 10pips. Other part maybe try to hold to 1,2935.

Hello! GBPUSD Yesterday pound rise, but on this rise was accumulation of sells. Today possible continue of accumulation (and we will rise), but, if they accumulate enough, maybe will be descend. And yesterday was weak signal to sell from TST indexes, and they often works on next day. USDCAD CAD have many debts on up, so we expecting rise. But we know that canadian is very slow, so we need just to wait. Moreover, now we don't have good signal to buy. EURUSD Yesterday euro stops in area 1,3161 as expected. Today expect descend from current, or, if jumps, from 1,3192. Be carefull.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Good fall was yesterday. Today main intrigue - yellow level (1,5409) on TST Monthly, broke or rebound. USDCAD Work on TST Global zone, maybe he starts to grow. EURUSD Possible rollback today. But still expecting in area 1,2990 - 1,2935.

hi, i read your eur/usd comments on your blog. the tendency is to sell, i would like to know base on what did you make the call to sell?? also, i watched your videos but can't understand what buttons you're referring to??thanks

--- 帖子 #208 ---
This system is authoring, and i can't to share all formulas and data sources where i get the data for calculations. Because if data sources and formulas will be shared - data source can be closed and we loose our indicators (we already have bad experince with it). Big part of calculations i give on Training courses . About "buttons" in video - i not clearly understand what you talking about.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
About today... Be carefull on all pairs today, again was delay from CME. GBPUSD We have buy signal from TST indexes 3 days in a row, and yesterday pound almost touched bottom overprice. I opened little buy. But be carefull, don't forget that we have sell tendency on options. EURUSD Was delay from CME, so hard to say something clear. USDCAD If conservatively - work on TST Global Zone (first sell from area 1.0261). If not - expecting come back to area 1.0130. Full comments read on my blog .

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Public trading. New deals. AUDUSD Yesterday was opened buy from 0.9935, lot 0.4. Today opened buy from 0.9860 (bottom overprice), lot 1.00 (1$ for 1 pips).

--- 帖子 #211 ---
hi, i'm just curious as to how you can make such good calls. i've read through this thread and compare the calls that you've made and most are very good calls. i understand your need to protect your work and source. if it means keeping the indicators accessible for all via this way. i've read the learning section on your blog and see that you charge a fee for sharing more about your tst system. which is fair. so the purpose of this thread is to promote your tst system and course?? the course fees pays for the upkeep of the servers and other expenses. does this mean the sustainability of the indicators. which is free at the moment may stop updating due to unforseeable circumstances?? maybe due to lack of funds?? what will happen to users?? your indicators are not updating correctly also. i put the tst_levels on eurusd but there are no blue zones appearing? no options channel lines also. the tst_ferrums did not appear on monday and today?? i went and listened to your video again. it's not button but patterns, sounds like button to me at first. thanks

--- 帖子 #212 ---
If you personally can make serious money trading FX, why bother showing others how to trade and charging them a fee of $450? I'm just curious.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
As you know all indicators is free. And you can use as you want, and this is enough for profitable trading. But, if you want to know more, want to know how to calculate day direction, how to calculate important levels and so on, you can pass the training course. Fees from courses it's like a bonus for us, for our time. We support indicators and without students, stable update of indicators is not dependent from count of students! We update indicators for our use also. We trade on the same indicators as and you And indicators updated correctly. About TST_Levels on Euro. In description to indicator TST Levels at the bottom of page written: And options channel lines exists on euro - it just very wide. Levels in TST_Ferrum already appears in indicator. Our apologize

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Have two categories of people: First wants to share something good with others. Second - don't want. We are from first category. Why courses isn't free? I spend my time for it, and i appreciate my time, i have a family. Because full lenght of course is about 7-9 hours. And this is also protection from 'accidental' peoples. I ready to spend my time for peoples - who really interested in serious trading on forex, but not for they who don't know what he want. Anybody can try to trade on indicators for free. And if this system good for you can continue to trade further, and not pay for it. But if you really want to know how calculate levels and directions by yourself, want to understand how we calculate sentiment, how to calculate levels where price must come back - you can pass the course. And in this message i want to stop discussion about price of courses and something like this. In this thread i writing about trading on TST indicators. It's not for commercial purposes. So, if you want to know more about training - feel free to write in my Skype or Email (all this information you can find on my blog).

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi all, I want to share my cm below which just my thinking about this thread - First: I want to sent big tks to TST who shared this indicator &amp; instructed, updated tactic for us about tendencies/direction/sentiment... of pairs EU/GU/UC … daily/w/m without profit. I think newbie can develop tactic themselves with this basic information. I really appreciated that. - Second: We want to become professional traders. We must individual equip our knowledge about trading by study courses w many difference fee, it’s personally to option which isn’t TST’s courses. That’s true, i think so. - Last: all member concern about accuracy, updating of indicator is truism. We will receive the cm, tactic updating usually, we hope that. @ TST: I have a suggestion , which important w me but this can cause busy for you. When you open order or change tactic of pairs EU/GU/UC … in daily (if any), you can write cm in this thread or show me where i can look for your public trading on real time. Instead of update trading public weekly on your blog only. U can ignore this suggestion if you don’t feel free. Tks again TST. p/s: apologize for me with E not good

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hello! I think today will be very interesting day GBPUSD We have anomal strong buy signal on pound, we have three signal to buy from TST indexes from past days, Yesterday we made pattern "wednesday at wednesday" (expecting rise to the high of the week). All these symptoms says about buy. BUT! Don't forget that on this moment middle-term tendency to sell and BoE still in market, so be very carefull. P.S.: I bought But not big lot size! EURUSD Looks like preparing good growth, but all is not clear, so advise to not trade today on euro. USDCAD w/o some changes. Trade on Global Zone.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
TST How about AUDUSD in today? Could you give some suggestion?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
thanks for the info tst. just keep on sharing.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Sorry for delay with answer, was busy. Don't concern about updating. Our team work as a good watch . If we have some technical problem with updating of indicators - you always can look levels for a day on my blog and continue to trade w/o inconvinience. My public trading in real time you always can look at MyFxBook , all deals are opened for viewing. And, when i can, i will write about my new deals on this account in this thread (like this ). I can't promise that i will public all deals in real time here, because i don't sitting behind terminal whole day. That's why i usually use limit-orders. Also i every morning write about my tactic for a day in comments for indicator TST_Levels on my blog . And often write here my thought, but little bit shorter (compressed) than in comments.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
AUDUSD yesterday touched bottom overprice on TST Global Zone. So i opened buy with working size of lot. Expectations? now first target for me is center between overprices (now it's on 1,0349). When Australian will grow - i will close "worst" deals to null profit, and hold good deals to maximum profit. (For example: today i closed part of sell on NZDUSD from upper overprice, my profit 493 pips, last part of this order i will try to hold deeper) Can AUD descend more? Yes, it's possible, but probability is not high, and if you look in history of indicator TST Global Zone, then you will see that in may of year 2012 price descend lower than bottom overprice on 140 pips - for middle-term and our money management it's not critical. Also i see in data, that accumulation of long-deals started, how long it will be i can't say. P.S.: Don't forget what time on market now - it's currency wars. And i almost everyday write that need to be carefull. P.P.S.: And always when you don't know how to interprete position of price in indicator(in any indicator) - switch indicator to history mode and look how price moves in similar situation.

Hello! Today we don't have good signals for trading, so only few words: USDCAD Today descent can continue. Because we have sell signal from indexes TST, he in Sell-zone by TST Global Zones, and he two day can't broke upper target on TST Monthly (1.0294) and rebound from it. Level of balance of the day on 1.0232 can stop his falling, or area 1.0207-1.0183. EURUSD As and usually in last days, we have different signals from indicators. TST indexes shows buy signal, but TST Market Power gave us strong sell (-6). So, maybe we will go both sides today. GBPUSD No signals for today.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hello! looks like today will be hot day Be carefull. GBPUSD All data says about buy. But look in news calendar - be carefull today. Possible scenarios: 1) Descent to area 1.51-1.5065 and then rise to 1.52+ 2) Flat and rise. USDCAD Yesterday again was try to broke upper target on TST Monthly, and again it fails. In middle-term i expect descent. For today no clear signals. EURUSD Expecting descent to area 1.2890-1.2903 and then rise to area 1.30+.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Public trading. New deals. USDCAD Opened sell from 1.0384 (lot 1.0) - upper overprice level

GBPUSD: i argree, It's look like chaos, even AUDUSD too. I feel have very much sell sentiment in mid-term on market against buy signal of these. i'll close long GBPUSD if it fall deeper .4950. Do u think so?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I will not close buy orders if pound go deeper. But! I also will not open new buy deals while i don't have good signal or change of tendency. And i also will not sell, because we on bottom target on TST Monthly and on bottom overprice on TST Global Zone. I working with money management, so descent deeper 4950 is not scare for me. And, by data i don't see pound lower than 1.49 at this moment, maybe tomorrow it will changes, but today it is so. P.S.: This is all about middle-term.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
tks TST, i also keep MM, i want close part of long only, and wait next buy signal. Now look like normal, maybe tomorrow it will changes. I also hope so.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hello! GBPUSD At this moment most important - broke 1.5000 or not. Now is too late to sell, and we haven't signal to buy - need change of middle-term tendency or signal from Heiken. EURUSD Today is possible descent on 1.2830 and then rebound or fall deeper. But better don't trade on euro today USDCAD CAD touched upper overprice level. I sold. But, if situation on your deposit is dangerous - better wait signal from Heiken Ashi. More detailed comments for today read here .

GBPUSD. Battle in 5245 Who watch on pound - see his rush to area 5245. AT this moment situation on picture: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So, who set buy-stop on 5245 - in market. If you set middle-term deals - follow by TST Global Zone. If you using intraday big lots - look place for SL. Because for confirmation tendency to buy we need to hold higher 5245. Let's look on closing of day today and on data in DB tomorrow. It may be a fake before expiration of futures. But on current moment all says about cancelling of sell tendency.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Today is possible rollback, if you trade short-term - better fix part of buy-orders. P.S.: Tendency changed to buy. Detailed comment for today read here USDCAD Nothing interesting. Work by TST Global. EURUSD Today is possible roller coaster. I set buy-limit on 1.2988 and sell-limit on 1.3145. TP for buy on 1.3145 and TP for sell on 1.2990+-

Hello! GBPUSD Today we have indexes TST to buy and wednesday at wednesday. But on data i see rollback down. So, very probably that today will be descent, and tomorrow we wll rise. Full comment here . USDCAD On canadian no clear siganls. So, relax and wait EURUSD Today expecting few scenarios. 1. Descent on 1.3053-1.3061, and then rise to 1.3115-1.3140 and fall in area 1.3020. 2. Rise to area 1.3107-1.3115, then descent on 1.3053-1.3061 and again rise to 1.3140 and slowly descent in 1.2980. 3. Rise to 1.314 , and then fall in 1.2980. I like more third scenario.

Hello! Report from my public account .

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Comments for trade week 17-21 of june 2013 Today the day, when i an give recommendation without indicators - take a rest. Yes, again. Why? It's simple. Today expiration of futures. In tuesday wednesday will be Fed's meetings. And in wednesday Bernanke say something about QE. So, i think you understand why better look at this from other side, or rest on the beach till wednesday . Pound still in middle-term buy tendency. And area where will be "decide" where to go next is 1.55-1.56. At this moment i don't see symptoms of sell. New futures contract accumulate very weak, don't see sentiment of players. I don't like to discuss about fundament. But in last time many questions about this. So.. i don't specialist in fundament, but i have some thoughts. And i think that Bernanke don't want to finish QE while he is a head of Fed. But and continue also became harder. And considering that till his retirement left very small time, we can hear nothing clear in wednesday. Likely we don't hear some decision about QE. On second place in my top - that QE will continue till new year. And the smallest probability - that QE will finished. Where will go market in these cases? I think nobody knows. Even themselves - this is the top of global manipulation machine So, till wednesday i will only watch. Pound in good profit, canadian also. NZD 240 pips. Only Australian in drawdown, but also starts to grow. Will wait - maybe will come to our target 0.9800 - 1.0000. My recommendation, wait till wednesday and don't risk.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hello! Recommend to not trade today. Market in awaiting of Bernanke's speech, and analisys can work not good. GBPUSD Pound stops on upper targets on TST Monthly. And we still waiting rollback down. So, maybe it will be today, also we have signal to sell from indexes (Pound already descend a little). USDCAD Today expiration of futures on CAD. Don't touch him. EURUSD Possible descent in area 1.3274 - 1.3307, and there rebound or go deeper.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hello! At last. Today will be Bernanke's speech. I will be aside today, and recommend it to you. We need to see reaction of market (i think you know that reaction is not always logical ), and look on data in DailyBulletin after this to make decision. Be carefull and good luck!

Hello! On Canadian and Euro recommend to rest today. About situation on GBPUSD. First - congratulations with profit who trade only on TST Monthly. You third month in a row with profit Attached Image (click to enlarge) I sold with you in april, bought in may. But here don't opened sell. Hope to buy with you from "Ladder up" and yellow. And my "wish" by yellow scenario in work. And when we finished the yellow scenario i want to start blue. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Main now is accelerate tendency. Buy tendency is broken - it's a fact. Changing to sell tendency - it's also fact. But need to confirm this. Closing today and tomorrow lower 5448 will be confirmation of sell tendency. But always exists variants. Pound stopped on shortstops area. And if we broke this now, then next terget is Ladder up. If we don't broke shortstops zone - will rise again - then will hard to pass area 5564 - 5674. There possible new attack of bears. From side of Global, pound out of sell zone and fall under center of overprices. This is the place where we can look for buy and be carefull with sell. But now we work in tendency, and tendency now is flat-sell. So, tactically i would work by next scenarios. 1. Do nothing. Let him fall on Ladder up. There buy very SMALL lot(because it will be against tendency) and then again wait. I will do like that. If we go lower - then wait for change of tendency and go as minimum to come back to yellow (because if we will fall it means that yellow will be broken), and as maximum - to upper overprice. 2. More agressively: Sell from area 5674-5564(better higher than 5605). And desirable to set SL higher 5765. Because in this area probably battle between bulls and bears. And if bulls will win - then go to upper overprice. 3. Very agressively. Sell-limit in area 5480-5550(only with SL) and trying to fall in 1.50. And important levels for today: 5356 5538 By the way, pound stopped in area unworked levels 5450 and 5428. Maybe buy signal from indexes will give rebound from this area and we go up.

Hello! GBPUSD On pound we need confirmation of change tendency to sell. So better be carefull. USDCAD Canadian got all old unworked balances and came into upper quarter on TST Global. We can start to sell it a little. EURUSD Today very possible descent from area 1.3232 - 1.3250. If don't broke this signal, then we can touch 1.3106 - 1.3050. Be carefull.

Hello! My traditional report from public account P.S.: Perfect work of scenario on euro yesterday and good profit!

--- 帖子 #271 ---
One more "wish" is worked Attached Image (click to enlarge) It worked, precisely by yellow scenario. Now need to work blue scenario, but i have doubt about this, because tendency to sell, that we noticed in time - can broke this expectation. Anyway, even if "Ladder up" will be broken - let it be. And comeback here is garanteed, because if to broke "Ladder up", then we need to broke Yellow levels also. And this - always gave comeback. By the way, first yellow we already touched yesterday. Who work on TST Monthly i think happy now, all precisely and clear. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And write here results of work by tendency, because buy tendency is finished... Red line – “moment” of define tendency. Blue line – potential of profit. Yellow – “distance” in pips from one identify of tendency to next. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buy from 31 of may till 20 june was defined very precisely. Distance from tendency to tendency 255 pips. Potential profit 535 pips. Tactical recommendations also worked fine. By the way, who work by sell recommendations from 20 june - also congratulation: in any tactic - all in plus now. ( link to message from 20 of june ). If too lazy to read everything - here is an excerpt from a post: From side of Global, pound out of sell zone and fall under center of overprices. This is the place where we can look for buy and be carefull with sell. But now we work in tendency, and tendency now is flat-sell. So, tactically i would work by next scenarios. 1. Do nothing. Let him fall on Ladder up. There buy very SMALL lot(because it will be against tendency) and then again wait. I will do like that. If we go lower – then wait for change of tendency and go as minimum to come back to yellow (because if we will fall it means that yellow will be broken), and as maximum – to upper overprice. 2. More agressively: Sell from area 5674-5564(better higher than 5605). And desirable to set SL higher 5765. Because in this area probably battle between bulls and bears. And if bulls will win – then go to upper overprice. 3. Very agressively. Sell-limit in area 5480-5550(only with SL) and trying to fall in 1.50. So, will see how long will this sell tendency - on the way two yellow and "ladder up". Have a good week-end

Hello! Few words about new trade week you can read here .

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Pound on crossroads now. He can come back to retest yellow level, or can start to grow and broke sell tendency. So, better wait change of tendency to buy, or try to buy a little from "Ladder up" if come there. EURUSD Still possible descent to area 1.3000, but area 1.3106 - 1.3086 can hold the price. USDCAD CAD gone very high. Broke upper targets on TST Monthly, and leave many unworked balances at down. Today sell signal from indexes TST, and we opened close to upper border of OC, so can be rollback.

Attention! I gonna on vacation for one week. So, from tomorrow (Friday, 05.07.2013) till 13 july i don't write comments. P.S.: All indicators will work and update in normal mode, every day!!!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi everyone! On last week was many events and very high volatility, but at this moment we almost on the same levels as and on 4 july, where i gone on vacation About this week. After rush up on past week market stopped to decide what next. I thought - what are we waiting for? And BINGO! Market wait wednesday and thursday - Bernanke's speech. All very tangled in his speeches and on market. And we have to work with this. Work on Global + Heiken on D1. On pound we identified symptoms of changing tendency to buy, but it not confirmed yet. It will be confirmed when we broke and retest high of 11 july. It's levels 5220. Comeback to low - broke 4811 and hold lower. Very wide range for define tendency. But here also possible to work. Variants: 1. Buy-stop 5220 + 10-25 pips (You can set SL, but i don't know where) 2. Buy-limit from area 1.4962 (Ladder up from 11 july). If you will use big lot - then necessarily to set SL! To open orders from current levels - not good. Open sell? Not good idea too. So wait Have a good week!

Hello! Today very possible delay of updating data in indicators. So watch all levels on my blog .

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hello! Be carefull today on all pairs, possible sharply movements on Bernanke's speech. Comments: GBPUSD USDCAD EURUSD

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello! It feels like we gonna come back to levels that was before positive expectations of Bernanke's speech. Pound can't hold higher than 5220 - it was condition to confirm tendency to buy. And almost did wednesday at wednesday, but ALMOST. Canadian and euro - the same. Don't go somewhere, but wants, i see this. Bernanke is crafty, he says unclear, for "his" peoples understand what he wants to say, and others will be in a fog and don't panic. It was first day. Today is the second. Will see how it be. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hello! Second day of Bernanke's speech gave very weak reaction. On data i see chaos and fear to fall. Who will win? Maybe we'll see it tomorrow. Why? Because big players don't leave a marks, maybe because is summer now. On all pairs we have similar situation, very possible correction, on pound and euro to down, on Canadian to up. GBPUSD EURUSD USDCAD

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Yesterday's signal to sell worked very weak. Today balance again at down and signal to buy from TST indexes. All this can give ideal scenario: descent on today's balance and rebound (maybe continue of growth after this). Not ideal - rise from current, or broke balance and fall deeper, then will watch where he going. Maybe - on Ladder up on 1.49. For me - need to go somewhere, no matter which side. Because read "summery" bulletins it's mockery, i'm joking of course USDCAD Canadian slowly descends with upper balances. This is - upper debts on Global. I keep profitable sell, and in case of jump to upper balances - will add to sell. If we fall deeper - work by Global (partially close on center and so on). EURUSD Very hard to define scenario today. Too chaotic data today.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hello! GBPUSD We can get comments from yesterday, and they will ok for today. Today again signal to buy from TST Indexes, and scenario the same as yesterday. USDCAD Canadian continues to gladdens, sells by TST Global in good profit. And he can descend lower. But balances is still at up. And this says about probably rise of Canadian, and it can give us chance to add to sell by TST Global. Who risked to buy here - good luck! EURUSD Again very unclear scenario. All mixed. I can say only one thing, they very want to 1.3330, but can't yet. And if we'll come there, then will look for middle-term u-turn to 1.2740

Public trading. New deals. EURUSD Opened sell from border of sell-zone at 1.3280 (lot 0,5). Moreover, upper quarter not far.

Hello! Report from public account for last week is here: http://tstclub.com/public-trading-cu...on-27-07-2013/

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Comments for trade week 29.07 – 02.08 of year 2013 Current week is most uncomfortable for forecasts and expectations. Moreover, on this week many important news (bank rates) - so i think till this moment we can not expect some good movements. Even if will be - don't care. System in profit, and if pairs that in profit will descend - we will average. If will go further in profit, then will close by TST Global. About details... Everybody saw TST Monthly and note this work. Likely, you note work of Canadian on TST Monthly. And good work of tendency to buy on GBPUSD, but it freezes and, maybe, awaiting push from bank rate. Anyway, i expecting "decision" about broke or continue of tendency in range between two peaks on 25 july: bottom on 5265 and top on 5435. Here will decide what tendency we will have, buy or sell. In general, wait movements on news on this week, and then will see.

Hi What does the magenta and blue lines mean in H1 EURUSD chart with TST Levels indicator?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
This kind of levels was added in version 3.52 of TST_Levels indicator, and they shows additional symptom of tendency for a day, if blue level lower than red then tendency is BUY, if red lower than blue – SELL. Also, if you look at history, you will see that these levels very often stops the price and gave rebound.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi, Thanks for the reply. How about the dash lines in the TST levels. Those are also potential areas of rebound right?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
1.3342 TST Sell Level 6 confluence with daily pivot resistance and weekly pivot resistance. This area will be interesting if price reaches there.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Exactly!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Yes, area 1.3330 - 1.3342 very strong today on Euro. On 1.3330 - red level, 1.3336 - upper quarter on TST Global.

Nice trades yesterday on balance of day line in EU.

Hello! Sorry for delay today.... GBPUSD EURUSD USDCAD

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi TST, 1st trade today sold at 3277. TP at 3272. Today i have to change to server 2 for the lines to be updated. Is that normal?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Yes, sometimes happens troubles with servers and you need to change it, that's why we need three servers But now all bugs fixed, and all servers have data.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Does any of the lines have to do with Options? Currently i am using TST Levels only.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Yes, all levels calculated based on data from DailyBulletin from CME. If you trade intraday, indicators TST_Ferrum (for EURUSD and GBPUSD) and TST_Key_levels (GBPUSD only) can be usefull

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Can you roughly tell me the difference between TST Ferrum and TST Levels? I am a daytrader and scalper. I trade mostly using floor pivots. With this we can determine stronger levels to trade. For example, yesterday white line in EURUSD is also the weekly pivot line.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
If short, TST Levels shows range of movements for current day (borders of OC) and balance of the price (price, that good for both side, bears and bulls). TST_Ferrums shows strong levels for buy or sell deal.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hello! GBPUSD So, Ladder up was broken at night, with retest. About change of middle-term tendency nothing to say, because pound in center of tendency direction calculations. Broke of low from 25 july and broke of "Ladder up" gave us reason to fix part of buy deals, that was opened by tendency (not on TST Global). Today's balance give us a mark that probably will be "original" scenario, and not as always - when fall with upper balances and rise with bottom. Of course "Wednesday at wednesday" looks very cool, but need to descend on 118 pips for this. It's not a problrm for him. And is he do this, then will be ideal scenario for today: we have buy from TST indexes, and touch of balance today will give us reason to expect come back to high of the week and not say about change tenency to sell. Will see how it be in real. EURUSD Expecting descent from current or from 1.3330-1.3350. USDCAD Canadian stable give us balances at up. And we know that it is good symptom to work, and looks like he start to do this. Hard to say will get all upper balances or not, but today's high balance gave us reason to expect rise.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi Is it possible to view TST levels of previous days?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Of course. You can set parameter "ShowAllHistory" to true in indicator settings, and you will see all existing history

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi I have set to true but cant see the green and blue dash lines for yesterday. Please advise

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Heh... To see these levels need to set to "true" parameter "ShowOldTST_Levels".

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Perfect. Got it. The levels are given by your server. Do you teach how to calculate the TST levels using CME data?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Nope, i don't teach how to calculate levels in TST_Levels indicator. I teach more important things: day direction, weekly sentiment and scenario, levels where price must come back and etc. (more detailed about training read here ). Because most important to understand where price "wants" to go. Finding strong level not so big problem (moreover, we teach how to calculate important option levels, that can be used to set order). Basically, TST system is for middle-term trading. But now we developing intraday system with SL.

Hello! Read comments on my blog: GBPUSD EURUSD Day scenario: not defined USDCAD

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Read comments on blog... EURUSD Day scenario: not defined. Scenario of fall from 3330 in work, now we need to find point of exit. USDCAD What to say - Canadian working expectations of getting upper balances. Who bought - with profit! Who trade only on TST_Global - look place for sell.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hello! Read comments on my blog today... GBPUSD EURUSD USDCAD

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hello GBPUSD Read on blog EURUSD Day scenario: not defined USDCAD I tactically work expectation of sell a little higher. Will be “sad” if will fall from current, i want to add to my sell.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hello! GBPUSD Not good to "see" change of tendency before two days till expiration. We broke high from 02.08 and hold higher. I don't see reason for rise now, and for fall only weak signal to sell from indexes TST. So, i will don't sell, if buy - then from area 5213. P.S.: If we'll get "wednesday at wednesday" today - will be funny USDCAD After yesterday's unworked balance, today we see balance at up, it's close but at up. 2 days till expiration, so i recommend don't do deal with big lots. After expiration will see on situation. EURUSD Day scenario: not defined Expiration of options after few days, so better wait new level in TST_Monthly. I will wait, and wish to you. Possible fall from 1.3322

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hello! Today can be very interesting day, expiration tomorrow, so be very carefull. Good luck! GBPUSD Nothing surprising in today's signals. After such rise as yesterday - it's normal. Expiration tomorrow. Would be great to broke this signal But keep in mind, that if this descent is will, it can broke everything. Who don't buy yesterday - today is too late, don't do this. Wait rollback or, better, wait monday. Because if today's signal will worked, it will be great show. Who sell with hope of rollback - good luck, it can worked. We arrive to center of TST_Global, and maybe will make rollback before rise to upper overprice. USDCAD Let him rise to 1.0518. There will sell by TST_Global. If not - then will see new levels in TST_Monthly in monday and decide what to do. EURUSD Today likely a little growth and then fall. Expecting as minimum 1.3219-1.3244.

Hi guys, sorry for the late reply, was away for a while and back to updates now As per trading on current market we don't make much of difference, following Global zones. The only difference right now is that we use last month Global balances due to american gov shutdown and delays in COT reports. Because of that we just try to be more careful and conservative.
