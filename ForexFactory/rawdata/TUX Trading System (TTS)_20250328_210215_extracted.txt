U se this trading system at your own risk . I accept no liability for system damage, financial losses, and even loss of life . At first try this trading system on a demo account for a while and make sure that it works for you. Suggestion of new indicator addition or changes in the system without prior coordination is not accepted in this thread. Hello guys, I hope you are all well. i was developing my own system based on "Payapa System" since about three months ago when i got familiar with this strategy from this thread and dear alhalawi . i improved the original payapa system with many changes and new look and feel. i was testing this system in a telegram channel meanwhile with great and promising results. i was on final testing phase and i had plan to share it here in near future when i passed all the tests that all users can benefit from this system. but suddenly i was confronted yesterday with a bad news. the bad news was stealing of my system and sharing that on some websites and telegram channel and also selling it !! these are the websites that stolen my works: https://****.com/mt4/indicators-mt4/payapa-tux-edition-v2-v2.01-v3/ https://****.com/shop/payapa-tux/?fbclid=IwAR1H35gI2dO3cdZ3sSUUX89yUhQSaPJHM02M_2uyXMlbHRGIQk7tExhfm-0 https://****.com/shop/payapa-tux-edition-v2-v2-01-and-v3/ https://www.forexstrategiesresources...-strategy-mt4/ All I can do now is inform this subject and share this system for free here. i included all indicators and pdf guidance file in the attached package. I will update this post later for further and supplementary information when i have free time. Feel free to use it and share your opinion. SOME POINTS: About repainting arrow please pay attention that it's not the main and vital part of this system. It's just one more confirmation and builds more confidence before opening of a position. so please don't be too sensitive to this issue. you can remove it if you're not comfortable with that. OBV (On Balance Volume) indicator. because of the de-centralized Forex market and different measurements of volume in each broker, the result of OBV can be different from broker to broker. so keep in mind if you see different OBV line on other trader's chart. If you don't see the red line (DzTDI) in RSI window, you need to copy dynamicZone.dll (included in zip file) to \MQL4\Libraries folder. step by step solution to prepare the chart for TTS ( # post 583 ) Regards Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) TUX_Trading_System.zip 1.9 MB | 8,885 downloads

Dear sir, Thank you for sharing your system. I have a question, does the arrow of the beast signal repaint after candle close? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Yes it can repaints but not all the time. there is no problem about this issue. please read the pdf file that i explained about this subject and why there is no problem about this worry.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
are you trading real account or demo

--- 帖子 #7 ---
At first i was on demo account for about 1 month but for now i'm on a small real account for less than 2 months on this system. but still, because I was developing and testing this system, sometimes i used the demo account during these two months. but for now i'm mostly on real account.

this shows that you didn't understand the system completely! you didn't even bother yourself to read the pdf file (that i explained about this subject) at least once before commenting here. good luck with your searching for a non-repainting system !!

Attached Image (click to enlarge) You see an example of short-term (scalping) trade that i took last week: 1) upwards crossover happened in middle zone of RSI so we look for buy trade opportunity. 2) the green arrow appeared and also candle closed above EMA21, so we can open a buy position here. About repainting arrow please pay attention that it's not the main and vital part of this system. It's just one more confirmation and builds more confidence before opening of a position. so please don't be too sensitive to this issue. you can remove it if you're not comfortable with that. 3) i will look for nearest line on chart as TP level, but in this case we don't have those desired levels. so we have some options for closing the position: OBV line enter strong resistance zone of RSI window (dark pink area) or touch it (3) price reach the nearest peak on chart (4) the candle close bellow EMA21 and if the order was on profit we can close it. we always have hope that price moves to our favor direction so if the order wasn't on profit we don't close it and we will wait for other exit conditions to occur. in this case the exit conditions of 3 and 4 happened at the same time approximately and i closed the position in the last minute of the market because i usually don't keep orders open after market close (especially scalping trades). If the market did not close, i was moving SL level more to near of current TP level to have a chance to make more profit.

Thank you tuxTrader - i am very interested in your system and I will follow with interest. Your work is really appreciated.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thank you. Interesting system. Subs!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hello, looks great, will gladly continue to pursue it

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Excellent system Tux,keep doing your great work and any trolls decide to interfere with your system or alter it beyond your results achievable,just get rid if them,your contribution greatly appreciated.Order Blocks,support and resistance as you have draw here,is another key in this method TPs/Entry/Exit/.Subscribed and very contented simplicity

--- 帖子 #21 ---
TUX hi. i love this way of trading. "simplicity". Not difficult to follow. Is this system an improvement on "How Wags trade"? Very much the same principles. Thanks, i am subscribed.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I really did not expect so much welcome for this system. I really appreciate all of you and i hope we can succeed together... Hi, No, this system is not improvement of Wags system. i didn't check that system in details. maybe because of using OBV you think there is some similarity in concept. i don't know ... but definitely Wags System is a great system because of using the OBV indicator that i think this indicator is the key to success... as you see in scalping method of my system, it gives very accurate and predictor crossover with DzTDI... and i should remind that this system is improvement of original payapa system which i became acquainted with that here .

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Tux, great system, interested in giving it a go. Thanx!! Can anyone help me? I've loaded the system onto my platform, all indicators work well except for the TzDTI red line in the indicator window. The indicator list on the chart shows its there but I cant see the line.....anyone know why? Much appreciated if you can help me

--- 帖子 #27 ---
there is a note about OBV (On Balance Volume) indicator. because of the de-centralized Forex market and different measurements of volume in each broker, the result of OBV can be different from broker to broker. so keep in mind if you see different OBV line on other trader's chart.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks again Tux, that worked

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks for your efforts and elaborate pdf. In this statement, from page 2, I believe it means that backtesting, using the 'Cloud', may not be accurate. " When you see displacement of EMAs lines (Cloud) and other lines in RSI oscillator (for example at a specific time it was on resistance zone but after a few hours you see that in middle zone), it's not called repainting! but it means that price broke the support/resistance zone or in other words support/resistance zone didn't hold price. " Am I correct in assuming this? Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Yes, you're right! for testing of this system you mostly need forward-testing which i think is worth it.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Attached Image Hello TuxTrader, When I applied the above setting on GBPNZD only then did I get that much wanted cross on this instrument.However, CLOSE setting does not give me that,instead possibly a retest into the blue zone,just a bit closer.Thanks.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
your chart's zoom is incorrect! before any analyzing and trading you need to correct your chart's zoom. please read the pdf file ...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Here you go..max zoom in zoom out 3 times tuxTrader, just to make sure ..we are waiting for OBV and dzTDI crossover and if it happens in the grey zone we are in on that Sell? I may not take it as it was a decent move down already, but per rules, we are ok to go in as we still have space to go 'till pink line resistance?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Entry, please critic..

--- 帖子 #47 ---
it's normal that you miss some trades on some pairs. This is the situation for me too, i also miss some trades opportunity sometimes that my friends take those because of different broker's data. based on my tests the only setting that works is "Close". but if you want to make sure for best setting, you need at least some weeks of forward-testing the different settings on all pairs! if you did this job, please share the results here. thank you

--- 帖子 #48 ---
after the crossover you should see if there is enough space for price too move and it shouldn't be too close to target level. but there is an important point here: sometimes after the crossover we see that price is in peak (for buy) or in valley (for sell). in this conditions we have to be very careful and in most cases we should skip these trades .... because this type of crossover is sign of changing in trend direction ...

--- 帖子 #49 ---
your entry is a bit late. you should enter on first candle that closed above ema21 because you don't know that the next candle is bullish or bearish to wait for retrace of price. By observing money management and proper lot size, you can also have multiple entry to catch the best entry level.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Beautiful explanation Tux,thank you very much,i'll use CLOSE setting and monitor all pairs accordingly,forward-testing rocks! I will share during this week,my problem is always being awake on time,since London open here in my timezone is 3am :-),thanks brother,all the best,more than 100% support. Stay Safe.

Thanks for that. I put it at 0.9357. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see in the marked areas we have some upwards crossover but the entries on chart are too close to resistance zone and we don't know if price can break that or not! there is many opportunities in the market and there is no problem that we miss this position if price breaks resistance zone.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
EURAUD, ~+132 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is an example of Long-Term trading which is closed some minutes ago. The rules is as follows: 1) in RSI, cloud &amp; OBV are in resistance zone and dzTDI is also near resistance zone. It's perfect setup if dzTDI will be also in resistance zone but it's important that it at least will be near resistance zone. sometimes you see that dzTDI is on other side. 2) price is inside resistance zone. 3) at time of entry, atr/CL was gray and tti/D1 was gray or weak sell. * red arrow and close of candle below ema21 as final confirmations. 4) when price was near of TP3, i moved both SL &amp; TP and position closed at support level as you see. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #58 ---
AUDCHF, ~+41 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you see, the entry candle that marked with red arrow is close to bottom of resistance zone and if you enter on this candle you should close order at the next candle. but if you look, there is enough space inside resistance zone for moving of price, so you can wait for price to break the bottom line of resistance zone and then enter the trade. the target is also at top line of resistance zone.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Same trade, but I did not close when price hit first the first resistance line due to end of retracement (based on my own analysis) and closed today at second line. Regards, Blackeagle

Hello, I have uploaded the system to my platform and copied dynamicZone.dll to libralies but all indicators are working fine except for the red TzDTI line in the indicator window ( .

--- 帖子 #63 ---
This system has no new magic. But it is helping traders not to brake rules and stay focus. Well done..!!!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
What about this trade?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Good job

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I don't predict that it moves or not, maybe it goes in your favor direction, but based on rules there is no sell setup on both long-term and short-term methods, for these reasons: - the price broke up resistance zone and it is possible that it turns into support zone. - both tti and atr/CL shows up trend. - the entry is too close to top of resistance zone and there is not obvious enough space for price to move. - the OBV line was mostly below DzTDI line recently and this type of downward crossover is wrong. so it's better to skip this trade ...

Cheers Tux !!!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
many people are using this system without any problem. definitely you're doing something wrong... sorry, i don't know what's the problem in your side and i can't help you.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi Tux I have been running some tests on the 30 min TF and looks very promising, I catch a few extra pips on 30 min as on the 1 hr TF. I have a example of a trade on the 30 min, arrow signal, price crossed and closed above the 21 ema but TDI and OBV did not cross. They did cross a couple of hours before. Price closed above TMA and weekly high, not to put you on the spot but would it have been a valid trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I'm not interested on lower timeframes in this system because i think it can have more false signals, but if you're interested in this TF, you can continue forward-testing and sharing your results here.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi guys, I try to contribute by posting some of my trades that I took with this system As always, great job tuxTrader . This one I took several hours ago...EURGBP, H1 TF and its already +26 pips

Tux , great system, what do we use the MA cloud in the RSI panel for?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
RSI in Daily support? hmmm...I thought its already in pink resistance area and ready to go down? or am I missing something here? But I'm not taking it yet since its not broke the EMA 21...

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Lets go

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I have two template for this system. the one is more simple for short-term or scalping method and other one that also includes EMAs cloud will be use for long-term or swing-trading method. the only usage of cloud is for observation of price in support or resistance zone. there is not something complicated about it.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Phoenix, if your scalping and going for support than your correct, wasn't sure if your looking long term or not

--- 帖子 #87 ---
+55 pips

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Tux, just a question, if price is above resistance/below support you say it would be better to skip long/short the trade under the "Long Term Method" rules. But the second example chart, EURJPY, on your PDF, under Short Term Method shows a short entry when price is above resistance zone. I just wonder skipping the trade rule is valid only for long term method. Considering the logic, that rule should apply to both methods, IMO. What do you think? Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I was also wondering about this point, good question.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
you answered the question yourself! this rule is only for long-term method. in short-term method we are looking to catch any possible move of the price towards the position of the support and resistance zone.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Detto..yes I'm scalping it

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks. Then the current short position on GPUSD is valid according to rules. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #93 ---
there is enough space till resistance zone, so yes it's valid

Watching AUDNZD for short, a couple of AUD pairs and NZDJPY but no down arrow yet.

Hi Tux Is there a way to get notifications (Arrow) and MA cross without all the charts open?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I'm glad not taking this one..it bounce back the EMA line, not crossing it.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I'm currently developing a dashboard for this system for easy monitoring of all pairs. I'm not sure about arrow but we should wait and see how it goes ...

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I did what you said. Everything looks fine except my chart doesn't show 5 lines for tp and resistance. and I don't see fibo levels either. how to turn them on. Thank you

--- 帖子 #133 ---
You will only see them once you enter a trade.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
fibo levels shown only when you have an open position on your chart. but about the rest you're still doing something wrong! when you load the template you should see all things correct. make sure all indicators are in correct path without any additional folders (\MQL4\Indicators) and the template in correct path (\templates) and the dll file in correct path (\MQL4\Libraries), then restart mt4 platform once and then run template. please stop posting here untill you do this correctly. you can send me pm later. thank you

EURAUD, Buy Scalping Trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) I did not get your point. you mean DzTDI or rsi ?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I have closed both GU and EU before it went up again ... gain my daily target of 50 pips. Thanks Tux for this amazing system and indicators I'm off trading for today, stay safe and keep healthy guys

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks, red one (DzTDI). So on your chart, crossover (OBV vs. DzTDI) happened 14 bars ago and then price crossed EMA 21. If it was 25 bars ago or more, would you still accept the setup as valid? Or do you not take bar count into account? Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Your OBV is not similar with mine? hmmm..why? maybe different broker right? I've got 12,2 pips from GU and 10,7 pips from EU just now. Plus the previous 2 trades, Its enough for me today Going to watch The Old Guard on Netflix now..

--- 帖子 #168 ---
anyone watching EURUSD..? is that valid set up?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I don't take bar count into account. the important stuff is position of OBV related to DzTDI that if it had been below or above DzTDI recently.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
It's a valid setup, but wait for close of current candle...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
For me, yes, opened short at 1572, already +20. EDIT: my EMA21 was @1573.5 and previous bar closed @ 1571.1 Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #172 ---
short term or long, cause TTI still in blue...?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
hi tux, i hope you made telegram group for better discussion

--- 帖子 #174 ---
short-term ... for long-term is not a valid setup because both tti and atr/CL shows up trend and also price is above resistance zone. and usually we have less than around 4~5 long-term trades and more than 15 short-term trades in week.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi Tux When I scan the pairs I will see setups but no arrows, I then switch between the two templates and then the alert and arrow appear. Is this a regular occurrence or just on my side

how to place TTI in to RSI window..?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi, about appearance of arrows i think it's normal as it's repainting sometimes. but if this happens most of the times, there may be a problem.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
in default template it's already in RSI window. but you can change via this setting: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I'm glad that this system has caught your attention. I should say that i'm very busy for developing of dashboard for this system and other matters of life so i'm not going to share all of my trades from now on. but if there is an educational point or there will be any questions about this system, i will be here. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Suggestion of new indicators addition or changes in the system without prior coordination is not accepted in this thread. thank you for your understanding.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
great system tuxtrader,pls can i place my entries EVEN if tti and atr/CL are gray when other conditions are met or i should wait for ithem to turn (blue) for buy &amp; pink for sell. thanks

--- 帖子 #193 ---
for long-trem trading all conditions must be met, but for short-term or scalping you don't need tti and atr/CL confirmation. please read the pdf file and the thread from the first page carefully. thank you

Nice work here @Tux

--- 帖子 #199 ---
yes i have read the pdf over and over and nearly all the thead comments. for long term trades in the 3rd step you said it should be gray OR blue (BUY) and gray OR (SELL) The third step is to look at tti/D1 &amp; atr/CL to confirm the direction of higher timeframe. it should be gray (consolidation) or blue (up trend) for buy and gray (consolidation) or pink (down trend) for sell for both TTI and atr center line. i just want to know if i can still place my trade even if TTI &amp; art/ CL yet to turn blue or pink

--- 帖子 #200 ---
hello everyone. how to have only currency pairs on symbol changer plus indicator

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Be careful..It went back and re-crossed the EMA on the opposite directions.. btw, how many hours ago you take this pic?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi General Lee, Its not valid according to my opinion since its not crossed the EMA and went back up. I'm not taking this trade

--- 帖子 #209 ---
No crossover yet in RSI window, so it's not valid. also it seems even if we see a downward crossover, there will not be enough space for price to move ...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I took the screenshot a few minutes before I posted it. if it close below EMA I will close the trade

--- 帖子 #211 ---
the candle not closed yet above ema21, so it's not valid yet ...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
If its a long term set up trade, do we still need to wait for OBV line to be cross and below red line? It does not say in PDF

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Phoenix, I think GU trade.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hmmm my candle closed about EMA21.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Yes you're right. For GU, the OBV is still above the TDI lines. and its not crosses the EMA. so its not a valid trade too

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi TuxTrader I do not know the red line. Like you said I put the dll file in the library. Please help.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
it should close above ema21 obviously ...

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi TUX Trader, Tnx for sharing this perfect system, Is this a valid setup if candle close below EMA21?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
No, it's not a valid setup based on your chart and your OBV line. the OBV is above DzTDI and there isn't downward crossover yet.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Thanks for prompt reply

--- 帖子 #210 ---
EU short term sell in 10 minutes? The only problem is that OBV has been below TDI for two days.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
yes it's a valid sell setup after current candle close. Edit: it's not a problem! after some testings i got that you can also take these trades...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #213 ---
it seems you changed the settings of your DzTDI indicator. it's wrong ...

Scalp Trade..lets see..critic please..I think all is good here..

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Regular non scalp Buy trade..would like to be more in the blue zone, but grey is also ok..tux, critic?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi driven18 well done! both trades that you took are based on advanced rules that i didn't mention till now. based on regular rules of scalping we shouldn't take trade when we have crossover on other side. in both case you see upward crossover of OBV &amp; dzTDI in resistance zone (pink area) but we see that price is in valley after downward move of price and also tti &amp; atr/CL shows strong up trend of daily timeframe, so we can scalp in this case. good luck

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Tux, what do you think of this purchase when the candle closes above the average of 21

--- 帖子 #221 ---
It's a good buy setup if candle closes above ema21 &amp; top line of resistance zone. notice that the resistance zone is broken by the price and becomes to support zone.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
[quote = tuxTrader; 13078729] {quote} Es una buena configuración de compra si la vela se cierra por encima de ema21 y la línea superior de la zona de resistencia. observe que la zona de resistencia se rompe por el precio y se convierte en zona de soporte. [/ quote] Too bad it's Friday, and I don't think the market will change much until closing. And Sunday in the opening may already be another scenario

--- 帖子 #223 ---
yes, it's better to wait for next week that probably we have another scenario.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
It seems as if depending on where you are in the world you will get different results because each chart seems to be different, it may be just the brokers are different, I have looked at quite a lot of the charts and compared them to my charts, I live in the UK, some of my charts show good entry points, but some of them are losing entry points, For example these two charts I've just put on, The person who chart it is put a sell trade on, My chat is a buy trade, just something to remember, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I should also say mine is the bottom chart and there's no arrow showing

--- 帖子 #226 ---

The first important stuff is that not every trading system is supposed to be the same for everyone, trader's skills and experiences are also influential in this market. the second point is that i introduced a free trading system that was profitable for me and i'm not going to prove whether this system is profitable or not for everyone and it is the duty of everyone who is going to use this system to investigate whether it is profitable for them or not. another point about this system (especially scalping method) is that you should take as possible as trading opportunities to succeed. in last week i had 6 losses and about 20 wins with more than 400 pips profit so this point is important! the crossover is only a sign that we should look for buy or sell trade opportunity after that. but the more important point is position of price related to support/resistance zone that you should pay attention to. in the first cropped picture that you sent, the price is in top of resistance zone and it's very close to top line of zone and there isn't any sign that shows price is going to break the resistance zone, so it's not a valid setup. about EA buy trade that you asked, i should say that it's an advanced trade. based on regular rules, you see that entry candle closed exactly on bottom line of support zone but i said before that in this cases the entry candle should closes above bottom line of support zone. now we should go back and look around red vertical line that upward crossover happened. we see that there is multiple candle closed above bottom line of support zone before and after vertical line. so we were already preparing for the buy deal and we were sure that it would most likely break the support area.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
First of all, I would like to say I was not criticising you or your system, And I would like to thank you for all your hard work a job well done, The only reason I pointed out what I pointed out was, There's a lot of people who come on to these sites and think it's The Holy Grail and the truth is, It doesn't exist, Has for your system I would call it a success like you say 6 losses and 20 wins last week you couldn't call it anything else. Good luck and keep safe

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I know we've got alarms on these pairs. I was just wondering as we've got 28 pairs to check whether we could have some sort of agreement, Where if someone spots what they consider to be a trade to put a picture the chart on within 15-minutes of someone spotting it, so we could all analyse it at the same time, that way we would all be helping each other. It's just an idea not trying to change the system in any way whatsoever, just don't like missing trade s,

Both trades failed as very clearly, there was no crossing of the 21 EMA, and close of bar under 21 EMA. Remember, the name for success is "Patience". Me myself made the same mistake many times due to lack of patience.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Thank you for your reply. I thought I had almost complete set of conditions to take these trades by Long-Term method (beside EMA 21 crossing). Unfortunatelly, 1 missed check mark beat 5 others.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Did anyone take UCAD H1 long on the scalp? It's close to SL. I was thinking of exiting when the OBV crossed back down under the TDI. Do you all use any loss exit methods like that or just let it hit SL? Otherwise I've been making some profitable trades over the last few days. thumbs up

--- 帖子 #273 ---
friend i don't speak english very well and i have some doubts, can someone help me, 1- ok the crossing occurred, it is recent and it is in a resistance zone 2- the color is blue, you need to wait for it to turn red, right? 3- the ball is green, you need to wait for it to turn red, correct? 4- you need to wait for the crossing and the candle closes below the line, correct? 5- also wait for the arrow to appear obs everything is above the pink line after the entry the take goes on the pink line, on sale, correct?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
TTI and Center Line of ATR channel shows trend direction of daily timeframe and they doesn't change very quickly and easily, so when you see that tti/D1 &amp; atr/CL doesn't confirm the trend, you should skip this pair for long-term method and you shouldn't go for other steps to check. on the other hand, when you see the price is above resistance zone, you should skip this pair for long-term method unless the price come back inside resistance zone and entry candle will be inside resistance zone. also waiting for arrow and close of candle bellow/above ema21 (sell/buy) are final confirmation when all other conditions met before. i see most of the times that most of traders don't have patience and don't wait for final confirmations...

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I closed UC with profit in the last hours of last week (Friday), because i normally don't keep trades over the week, especially when it's in profit. but for now, if it's near SL it's better to keep that to see what happens...

I am studying to understand friend, thank you for your patience, if you have time and can show in photos it becomes clearer that I understand what you said now, or showing what is wrong in my photo, about the resistance being above the line I understood, so the ideal is to be inside even I suppose the blue and pink resistance,

--- 帖子 #277 ---
sorry, i'm very busy for now. i think there is enough examples and information from the beginning of thread till now. also read the pdf file again and practice on demo account.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
1- ok the crossing occurred, it is recent and it is in a resistance zone All three (OBV-blue line, dzTDI-red line and cloud-gray) should be in blue or pink area, for long term method you don't need to check if OBV crosses red line, it is for short term scalping method. 2- the color is blue, you need to wait for it to turn red, right? Yes, correct, for sell trade. 3- the ball is green, you need to wait for it to turn red, correct? Incorrect. The colour of that ball has nothing to do with the strategy. It just shows if price is falling or rising. 4- you need to wait for the crossing and the candle closes below the line, correct? First you need to see if red/green arrow is there, and then you need to wait for price to close below/above EMA 21. 5- also wait for the arrow to appear See answer 4 obs everything is above the pink line after the entry the take goes on the pink line, on sale, correct? Not clear what you mean And as tux told you, please read pdf, everything you need is there with examples. Regards, Blackeagle

Hi it's a valid long-term buy setup. only it's better to set TP on TP3/TP4 level and after price reached to TP2 level, move your Sl...

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) What do you think about that trade?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thank you for the confirmation and advice, tux. I'm thinking for try this system to see the level of win-lose probability. So for example every 10, or 20 or 50 or maybe 100 valid trade, how many win and how many lose will I get. So start now I put the SL-TP to 1:1. What do you think about that tux? Or, have you ever tried it?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
This is my view on this chart, looks like it should be a buy instead of a sell, I know it's sometime later than when you put it on but I am looking at the moving averages they wide apart represent a strong trade, Attached Image (click to enlarge)

First of i would like to thank the creator of this system and just say that i appreciate very much the time he has spent writing the rules down. I think not all the conditions are met, the D1 TTI is gray and the price is still above the resistence zone, am i correct?

This is a good trade, one negative - too close to Resistance that can become Support, but I took it.

from what I understand the color of the tti bar needs to be pink to sell, I see many here selling with it blue .... we have to clear this doubt with the author

i think that the rules are very clear, since i am getting used to the method i wanted to confirm, more like a brain check that anything else.

Hi guys !!!! Nice thread you have here :-) I usually scalp DAX and I was looking for something to help me trading "long term" in forex and it look promising. I´m reading the whole thread to get the grip to it, but I´m a bit anxious, so sorry if my question was made/answered before. It is about the arrow thing. For the long term: once points 1,2 and 3 are OK, I have to wait for the arrow and the EMA21 cross and close, that is OK My Q is: the arrow have to appear after all previous conditions ? Or it is OK if we are in a zone after an arrow that is there several bar before ? Sorry for my english :-)

closed based on percentage of ADR(Not the very clever idea). Im still monitoring trade openings. So will analyze for best option to close later. Some closed manual.

@tux trader &amp; @all other user that use this templates, First, sorry if my language is so bad (im learning now) Second, just want a confirmation is the pink box (resistance line on the main chart) is the main focus area? I mean what if the signal show when the price below resistance line? Does signal is still solid or no?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
The two pink lines and 2 blue blues are marked high and low points of the previous two weeks candles,they can be used as support and resistance ,when price cross above the 2 pink lines and the rs i&amp; moving averages makes a u turn from below ,that means the price on that instruments for the current is likely to go higher .vise-versa for blue lines. How ever if the price is above the 2 pink lines and the rsi and m/avg are up (70/80)% its either a stop hunt by Market makers or the market is trending .same goes for the 2 blue lines. If price comes below the 1st pink line the second pink line can/may serve as support mind you not always.any thing can happen in forex trading. Same goes for the blue lines. If market is ranging there is likely hood that the price move from pink line as entry and blue line as target vise versa or make a u turn at any of the tp levels . I stand to be corrected nobody knows all.

You do not need to set any colours - there are two .set files provided. Apply one of those and the entire system sets itself. I think you should look for information on how to use MT4 - it is extremely simple but not always obvious for beginners.

Go to settings of Symbol_Changer_PLUS and add full name of currencies or symbol names that you don't want to show to " Excluded List " input list. another way is to delete unwanted pairs from Market Watch in MT4 platform.

What an awesome strategy iv read all comment's I'm going to read the pdf and then I'm on board just a quick question how long roughly is the scalp option and the long term trade. Anyone with a quick link for pdf as I'm using mobile. There is no way I can attach these templates via mobile only on laptop.As I'm using mt4 via Google store.i have mt4 on my laptop I usually trade supply and demand via trading view. But I'm looking at this with interest and subscribed many thanks tux.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Do you have any comment on my trade? Also, I'm watching for long-term trade with NJ. Can I join it right now? Is it too late?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
All is right based on rules. about NJ you missed the primitive entry but still you can enter the buy trade if price is on retrace.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Is UJ valid for a scalp?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
yes it's valid. but it's better to wait for another candle to close below ema21

Where is the crossover of DzTdi and OBV in your chart? To me that rule is not so clear.In a buy trade, the blue line must cross the red line from below?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
No crossover needed for a long-term trade. Both were in oversold area, so it is a valid entry.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Does it look like a long-term trade to you? Where is the EMAs?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
TTI and EMAs cloud are necessary for long term trade.

I bottled it I should have let it run but I seen a strong resistance in front and I'm in work so I couldn't keep my eye on it didn't want a bounce off it well happy 90pips greed in this game this system is looking good I must say what percentage is this got to be 70-80% win rate.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
@TUXTrader and @all, why is it important to wait for the candle to close either above or below the ema before taking a position? After all the other rules have been satisfied, is it not better to enter wiles price is still below or above the ema? My thought is that this reduces the SL (risk)? Sorry if question is silly

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Nice entry...you're already at the right path bro keep it up! My suggestion to you (If you're new to trading), open a real trade account with real money. You can find a broker that support cent account and trade with ease since cent account will be 100 times your deposit amount to trade with. (you can deposit 10 USD and your account will be 1000 USC) In my experience, trading with demo is practically useless since you cannot experience real commission, real spread, real re-quote etc that mimic the real live trading situations. For instance, you did 10 lot of trading in a single trade positions. That will not happened in the real live trading unless you applied a tied money management and decent R/R even if you have 100k in your account

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hey all, Came across this system yesterday and have been obsessed. Went through most of the replies and seems like everyone here is really enjoying it. I'm a 30m PA trader but this H1 swing method seems very appealing due to less stress and chart time. I am about to implement the system over the weekend and test it for a while, very excited. Does anyone have a running record they would like to share with things like net pips, net %, etc. Would help give me an idea of the effectiveness and what to expect. Thanks guys, bless

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi, the session isn't important for me but usually the best trades happen on London and NewYork session.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Good Day @TuxTrader, Indeed the thread is full of appreciations. Thank you for sharing such a system. I would like to try this system on lower time frames. But not sure about the parameter settings. Could you please advise whether it is worth to try this system on lower time frames like M15, M5 or even M1? If possible, could you advise on parameter settings? (I clearly know from your PDF that you only use H1.)

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Good Morning all, A little bit of insight to start your trading day.. have fun catching those pips today

--- 帖子 #433 ---
For sure the Tux Trading System teaches you discipline and patience.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
This was my first attempt at the system last night. Everything look good? Had the arrow, RSI resistance, close under ema, and crossed. Also, how do I remove pairs from the symbol changer? Tried in setting but cant find where the list is, thanks!

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I'm not experienced trader, but it doesn't seems good according to TuxTrader PDF. The price broke the resitance level so you did not waited for the price to return to the resistance zone. Expert may comment better! I may be wrong!

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Dear TuxTrader, I do not have a dashboard. Can you recommend a dashboard for MT4? @members, Anyone welcome to recommend a dashboard...

In mt4 open the Market Watch window and right click on a pair then choose delete. Once you have the pairs to the level you desire, save that list via the Symbols &gt; Save as &gt; any name you like

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi,Phonenix99. Can you explain how to use this information? Can you share the template? Best regards.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
That is daily fundamental analysis that I see BEFORE I start looking at my chart windows for technical analysis. But if there's a big "red" forex related news such as NFP or FOMC in the particular day, usually this kind of analysis can be obsolete, But according to my experience, you can immediately know (compared it to previous day analysis) which currency, index, or indices that move to certain position on the spot, which pair is the strongest/weakness, vice versa...Hope that make sense.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Nice catch! But why you change the template look?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
My humble suggestion to you.. If you trade in higher TF (H1 and above). Invest your time first at the beginning of your trading day to scan as much pair/index/indices that you can, then select at least 10 pairs that according to you is the most prospect during the next 24 hours and ONLY focus on that, try not be distracted. If you used TTS, and doing this in the daily basis, you can easily get at least 50-100 pips daily. That's huge result if you can be consistent remember, we do a marathon run here, not a sprint. 2 weeks ago, I trade like crazy and try to catch and scalp all opportunity occurs in front of my eyes...Yes my account grow like 56+% in a week, but I've really exhausted. This week I only trade 10 trades max daily (with more less same result) because I do this first and learn to let go some opportunity that not on my watch list. Hope this help bro...good luck

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Phoenix99, Can you talk about your criterias for pairs selection for this week to narrow down to 10 pairs? Is this dashboard available? If you can not share it, can you point to a place where I can copy it or buy it?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hello, Which tool du you use for find most interesting pair for scalping?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
This indicator (not dashboard) is one of the tools that I used when I start my trading day. I spend not more than 3 minutes looking at it, then I make some notes, then do confirmation from the related chart pairs using TTS. You can fine tune it as you want (edit, take out, put in pairs, index, etc). Then I wait for the right time to enter the position for that 10 pairs. I don't know if @tuxtrader allowed me to put this indicator here though. I have 2 list. One is called a main list, second is a daily 10 list. The main list consist of some pairs/index/indices that I like. All this pair that I choose are from my years of trading experiences so It definitely be different from your trading list (if you choose to create one) since I trade index/indices too such as USOIL, DEX30, NASDAQ, US30, etc. I have 35 pairs in my main list. Then I have daily list consist of only 10 pairs that keep changing in daily basis. So for example, for my next Monday list, usually that list is a continuation from my Friday trading list plus/minus my review on Monday morning but the amount is the same only 10 pairs I look in daily for the next 24 hours. I'm from Asia continent, so I usually start my trading day during half of Asia Session towards the London session. Hope this help.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi, tux Trader. How is the dashboard development progressing? I was very impressed with the system. We look forward to the completion of the dashboard.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Very good advice Pheonix, thank you much. You say 10 pair max daily now but that seems like a ton with this system. You doing long term and scalp method? I've only been looking at this system a few days and scalp only and seems like its around 3-5 trade ideas a day. And wow thats incredible return. My eventual goal with this system is around 30% return per month so thats good news. Thanks for your ongoing support of this thread!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi phoenix any chance of a name I could search for that analysis indicator so I could know where to look through out the day to help me along as long if it's OK with Tux many thanks

--- 帖子 #455 ---
To be fully transparent, I will post my trading result of that week I've mentioned previously. In that particular week, I'm trading like half crazy chasing all the opportunity with all pairs/index/indices that I can look at. Corrections, I've traded 102 times (all with TTS) that week and yield 56+% growth, but it consume both my stamina and mental since I practically trades 24 hours non stop. So Yes, if your current target is 30% monthly, it's very achievable with TTS. Thank you too, we will always learn and earn together here b

Great work. A couple questions here. Since your zoom was slightly off, does that mean those early setups were invalid? also, how long is a trade valid after the cross and/or arrow occur, this one crossed a while ago. Last question is just what is that large red bar on the right side? Thanks Phoenix

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Bro...you are correct! All of my early setups were invalid and my account today (and for the last 2 weeks I've been using this wonderful system) is not growing at all Btw, today I over trades (again)...maybe because its a holiday here, everybody is going somewhere for long weekend, I've got nothing to do...etc. And turns out today I've already traded freakin' 40 positions and still going!, I don't know if this is the right thing to do? I'm still learning and evolving as well. To be fully transparent, I will post my result here.. That red/green candle was only my daily trend indicator for additional confirmation. Don't mind that.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
NZD/USD, was a nice buy setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #484 ---
My 2 cents for you.. For you first trade, you don't have the sell arrow confirmation yet and trading very exotic pairs such as SGD is not advisable for us retail trader. Try to focus on maybe 20 to 30 pairs that you like the most (not too exotic). As time goes by you will know more of their "behavior" such as their max/min daily ATR movements, which pair they crossover with (for instance if XAU is going down USD will be up, or XAU is up UCAD is down, XAU is up EU is up, etc), or following fundamental news related to your focus pair. Second trade, I agree..it should be at least 1 candles before your entry point Third trade, Hmmmm...yes I agree too. But you have to make sure what is the daily trend of the particular trade that you want to enter too. Is it same direction? If you see your chart of this GU, its clear the trend is up. NEVER open positions that contradict with the trend. Unless you trade in daily TF, then you have to see trend in Weekly TF vice versa.. Fourth trade, Its the combination of your first and third trade. You missed the beast arrow confirmation and the daily trend is up for this EC pairs. Hope this help try to practice more...rest assured you're at the right system here bro

Yes, this is the main one I was referencing, your last post. My OBV especially is different, only seeing a couple trade opportunities a day. Also my weekly hi/low seems to be different

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi Sarju, That's mladen daily candle trend, you can find it here in forex factory. I've been using that for years. I don't know if @tuxtrader allowed me to upload it here. And for the time/clock indicator, you already have it. Please look at Symbol_changer_plus indicator and play around with the settings. You will surely find plenty of hidden gem there.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Ok...this is more technical coding stuff but my guess is because you are using different broker than mine. So logically the calculation is slightly different. But looking at the chart that you post (AN), it's also screaming sell to me bro, for at least last 2 or 3 candles...same as my chart. The blue OBV line is also below the red DzTDI line.

The directions the OBV and DzTDI are pointing to matters, especially when you see them exiting either from strong resistance or support, heading down or up. Meanwhile, check your inbox

FWIW, added a 9 EMA set to close, which helps to filter counter trend entries. It may or may not be helpful to some in reducing the losing percentages.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Thank you for your help! I got into this trade so far.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
tuxTrader Thanks for starting this thread, you are appreciated. Will it be possible for you to update TUX AutoFibo and include the options to either allow automatic SL and TP. Turning the TUX AutoFibo to Script Order placing tool may be the best option, anyway I am not a coder, you guys know better.

Good afternoon fellow TTS traders, There's 3 (yes you read it right)..MAJOR news coming our today so please be careful when you take your entry. In my experience I don't trade at least 1 hour before/after the major news. So I'm thinking if I skip half day today just to be safe. If you see this AU chart, it matches all of our TTS rules but immediately it went up when the GBP news come out. This thing happens since we can only predict and analyze the market but all that major bank (read:market maker) control the market. So trend can be bias, indicator can be wrong, etc during this time. For market insight, We see JPY pairs is going down hard due their economic slump (down 7,8%, their worst since 1955), surprisingly the other save havens (precious metals) is also weaken... So on the other side, when both of their safe havens currency is down, the stock market will flourish... as seen today all the index around the world are jumping to their highest level. Also, for our members from HK, be safe guys...hope this Typhoon is not really bad. Good luck and have fun today

--- 帖子 #508 ---
This one look good...considering it

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Wait for it...30 mins to candle close

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Another one...remember our rules guys...patience until this candle close below EMA first then we enter. If not, don't push it.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
More...yes, it a risky trade... I'm in already. The reason is because I see OBV line is already in the overbought zone and heading down towadrs the DzTDI line. Let see, I might be wrong here...

Yes it is, I've got the same problem as yours when I start but its all good now...So, you go to your indicator list and edit your Symbol_changer_PLUS indi. There you will find suffix and enter your suffix extension .lmax then click save. See pic for more detail. Hope this help

--- 帖子 #515 ---
All fixed now. Thank you. Did anyone try this on lower time frames like M15? thinking of trying, but maybe someone already did and will tell me that it is not worth the time and effort and doesn't work well on lower times frames.

Is entering a short trade while On Balance Volume is already in a blue zone is regarded still as a good entry and is not out of the rules? (Your GBPCAD trade). As long as it is under TDI, there was an arrow and EMA cross, it is still ok to enter the trade even if On Balance Volume is that low? Just trying to understand all the rules and tricks so that I don't make unnecessary mistakes.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Puccini, Good questions. So as you might now, I was following high impact news all day today. And when I take that trade, I'm doing a scalping trade (I don't intend to hold it for a long time) so I am "following my guts" to enter the trade right after the big EUR news came out. And No, I'm not violating any rules since its still on the TTS scalping rules. Its more advanced trading method and to be honest I rarely do this. And the result? it drops 36+ pips on a single candle

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I see, thank you for clarification. Also I see you have removed the D1 TMA bands from your chart. Is it not very useful?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
update high level

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Here is my first trade using this system. Entry was late, but as price hasn't moved far from original entry point, and all conditions were still in place, I took that trade, with TP1 at 1st RR zone and TP2 at the second, though closed the later one manually a bit too early. Seems very promising, as there are more trades running in profit now, and looking at history, there could have been great trades as well. Ah wish I found this thread earlier lol

Hello Phonenix, the size of the chart window effects the OBV indicator window even though the zoom has been adjusted as per pdf. What is the solution to this problem? Sarju

--- 帖子 #524 ---
What is your display resolution settings? the default for this is 1366x768. Pls check

--- 帖子 #525 ---
1920 x 1080, but regardless of display resolution, changing the chart size would still effect the OBV indicator. Sarju

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Sorry..I don't get your question, you said that your chart windows size effecting your OBV windows right? OR your OBV appearance is different than my OBV appearance? if so, I already answer it previously. It has to do with us using different brokers, so the calculation by our OBV indicator result is obviously different. Hope this help.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Sorry for the confusion, If you change the size of your chart, does the appearance of your OBV indicator remain the same or change ? . In my laptop if I maximize the chart, then the appearance looks like your chart, but if the chart window size is changed then this changes the appearance. Sarju

Thank you all traders for contribution and advance this thread. The following indicator shows correct and default chart's zoom of TTS Strategy. if the zoom is correct it shows green button otherwise it shows red button. also when you click on button it changes the chart's zoom to correct zoom. you should pay attention that default zoom of TTS may be different for some people according to differences in resolution and scale settings that in this case you should ignore this indicator and you should try other chart's zoom to find the correct zoom as similar to most trader's chart. but I believe that the default zoom is the same for most traders.

Hello dear fellow traders First i would like to thank TuxTrader for this great system and thread. I read all the comments and I really see the value of this strategy. I would also like to thank everybody who contributed with their charsts/setups and explainations! I would like to say that i am profitable as my first week of trading this system (5% growth). I was trading long method. I am now "getting my feet wet" with the short variation of the system and have a question/comment. It is as member Sradia mentioned regarding zoom of the chart. In PDF it is mentioned that one must zoom in (max) and then zoom out 2 times (2-) OR 3 times (3-). In long method i think it is not as important if you use 2- or 3-, but in short method we look for a cross and i found that 2- and 3- sometimes present different results (cross is there OR cross is not there or not there yet). I will attach 4 charts (2 different pairs and 2 different ways zoom effects the chart) where this is evident and the zoom of the chart can determine the entry. EURNZD: In the first printscreen we have 2- zoom and the cross is definitely there but in the second printscreen (3-) the cross is NOT there (blue bounces off red). AUDJPY: In this example the zoom determines the position of the cross, in 3- zoom the cross is in the grey part of the RSI and on the 2- zoom, the cross is on the blue part of the RSI. I hope my explainations are clear. Thank you for your toughts and comments.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
TuxTrader you answered the question/solved the problem almost at the same time i asked/stated it. Thank you for your indicator and for this wonderful strategy in general.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hello Tuxtrader, There should be a standard number of candles on the chart. This indicator checks the chart if it's in the correct number of zooms but still there will be problems if someone enlarges the chart with the correct number of zoom. According to my observation we need to have around 270 candles on the chart. That should be the correct zoom regardless of number of times that we zoomed the chart. Again, the key for the correct zoom should be the number of candles we observe on the chart which is around 270 candles. You may want to give the exact number from your own charts. Regards, Hüseyin.

My graph looks complete different to yours even though my zoom is confirmed correct by the Tux indicator (top right of indicator window). Edit :- Just played around with the zoom of the graph and managed to replicate your graph exactly by zooming in all the way and then zooming back out twice, so i will stick to this zoom for now.

--- 帖子 #543 ---

--- 帖子 #568 ---
It seems like your zoom is not exactly by the rules of the author isn't it? His manual says max zoom in then zoom out 3 times. It looks like you are using chart that is zoomed out 2 times, therefore your indicators shows different value. See below, image one is zoomed out 2 times like yours, and image two is zoomed out 3 times as per author's manual. Does that work well for you?

--- 帖子 #569 ---

I can tell you because nobody buys anymore very bad chart can not see anything m15 m30 H1 H4

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Only thing what I see that is not by the book is that price is close to resistance (pink lines) and should be near support (blue lines) instead for opening long position. you could have some small scalp profit on that trade if you entered on vertical red line before the price collapse

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Its ok mate...Please look at #post 531

--- 帖子 #577 ---
YES, this is the solution for 1080p monitors (1920x1080 resolution). I'll try to implement this feature on next version of TTS_ZoOM to configure it automatically (if possible!)... Thank You

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Your zoom is definitely different to the majority of people in this thread, although you seem to be finding success with your trades so i can't quite tell who's in the wrong. Although the tux indicator is suggesting your zoom is correct, it isn't exactly accurate as it depends on the resolution of your screen. As suggested previously there needs to be roughly 272 candles on your screen which yours definitely does not have .

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I admire your confidence to tell me that I'm wrong bro, but sorry...you are the one that wrong on this one (kindly see the attachment). My candles is EXACTLY 272 (not roughly) and my resolution when I search for entry is 1366x768. Thanks also for the compliment, my success so far is because this awesome system really works! (my result so far as proof of it) and maybe I'm a little bit faster to learn it, adapt it, then implemented it to my ongoing trading style nicely and smoothly. Its critical also for you to understand what is your present trading style, especially for someone like me that already trades for several years. Luckily for me, my last system that I used to trades really can compliment this TTS very much. So for this system to work, maybe you have to make a drastic change to your present trading style?or not? Every person has to undergo their own adaptation process, there's no short cut for that. I'll give you example, let say your previous trading strategy is London Breakout (because maybe you are 9 to 5 office staff that cant spend so many times in front of your MT4). Your trading day start 20 minutes before UK Market open, you scan the chart only for several GBP and EU related pairs, only for more less 15 minutes, you look at different TF (maybe only H1 dan D1), make quick analysis, draw some S/R lines, (this you can do it all in your mobile), then when market open you just wait for breakout and enter, set TP/SL and off you go doing whatever you want to do. If you are very lucky, you will got 2 trades going the way you want and 1 or 2 to in minus...some days are bad days some days are good days...(btw London break out strategy is not profitable in the long run, I've try it sooo many times before, even with help of EA too). Lets compare it to TTS. Here, you can have so many entry opportunity in practically every hour (if you want to scalp it like I do, my record so far was 40+ trades a day and my weekly trades were 102+ trades all use TTS, ..You just cant stop. Its addictive to make money with this system. luv it!.. ). You have to be more pro active to the market. Make your decisions after decisions, adrenaline rush, scan again and again many pairs in your watch list, etc. Your daily/weekly/monthly trading plan will be much more complicated compared to London Break out strategy...and the result? last week only I've gained 640+ pips..result don't lie bro... And for traders who prefer long term trades, TTS had rules for it too.. This is just me sharing my experience, maybe it works for me but not for others idk Rest assured, if I can do it, you can do it also

--- 帖子 #580 ---
First of all...please ss it again. This time pls crop your entire chart windows so we can see what is happening at that particular moment when you decide to make your entry. There's a purpose why we should have more less 272 candles seen on one single windows every time we've search for opportunity. You know why?

--- 帖子 #581 ---
agreed

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hello Phoneix99, Do you have a different version of TT_Zoom, as the input option "Shift Percent = 17" with number of candles on chart 272, is not present in version uploaded by tuxTrader ?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
No, it was only a test version. I didn't release any new version of TTS_ZoOM yet. But for now until I release the new version, everyone with any resolution should do this: step by step solution to prepare the chart for TTS: 1- Make sure you have the correct zoom by using TTS_ZoOM v1.0 or manually in this way: “Max zoom in and then zoom out 3 times” or “Max zoom out and then zoom in 2 times” If your resolution is 1366*768, you don't need to do other steps and step 1 is enough. 2- Press F8 and set a color on Grid. now you should see the Chart slider (small triangle) on top of chart. 3- Move the Chart slider until you see 272 number of candles on left side of chart. to measure the number of candles you should use Crosshair tools (Ctrl+F). If you can't set 272 number of candles, any number from 270 to 273 is also valid. 4- Press F8 again and set None color on Grid. 5- Save the template . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hi tuxTrader., I have tried what you shown above but my chart don't look the same as you. How to I get the count of number of bar displayed on screen. Thanks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hi, use Crosshair tools (Ctrl+F) and drag from current (newest candle) till first visible candle of chart in left side. what's your resolution ?

--- 帖子 #586 ---
TuxTrader, thanks for your reply. My resolution 1366 X 768.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
My resolution is also 1366 X 768. So you don't need to change anything and the default template with correct zoom should show the same chart as my chart.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Thanks, I've got it to look the same as you now.

i traded GBPUSD for long

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Your trade entry is around the time when EUR currency high impact news occurs, so all GBP pairs eventually reverse back because the EUR news result was positives. Lesson learned, please always check daily forex market news first before you start trading, then better you filter your trading pairs. Avoid pairs that related to the news currency. I usually take a break 1 hour before/after a high impact news happened, like I do now. Hope this help.

thank you tuxTrader for this system

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I think all rules is already in the pdf. Your next step would be to practice it as much as you can. There's no short cut to it. TTS is a simple yet powerful system, so you will be mastering it in no time. It took me more less 1,5 weeks to get me comfortable with this awesome system. After hundreds of trades, hours of learning it, then I am set to go You can demo it for a while, post screen shoot of your chart here as many as you can, so we can comment/discuss it together. Doing mistake is part of your learning curve as well. My second suggestion for you, please immediately open a real account as soon as you're comfortable using demo. You can open cent account first that is really safe because its 1/100 compare to your standard account, but its real money so you can then learn to control your emotions, money management, adrenaline rush, re-quote from your broker, commissions, etc that you will never learn if you only using demo account. Then your final step will be stepping up one more step by using standard account. Don't forget to use leverage/type of account that can support your trading style as well. For instance, if you are a scalper like me, you have to use ECN account with the lowest commission/spread. Or if you are a swing trader you can look for swap free broker, etc. Regarding your questions, for me is critical you don't ever trade against the trend. So if we find a day like today that so many high impact news dictating the market movement, don't try to fight it...just go with it. After TTS rules confirmation (such as OBV line, EMA crosses, etc), you check the trend first before you make your entry. Hope this make sense. Rest assured you're already in the right place.

What do you mean with check the trend? There are many ways of doing it. How do you do it?

Thank you for the feedback. I will be sure to share some potential setups and some screenshots.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
spot on! I'm still holding it too

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Did you trade today, or sitting out because mostly high impact news? I see some of the the USDCAD and GBPUSD trades posted by others today were affected. Even though those trades were identified well before the news events they didn't really move until the news came out and ended up being stopped out. Would it be better to close them out before the news starts if they havent move to the TP yet?

Hi Pipbros, Actually its a good trading day for me today...I took some related news pairs such as gold (after the news off course)... and non related news pair such as AN. No SL for me today because the spike for USD related pairs is very wild. gold went up for 100+ pips then drop 250+ pips in 1 candle...and "luckily" I catch it I will post some of my trade here...1 that heavily impacted by the news (XA) and 1 position that didn't even touch by the news at all (AN) And for your other questions, it depend what is your trading style. I will remove my S/L for the day like this, or cut loss after my trades going off for certain pips. Its normal for a scalper like me. We have so many opportunity for entry in this TTS setups so our chances of getting those pips back are high For checking the trend, we can always switch to higher TF to check it (H4 or D1 for me) or depends on what is your methods/indicator for checking it. Moving average? Ichimoku? etc.. Hope this answer your questions...

--- 帖子 #655 ---
stupid risk lead to stupid loss, i''m done for today, very weary

--- 帖子 #656 ---
is this a valid setup for entry, I believe it adheres to all the rules except that the candles returned to be above the moving average line and that is making me a bit hesitant?

--- 帖子 #657 ---
My comment is that price is stuck between resistance points. If I was to look at this , I would wait for these points to give more clarity on being still resistance or indeed support. All imo Good luck

--- 帖子 #658 ---
1) You enter when the trend is long and its a strong one too 2) This is TTS Long term system templates that you used, so patience is the key especially if you trade against the trend Hope this help

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Anyone with me in this pair? trend is relatively predictable today... so lets harvest as many pips as we can

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Nice one, could you please explain the use of the red candle forming on your chart. Is this some extra indicator that you make use of?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Awesome day... anyone take this entry?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi, I've answered this similar questions previously.. It just my daily trend indicator that I've been using for years...

--- 帖子 #663 ---
greetings, are you getting any signal alert for valid entry since there were 28 over pairs avail?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
It merely shows how the daily candle is currently developing. nice trades on CJ and UJ. Its still not clear to me how you take your signals with the trend. When looking at the H4 and daily TF the price action doesnt really have a clear downtrend. So I decided to plot the notorious 200 day EMA on the chart and CJ is clearly not in a downtrend on the higher TF's Care to explain your logic of confirming the trend? Do you only stick to the hour TF for taking signals?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hi PipBros, (1) Well, that indicator first release was made by one of the legendary mt4/5 coder named Mladen years ago, It wont fail me yet until today and I don't think it will be. As you already know, I always trade by the directions shown in my chart (following the trend) not the other way around and it saves me so many time not trying to entry in the wrong directions of the current trend. My suggestion is, trading actually not a complicated sequence, so don't make it complicated. If you can, makes all indicator that you need visually in front of you in 1 single chart (for me such as ATR, spread, symbol changer, candle Time, pip numbers, moving average, pivot point, etc..but also my chart have to looks very clean and smooth not overwhelmed by many indicator) and thankfully I found everything I need in this TTS templates. Just follow the already proven system, try it, maybe you can post some of your entry/exit chart here so we can discuss it together, and I'm absolutely sure it will works for you. (2) Yes, I only enter in TTS preferred TF which is H1. Hope this help

Hi Paladin1979, I have my main pair watch list (consist of 36 pairs), this is the one that I've maintained in daily basis. There's so many opportunity with TTS that I've managed to take 40+ trades in a single day when I'm still learning this amazing system 2 weeks back. But nowadays I am only takes more less 10-20 trades a day and let it run. Off course my result will not be as much as if I take it like 2 weeks back but I can relax more and enjoy my life. I turn off my signal alert. but you can always turn it on again and get signal alert if you want. Hope this answer you questions

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hi Phoenix99, Which indi should I turn on the signal alert as there were more than 10 of them at main windows? Appreciate for your time in responded to all inquiries and wish you all the best that world can offer to you. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Good Afternoon guys, No high impact news today except CNY that already behind us. it turns out the result is negatives so immediately impact AUD and JPY related pairs since this 3 countries somehow related to one another. Also, UK banks is on holiday today, so expect a minimum movement from GBP related pairs compared to their daily ATR. Let the pip hunt begin!

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Hi Pheonix99, is it possible for you to share this currency strength panel? or maybe where can we get it?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hi Paladin1979, You can edit your indicator as you like but please always follows TTS rules. If you dive deeper, not all indicators has alert function, so you have to choose by yourself which indicator that fits your trading style it might be different from my trading style, so you have to do your homework, there's no short cut here. I am turning it all off so I don't really can give you recommendations. Hope this make sense to you.

Hello Traders, anyone in this trade?

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Also looking to this trades...

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Yes, I'm in this too..it hit my TP1..but I don't ss it. Kindda busy today. Market really behaving weird today...so I only took 2 or 3 trades then I'm out.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi Phoenix99 , Can you tell me if the GBPCAD was a correct setup for entry today?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hi Kasra, Which GC part are you talking about yesterday? can you make a screen shot of it? But as I said previously, yesterday was a weird trading day. Sometimes this kind of day happens when we cant even trade following the trend. No high impact news but trend is not even feasible anywhere. Maybe the market makers during this kind of day was making money from retail trader like us? idk...During that day, we should be very cautious. I trade less than 5 positions yesterday...and let the days go by.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
This week is NFP week so it will be a spike in the market, will it makes a new reversal trend? we will see.. 6 high impact news today...2 was already behind us...4 to go..and that would be USD, GBP, and EUR related news Btw..AUD and CHF is the weakest during Asia market while NZD is the strongest so far today...Why I circle S&amp;P and NASDAQ with green?..its because for 3 in a row during NFP week this 2 pairs is jump up passing their weekly resistance...maybe they will do so this week for 4rth time in a row? Happy new trading months all, how was you last month result? hopefully we will get much more this month

--- 帖子 #685 ---
any idea how this small box worked? Color can manually selected between pink, blue &amp; grey but what it does mean?

--- 帖子 #687 ---
I think it's your supplier that's causing the problem. If he doesn't offer all the currencies, they don't appear on the chart. You can change the MT4 settings to hide the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look at this link, it can help you: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ngth-indicator I don't know much about this indicator.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hello to all investors ... I've been looking for a strategy that I want to test for some time. I decided on this TUX (TTS) but I can't cope with the settings and view of this strategy. In the attachment I am sending photos on the first one you can see all of my window. There are no visible zones of support and resistance in the blue and pink zones. Can't see the ATR Channel TMA line, can't see green and red arrows, can't see DzTDI red line. I would like to add that I have uploaded the dynamicZone.dll file to the Libraries directory. In the second photo attached after clicking templates TUX Trading System Scalp Edition v2.01.tpl, I have only 3 indicators, do the rest of the indicators need to be added manually? Can anyone upload a picture of what this indicator window looks like ?? Picture 3 shows a dashboard with currencies, but when I click on a given currency, it doesn't switch. It is inactive, I will add that at my broker a given currency is in the form EURUSD.pro can anyone help me how to make it work ?? Please, investors, help me to set it up, because I can't handle it: (((Maybe there is a person here who would be able to help me step by step ???) I would be very grateful, because I would like to test this system Thank you very much in advance for your tips and best regards

Had a pretty bad Friday and Monday. Lost around 5 trades and got the lesson learned =) This week is going great so far. 5 more trades in progress and one just TP. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This system is great for consolidation to catch a swing (I heard that market consolidate for 80% of the time), but when it come to trending market it gets harder. However, the risk reward ratio will save you!

i'm sorry for this kind of question. after 3 years i'm resuming my forex trading.when i download mt4 and install it, it is mt5. and i'm unable to use your templates or indicator in my platform. plz give me a path to solve this problem.(sorry for my english)

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I don't use them but try FXPro - based in Cyprus. They have both MT4 and MT5 so be sure to download the MT4. Otherwise try the Australian brokers. ICMarkets have non expiring demo accounts and MT4 - Just look around for yourself. There are lots of brokers - too many really.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
It would be interesting to have an alert indicator (email, mobile notification ...) when there was a confluence of factors.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
