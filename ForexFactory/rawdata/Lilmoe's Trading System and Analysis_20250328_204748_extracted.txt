Hello traders, A month or so late, but here it is, the thread where i'm posting a full and detailed explanation of my system. sorry it took that long. but i wanted to make sure i had everything tested out, simple, and complete. I've never wrote down the rules on a piece of paper, i've had them hard coded in my brain and scattered them around on auslanco's thread for the past 6 months. I might have left out some minor points/rules, if one pops out, i'll add it to the set of rules in the first 6 posts, or add a new post with that rule. My system is split into 2 parts. 1) Intraday and short-term swings. 2) bottom and top picking (my version of buying dips and selling rallies). Notes: Please read the first 6 posts before you ask any questions. This thread is designated to discuss my system. Analysis from other systems or strategies are also welcome. The first part of my system adopts greatly from auslanco's system, and also from other systems contributed on auslanco's thread I mainly contribute to Auslanco's thread, but i will be posting here regularly. If, for any reason, you come to think that this system is useless, plz feel free NOT to use it. Constructive criticism is most welcome. on the contrary, destructive criticism is NOT welcome. I will assume that the trader has good basic understanding of technical analysis and MM techniques I will also assume that the trader has fully read and understood everything provided in babypips.com about technical analysis. Also I will assume that you have read the first 3 pages of Auslanco's system please feel free to ask any sort of question regarding my implementation and style of trading. i will try my best, during my free time, to answer all the questions and requests. This thread is not intended to be as huge as auslanco's thread, so if you're more interested in live calls from different traders, please pay more attention to his thread, as lots of traders post their live calls and analysis there. if however, u have a question about a current market signal using my strategy, feel free to post all you want. abbreviations. GJ: GBP/JPY YM: Dow Jones E-mini Futures. MM: Money Management. RR: Risk Reward. SL: Stop Loss. TP: Take profit. B/E: Break even. TF: TimeFrame TL: Trend Line UTL: Upper Trendline LTL: Lower Trendline S/R: Support/Resistance Level. Fib or Fibo: Fibonacci level FE: Fibonacci Expansion DP or DPP: daily pivot point. DR1 : daily resistance 1 DR2 : daily resistance 2 DR3 : daily resistance 3 DS1 : daily support 1 DS2 : daily support 2 DS3 : daily support 3 CD: classic Divergence HD: Hidden Divergence PA: price action div: divergence CCI: commodity channel index Gann: gann hilo activator 50ema: exponential moving average (closed) period 50. TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK. PLEASE DEMO THIS SYSTEM FOR AT LEAST 1 MONTH BEFORE TRYING IT ON A LIVE ACCOUNT.

OK, let's start with swings. What you need. Gann Hilo Activator (standard period 10) CCI (commodity channel index) period 30 MACD (5,34,9) exponential moving average period 50 (50ema) Daily pivot (for 1h and below Timeframes) Momentum indicator Simple moving average period 5 (5sma) for longs rule#1 : Price has to trade above DP. rule#2 : Price has to close above Gann. rule#3 : Price has to trade above 50ema. rule#4 : CCI (period 30) has to close above the 100 line for longs and below the -100 line for shorts. rule#5 : Price has to be at least 100 pips below a major or strong s/r - fibo level. rule#6 : Make sure a bearish HD is not visible when u make a trade. rule#7 : it is always BEST to enter at 5sma. if price is over a +50 pips above 5sma don't enter the trade, wait for it to get there, and when it does check all the rules again before making the decision WHEN price reaches 5sma. The Momentum will give a hint if price is going to retrace (pull back) to 5sma; when going long, and if price is a bit over 5sma AND momentum is pointing down, it usually means that price will have a GOOD chance of going there. rule#8 : Exit when price closes below Gann on the TF smaller to the one you're trading (so if u're trading, 1h, close ur long when price closes below m30 gann). important note : 5sma represents the REAL price. therefore waiting for 5sma to cross or at least "touch" the last condition for confirmation is better. what this means is for example, if price is alread trading above gann/50ema, and CCI above the 100 line, but price is STILL not above DP, wait for 5sma to at least touch DP, and NOT only price closing above it. this usually yeilds better results and safer entries, because you would avoid fake breakouts. you can apply the same technique on Trendline breakouts. for shorts: Vice Versa of the above. this system works 70% of the time (good RR) on ANY TF, m5 and above. i use this system to scalp on m5 and m15 TFs best TFs are m30 and 1h for intraday trading, and 4h/daily for short/medium term swings. too many rules? nahhhh, very easy rules and easy to identify. one might think there's a bunch but when u're used to them, u'll make a decision in seconds. think of it as when you first learned how to drive a manual shift; LOTS of things to concentrate on, especially when making a U-Turn, but after a while it becomes so easy that can drive and lid a cigarette while talking to your mistress on your cell phone at the same time (don't do this at home folks, it's illegal in some countries ) Take Profit and Stop Loss. intraday swings usually need a 75pip SL at least, and 2% MM. but we will discuss later how to reduce risk and use tighter SLs in my top/bottom picking strategy. an average setup should yeild at least 100-200 pips. it is always BETTER to take partial profit when you see a good S/R level in the way, and raise (or lower) ur SL accordingly. remember, this is not only a game of making money, it's a game of STAYING IN the market for a long period of time! ------------------------------------------------------------- here's an example of a m30 long trade, followed by an example of a short trade. please note that m30 is a dangerous TF (needs lots of experience), 1h should give newcomers better and more efficient signals.

Auslanco's system was what got me on my feet. that's a fact. he has all my thanks and respect. Let me tell u guys a little difference between mine and auslanco's. i had finished testing my refined system back in july. my new system is collective knowledge, i only contributed to 40% of it. what i added was the 50ema and later the concept of divergence in relation with 50ema and CCI, not as simple as determining a gann and QQE cross for a newbie, BUT the most powerful i've ever used. scrat had told me once that the combination of hidden divergence and 50ema was already there, and VERY powerful. i didn't know that there was already a system based on it, it was simply my own observation, which makes me proud conclusion: This edge of my system is designated to simply catching tops AND bottoms OF major and minor pullbacks in an established trend OR a potential major reversal. An extended implementation of buying dips and selling rallies. it filters out the "Bad" dips and rallies that lots of traders including my old self fall into. on the other hand, auslanco's system is simply catching the train of an established trend. buying dips and selling rallies were called waiting for 5sma retracements when moms were pointing in the opposite direction how cool is that? simple, but yet VERY powerful!!! HOWEVER, auslanco's system did not provide any guidlines to filter out those bad 5sma retracements or reversals (basically a trade going against you). In lots of instances back in the days, we got burned bad along with auslanco, ESPECIALLY in corrective markets. OK, Now for the fun part. Details rule #1 : CCI period 30 is our eyes and ears for trend detection. when CCI is over the 100 line on the weekly chart, the medium/long term trend is bullish . when CCI is below the -100 line on the weekly chart, the medium/long term trend is bearish . the trends stays bearish/bullish unless the other end of CCI is taken out and maintained for 1-2 weeks at least. price has to trade above 50ema for bullish confirmation, or below 50ema for bearish confirmation. something worth mentioning about CCI 30. when CCI is above the 100 line, it DOES NOT mean that price is overbought, it simply means breakout. it doesn't matter how high it gets. i will post notes if i see something "unusual". please apply the first rule to all timeframes with confirmation of the higher timeframe. the highest needed is the weekly chart, no need for monthly confirmation. rule #2 : when CCI and/or MACD detect a classic divergence while price is touching a strong SR level when CCI is below / above the -100/0/100 line (in that established trend), price tends to "seek" 50ema of that timeframe IF CCI makes it back above / below the -100/0/100 lines. classic divergence is confirmed when a trendline is broken (example in chart). a classic divergence is not necessary for this to happen, but in most cases it does. so for example, in this chart, price was below the -100 line, but while it was retracing, it made it back above the -100 line signalling a breakout and a retracement to 50ema on the weekly chart. rule #3 : when price approaches 50ema, watch for a hidden divergence. if a hidden divergence is present, price tends to bounce again and go back to it's major direction. a stronger signal is when CCI bounces from the -100/0/100 lines. if however, price makes it through 50ema, watch for the closest and most reliable S/R-fibo level. this pattern is valid unless the divergence is broken. example: take a look at that chart. the bearish HD was visible on MACD, coupled with a bounce from the 100 line. STRONG short signal, signaling a very high possibility of taking out the lows. which it did. PERFECT top picking rule #4 : in some instances when a hidden divergence forms on a Timeframe where price has already taken out 50ema, that divergence would most probably reverse price when price reaches the higher TF's Gann Line and/or 50ema. There are also instances where 50ema of the higher timeframe is not in the same direction (meaning price aready took it out too), that's when price targets the previous peak (high or low), and a bounce from there is highly probable. If by any chance the previous peak is taken out, then that would mean the hidden divergence is broken, and price is setting itself for a reversal . example, we're looking at the 1h TF, and suddenly we see a bearish HD when price is rising. if price has already taken out 1h 50ema, then the target should be 4h gann or 4h 50ema. 4 major rules. I think they're simple. something worth mentioning: I have been using this method to confirm 5sma retracements as well. i would know if (for example) a 4h 5sma retracement is due (with high probability) when momentum is pointing to the direction of 5sma AND if a lower TF is signaling a classic divergence. 4h 5sma (in this case) will hold IF 50ema of that lower timeframe (with a hidden divergence) is at the same price level of 4h 5sma. You can call this lower timeframe filtering of higher timeframe 5sma retracements. this rule applies to all timeframe, i used 4h as an examle -------------------------------------------------------------------- here's the weekly chart.

here's the same chart i showed u guys 4 posts ago for a long signal on m30 again. this one with an enhanced entry. bullish HD formed when price pulled back to 50ema. good stuff eh?? when u see me going crazy on auslanco's thread, u know i've seen a similar pattern on one of my favorite TFs (1m to 4h ). note: 1m is VERY dangerous, don't u dare trade that TF if you don't know what you're doing!! you have been warned.

Thanks for sharing, your system looks very good at first look,and I will test it on my demo accout for a while.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
no problem... this is the basic thing, but please check sunday night, early monday, i should have fixed any spelling errors or info.

The grand master has just opened his secret book... All the best... Sonic

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I have down loaded the templete and seems interesting few questions You have not specified the use of M Z What method you use for +100/-100 pip with in support and Resistance How long you are trading this system

--- 帖子 #11 ---
thanks for the flatter bro... let's try a joint effort to make this system benefit everyone

--- 帖子 #12 ---
i've been trading auslanco's system since Aug-Sep of 2007. i added 50ema 2 moths later, and the concept of HDs and CCI about 6 months ago. u used several indicator and strategies, but now i cleaned all of the "less reliable" ones out and left with what i have now. +100/-100 lines in CCI mean S/R levels of Typcial price, therefore continuation/reveral of trend, you can learn more about CCI by googling it on the web. i think u mean momentum ZL, by M Z right? momentum ZL is Que's virgion of the momentum indicator (i hope he doesn't mind me posting it here), i use that indicator to tell me whether price will or will not retrace to 5sma.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I will be in this thread so often like I can. I wrote my opinion on Auslancos thread about all of You who do such a thing like this. to You. looking forward for this thread.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
thanks for all your comments bro, and i hope u get back on your feet and trade more efficiently.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I will use the system from monday and post the results Good Luck

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Quitely learned alot from this man here by read the Aus thread (some friggin excelllent traders on that thread). I've taken bits and pieces of knowledge from them all and have developed a powerful system for myself. So noobs take heed, this is great stuff.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
thanks bro for sharing..u are nice guy .

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I mainly trade GBP/JPY, also know as the "beast" or the "sl@t", lots of traders and i call it GJ... my system works for any Currency/Commodity, but plz try it out before you go live. give urself at least a month before u get screwed..errm... i mean before u get the "hang" of how things are done i'm going to be posting lots of analysis on different pairs, including cable, euro, and UJ... also some futures including oil futures and YM.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Also worth mentioning is trading CCI Trendline breakouts. there are several instances where CCI on a given timeframe starts to form a trend line when you connect the lows or highs. when CCI breaks out of that TL price tends to comply. i will be posting live examples of CCI TL breakouts as soon as we get one.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
OK... here's daily GJ for ya. something i also love to mention are price patterns in past PA history and how they match with CCI patterns. the daily chart for GJ reflects a similar pattern we have seen back in September, where GJ hit the lowest point 2 times, and made a lower low on the 3rd try before failing to close (or maintain a close) below that point and reversing up like crazy. the reversal from 185 to 197 marked a 38.2 fibo. NOW, let's take a look here at what we got. bullish divergence on CCI, and an IDENTICAL 3 hit pattern of the lows with the 3rd hit making a lower low but failing to close below it! now now now, if we get a close above the descending green TL, u know what's up right??? daily 50ema or at least somewhere close to it. daily GJ missed 50ema by a small margin (150-200 pips) before reversing back down. now at the time when the first pattern took place in september, i predicted that CCI would start forming a TL (the green CCI TL on the left), and that shorts will be back explosively when that CCI TL is broken daily CCI closes below -100. when that TL was broken, we managed to make a new low at 166. from my own experience, when CCI fails to reach above the 0 line, and goes back below the -100 line, it's a HUGE sign of a strong bear market. same with -100 line rejections. NOW, if we DO go up this time with CCI closing over the -100 line and price starts targeting daily 50ema, im going to watch the 0 line very closely. if the 0 line is taken out, then the chances with taking out the previous lows will decrease dramatically. BUT if the 0 line wasn't taken out and CCI closes back below the -100 line, chances are that 139 will be taken out... and i'm gonna have a hard time afterwards dealing with karmo.... geez. but again here's the daily chart, i'm almost postive this will start heading up, the big grean marked area is where i predict price to head. now don't go going off on me karmo and scrat, but if we break out of that Trendline, we WILL go up that far, and maybe further up!! who knows! i'm watching this " 3 times hitting the low, with the third being the lower supported by a bullish divergence on CCI " price pattern and telling myself: "Fool me once, shame on you. But fool me twice Shame on me." you be the judge. my bias is bullish, and will remain bullish as long as the 3rd low is not taken out and/or that CCI TL holds.

very complete explanation of your system. I hope to test soon. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Lil I spotted the divergence in GU 30 minute chart see whether it is correct based on your additonal rules

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Chart now attached

--- 帖子 #24 ---
there was no divergence where you have your vertical TL that was a Valid long entry when price closed above DP and 50ema, and when CCI30 closed above the 100 line. and to get more specific, that retest of DP afterwords was held by a strong bullish hidden divergence on the m5 chart where m5's 50ema held strong and forced price back up. HOWEVER, if you notice on 1h TF of the same time on GU, u'll see that a bearish HD has formed when price was already OVER 50ema, signaling 50ema of the higher TF. check out your 4h chart, and look where price stopped great long entry, hope u guys get loads of it in the future

Word up Lil Moe! Best of luck in keeping your cave (thread) alive. Im decided to trade mostly GBP/JPY so ill pop in from time to time and will post my analysis. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
DONE Deal!! I just add it. Super!! Studying!!! marcel

--- 帖子 #27 ---
you are welcome anytime bro

--- 帖子 #28 ---
congrat, and ALL THE BEST

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Lilmoe, Wonderful, just a wonderful thing you have done by sharing this/your system with us. Thank you, you rock! Just a quick question about the MACD. I have noticed that your charts have 2 settings, 5,34,9 &amp; 12,26,9... Why? Thanks again &amp; keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Lil Very good analysis and I cross checked all the time frames. In fact I was trying to ask before the post why in 1 Hour time frame eventhoguh the price is above 50 EMA it has stopped out and now the answer. Good technical analysis

--- 帖子 #31 ---
thanks for sharing ur system i'll try it

--- 帖子 #32 ---
i got this version of MACD from scrat. he uses weird inputs, but they actually work! i switch to 12,26,9 when the market gets really choppy. and to tell ya the truth, i might stick to 12,26,9 in the near future. i'm trying to see if it get better and safer signals than 5,34,9. that chart you saw was probably one of my test templates, sorry i didn't replace it. the standard as of now is still 5,34,9. this version of MACD gives different readings than regular MACD, even if the the input is the same, and have proven to be MUCH better

--- 帖子 #33 ---
thanks bro. this should answer dozens of request i have on my PM and email. guys, this man has lots to do with my success, he's one of the best traders i've known

--- 帖子 #34 ---
i've updated some of the rules on top/bottom picking.... plz read them again carefully. i will keep on adding when an important rule pops up. i never had them written down on a piece of paper, probably should have... the ones listed are the essential parts though, and anything left out should be minor. this system is based on my personal experience, any experienced comments are very welcome.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks Lilmo for this great job. I know you are busy with your guests and trading but you did a great job. Thank you so much again Mike EDit: If anybody doesn't know what divergences are these 2 links help: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&amp;postcount=39 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=138

Moe, in your pivot points indicator,currently, the DayStartHour = 9. To achieve the same pivot as your chart, we need to know which metatrader platform u're using, so we can adjust the # appropriately.

DP values change from one platform to another, it depends on the closing time of your daily candle (which varies from one platform to another). the "daily start hour" variable in that indicator's properties should be set to 0. my platform is GMT+3 so, if you're using a demo account from IBFX you should get the same values i get if you sent your start hour variable to 3 try it out and tell me what u see. regards.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
we have a very similar pattern on cable. bullish divergence on daily chart's MACD and CCI30. a breakout of the green (thin) descending TL will signal a test of daily 50ema or close. let's see if we get a close above the -100 line next week last time we got that pattern in september, daily 50ema was around the same level as 38.2 fibo. we currently have 50ema close to 61.8. however, as we go up, 50ema might get a bit lower closer to 50% fibo. so my prediction for the coming week/weeks is cable at anywhere between 1.6 and 1.64 a break of the CCI TL downwards will signal more bearish momentum and more potential lows, and the above prediction delayed. good luck all!

Agree with the outlook for GBP/USD Posted a simple and clean chart in Igroks cave so not reposting and heres the link. Target calculated based on Igrok method. Lets see how this plays out;-)

--- 帖子 #47 ---
good stuff bro! now, let's see if we'll reach 50ema if daily 50ema is taken out, i'm expecting weekly gann at around 1.70

--- 帖子 #48 ---
lilmoe maybe you know how to change gmt+3 from gmt+0 on metatrader?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
And also EUR/USD still squeezed inside a triangle formation on the dayly and 4hr (better observed on the 4hr) with it beying inside a possible descending broadening pattern that i have drawn in sienna colour. Theres no need to talk about targets to the upside as traders who know basic oldschool TA should be well aware of. Just follow the chart and believe in your self as it tells a thousand words. And just remmembered to mention the "do not forget thang" - keep it simple ;-) My 2 pips into Lil Moes account ;-)

--- 帖子 #50 ---
nope, i have no idea how to change the entire platform's timezone, i was merely explaining how to do that on the daily pivot indicator.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Once the current UTL is taken out, the red wider range UTL is my target and i have pointed out the 1.7000 and the surrounding area which should be touched by price so its more or less the same as the weekly gann you have plotted on your chart ;-) Posting a clean chart. Cheers, P.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I am posting my first chart here on your thread, there is something I saw on GU, and realy want to share with you. Here is: Just have a look the TL on Monthly GU chart. GU Does respect those Monthly TL. As for the TOP, also for the bottom. Seams that we broke that LAST LTL on Monthly. Are we are going to have a CLOSE? it is realy question, still another week to GO.. Let's have a look the charts: Big Picture: http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-225.png And Detailed ONE: http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-224.png CONTINUE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

--- 帖子 #53 ---
How, Weekly Chart: ( I am using the same Monthly TL's) From the the very top @ 2.116 The PA stopped on the Monthly UTL (just have a look all that rally we had before followed by your CCI 30 bearish Divergance [item 8]. Now Follow: 2. Breakout 3. Test the breakout 4. Another Breakout 5. Another test. 6. Another Breakout 7. and test.. (every TL is followed with retracement, penetration and Retest) Now the question is: ARE WE THERE YET ?? I don't know, but what we are having is weekly close bellow that Monthly LTD, and if we are still there, we can go only down to test the low @1.367 from 6 November 2001. Chart: http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-226.png CONTINUE &gt;&gt;&gt; .....

--- 帖子 #54 ---
very interesting indeed bro i'v been watching that TL back when cable was touching it. i also remember saying we might see cable at around 1.3x area. HOWEVER, we do need a monthly close below that TL. (check out my previous post about cable on this thread, there's a green TL on top of the price, THAT is the same TL you're talking about we need to close below that TL and it acting as resistance in the coming weeks for that breach to be confirmed, just like u said. but before that happens, i expect a major pullback. let's wait and see

--- 帖子 #55 ---
sweet i like it when things start to line up. all we need now is confirmation. are you enjoying your weekend so far bro?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Yes had a relaxing and peacefull day. Got back home and did my homework for the upcomming week, and posted a few charts @ your thread. Its 2:23 @ night down here so im finishing some of my drawings and packing to bed. Hows your weekend so far buddy?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
woww.. One of the master at FF Thanks lilmoe.., i hope i can learn a lot from you

--- 帖子 #58 ---
i have smth another

--- 帖子 #59 ---
always be careful not to overleverage your trades. this market is at a critical point right now and as of this point, price can still go either way. a breach of the daily descending trendline should be our confirmation of a short/medium term reversal.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
OK, Daily: ... few observations: [Those Monthly TL are rock solid S/R] Everytime cable touch th LTL, we are seeing the FIBO 0.382 retracement1 [1 &amp; 2] and [6 &amp; 7] http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-227.png http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-228.png

--- 帖子 #61 ---
welcome back bro... it's 4am here, and i'll be going for a nap. looking forward to see your charts. take care, and see you later

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Sorry mate, for so many charts I posted, but cable is a KEY factor for GY. So, my point is: 1. everytime we touch the TL, we bounce (retrace FIBO 0.382) 2. last retracement was when we touched the last TL [9] 3. we penetrated the LTD, and retested, (honestly I am expecting the maybe another retest on the TL (now UTL), but no more 4. we are also on FE 1.618, and from EW point of view we are not DONE, not YET. 5. the trendline which is acting as a resistance on Daily chart from start of wave 3 has been tested almost evey candle, but I trust the Monthly TL more then on daily. 6. As per EW point also, there is still some space to move to downside, so the levels I posted here is not impossible. - they are expected CONCLUSION: the market can go everywhere and everytime, the time is now very dangerous, all levels are broken, and we can expect anytime some intervention or something else, MM is the key in this game. It is YOUR EXIT making a money into your account NOT your ENTRIES !! So I am expecting some more move to downside, maybe retest the LOW from Nov.2001 [8], and aslo I can see that Bullish Divergances are building UP, But also I have to SAY that when ever I can see a reversal SIgnal, I am going to LONG this CABLE.. http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-229.png

Since Moe uses FXDD. It uses GMT+3. I'm going to list the mt4 platform brokers here. A) FXDD, FXPro , Straighthold, Best Direct ==&gt; uses GMT+3 Set DayStartHour = 0 B) Alpari (Russia,UK,US) , MIGfx, Broco, InvestTechFx ==&gt; uses GMT+2 Set DayStartHour = 1 C) didn't mention IBFX (don't like it) but it uses GMT+0 ODL also GMT+0 Set DayStartHour = 3

Here is my daily chart...I don't have a lot of time to explain my fib but I think she will hit the lower T1 @ 1.2954 after a possible inner retrace. I have the gann hilo and the 50ema shown. I thought it was interesting that price hit gann hilo and two of my inner fibs perfectly at the same time. We will see what happens.

you're most welcome bro. sorry it took me that long to start this thread explaining my system in an organized matter. i do have most of these points scattered around in auslanco's thread. but i think it should be easier for everyone now that they are organized. don't hesitate to ask anything u want about my system, it will be my pleasure to make everything clear enough for everyone!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
i see u made that post seconds before i posted i was going to sleep, looool. i should've waited 5 more minutes before leaving. but that's ok, it's the weekend lovely charts you have there, and they DO make sense. however, we do need confirmation, and just like you said bro, we are at key levels right now, and price can STILL choose to go either way. where ever it will go, let's try to make sure we're on the right side of the market with good targets

--- 帖子 #68 ---
yep, 50ema and gann are always in confluence with fibs and s/r 90% of the time. i need to pay more attention to your charts, cuz as of now you've been pretty accurate EVEN after a while. same goes with piters. IF i get proper confirmation for more downside, i will join you guys in bear camp. but, i'll stick to what i see right now, and will look forward to add to my longs thanks for your posts big guy, i really hope i get LOTS of them here

--- 帖子 #69 ---
very possible bro, i like the looks of your charts

--- 帖子 #70 ---
ok everyone, i have a theory i want to share. i want u guys to look at the charts back on friday the 10th of october when we first hit 166. look very closely to the patter we had. the bias at that time was pretty bearish, and everyone was loading shorts. i was one of those stubborn fellas that believed in a bounced and that 166 was a bottom. on that very same day, we had a rally that started in asian session and ended when the euro session was closed. NY dragged the price down for a 61.8 fib retracement of that rally. LATER before NY close, price RALLIED exactly like we did 2 days ago (friday). same pattern don't u think? if we do get an exact pattern, i'm expecting a 150-300 pip gap at market open. then the market should retrace back to close the gap and go even lower than the closing price on friday. Afterwords, we should see my anticipated 1500-2000 pip rally starting late asian session for 2-3 days. yes i'm expecting lots of bulls monday through wednesday and maybe thursday, with late thursday and friday being retracement or sideways markets. let's wait and see.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hello Lilmoe, Like I studied till late last night many advices from Your charts..I have a question towards to Your approach of opening position. In some posts, You open position according 5Min chart then You wait how 15Min chart react and then 30Min chart...am I correct??? Mostly what I see is that You open 2 trades, one You let run lets say 50 pips and etc..., second You put SL at BE if it reveerse?? ( started to do it as well, but many times when I opened 2 positions got hammered) open 1 trade, position made it dammm.. Thanks so far to You..and others...have a great rest of the day..here we are getting first snow in Slovakia and it is really cold..wish to be somewhere in Carribean..

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Absolutely ...what an observation..a lot of room for me to learn...

--- 帖子 #73 ---
haha, snow is nice we don't get that here until late december, it's 17 degrees, and the weather is wonderful. like i said in previous posts on auslanco's thread. when i have confirmation of m30 and above TFs, if i'm not already i the market, i try to get the best possible entry. i do that by relying on the m15 and m5 timeframes. just like my system works for higher TFs it works really good at lower TFs (1m chart included). hope that helps. i will, however, be posting regularly here. and i'll make some live calls following my system to make things more clear. till then i'll be happy to answer or clarify anything you don't understand

Moe, According to your specs, we now see a hidden bearish div on 15 min chart, is it right (see chart)? Even though the CCI is above 100 and looks like an ideal case to enter long based on hourly chart. I think we should wait till it pulls back a bit before entering long. If yes on hidden div on 15 min, we shouldn't take the trade and how low should you think it might go? 50 ema or Gann level? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
hey there MK, how's everything? actually, there wasnt any hidden divergence there. to get a hidden bearish divergence, we had to have a lower high on price and higher high on MACD (that's the definition of bearish HD, the opposite of classic divergence). in this particular instance, we had a CCI TL formed on the m15 chart, and was broken, CCI also closed above the 0 line (the level it was under before the CCI TL is broken, u have to have a CCI level broken in order for the TL break to be confirmed). in most casses of a CCI TL break upwards, if CCI was already below the 0 line, we need a close above it, and if it was already over the 0 line before the break, then confirmation would be a close ABOVE the 100 line. Also, if CCI was below the -100 line before the break, then we'll need a close above -100 line... hope that makes sense a long entry would've been in the blue shaded area. hope this helps.

Gotcha .. thanks man ..

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi Limlo, I was wondering what was your reason at that time for being bullish? Were you using this system or you had another reason? I put a chart here , We were getting lower high in the price(H1 TF) and somekind of higher low in MACD but I am not sure. Please advise. Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #82 ---
other than 50ema and gann, i trade fibs and more importantly FEs (fibo expansions). below is a daily chart where i placed an FE from 215-184-197 (high, low, lower high). FE 100 was 166 to the dot. there was a bullish divergence on the 4h chart coupled with a breach of an ascending trendline. FE 100 with a bullish Div was my reason to change my bias, the breach of the trendline was my unltimate confirmation. what's the target afterwords? that's right 50ema oh!!! but 50ema on the 4h chart was taken out afterwords, so what does rule 4 of my top/bottom picking strategy say?? that's right gann of the higher TF or 50ema... check out the daily chart and look where it stopped charts&gt;&gt;&gt; Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Lilmoe - thanks for starting an interesting thread - I'll look at your methodology asap - sleep and FO/LO come first http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif @ Pieters - nice analysis, especially the pick up on a bounce with a fibo retrace to bring in fresh sellers to push and finally break the support.. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif as I commented in the other thread, so far I dont see the Swissy confirming a sustained rally in cable &amp; euro. The main driver so far has been the rally in UJ up 2.75% off its low vs cable only up 0.94% @ Belekas - Hi, whilst I do see your 1.6671 target in cable, lol what happened to all the fibo's that we worked on . http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif .....I'll only get converted to that target once we break the 38, 50 and 61 levels - not that I wont be long on the way.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif G Nite all - till FO....may the pips be with you.... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon6.gif

--- 帖子 #84 ---
some spelling and grammar mistakes... here's the correct version rule #4 : in some instances when a hidden divergence has formed on a Timeframe and does not stop at 50ema but goes higher, price usually reverses back when it reaches the higher TF's Gann Line and/or 50ema. -- sorry, i was probably in a hurry when i wrote that, and now i can't edit that post

--- 帖子 #85 ---
hey there big guy thanks for your comments. sleep well

--- 帖子 #86 ---
If you contact FF Admin they let you to do that.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi Islander. I dropped the fibo thing long time ago because it didnt work out for me. I got introduced to oldschool TA by one really good trader in ff, whos name i wont disclose. I also came across Igrok method and his thread on the forum on his book. I started drawing my lines. Now my lines make sense to me and i fully believe them, because at the end its all that ive got. I trade with minimum indicators, just trendlines and sometimes horizontal S&amp;R lines. Also just MACD to point out the minimum "must reach" targets when a pottential divergence is confirmed. If you went thru my profile, you saw that my favourite book is written by Mr. Toshchakov ala Igrok. It opened my eyesand im gratefull to the author. I trade patterns including channels, triangles, wedges, pennants,h&amp;s, etc and my favourite - diamonds Also added pitchforks to my toolbox, as they work really good under such market conditions as now and back in the day during the great depresion in 1923 when Dr. Alan Andrews developed a channeling techniq and came up with really huge income. I believe forex is geometry so those lines make sense to me as well. But nevertheless i keep a 1m/5m charts for GBP/JPY with pivots, sweetspots and a few ema's on.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi, i am over 4 years in forex trading and i think your system can produce nice pips.I am only confused about one thing.Can you explain HD (hidden divergence),this is first time i ever heard about that and i am long in trading. Classic definition of divergence would be : When the price of an asset and an indicator, index or other related asset move in opposite directions. In technical analysis, traders make transaction decisions by identifying situations of divergence, where the price of a stock and a set of relevant indicators, such as the money flow index (MFI), are moving in opposite directions. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictio...divergence.gif http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictionary/2.gif In technical analysis, divergence is considered either positive or negative, both of which are signals of major shifts in the direction of the price. Positive divergence occurs when the price of a security makes a new low while the indicator starts to climb upward. Negative divergence happens when the price of the security makes a new high, but the indicator fails to do the same and instead closes lower than the previous high. So what is the trick with HD,for me it is not a divergence when MACD make new high and price is not making new high. My question ,to be more specific is,how reliable is HD.If we asume clasic divergence can be used with S/R levels often but how often can we trust HD? For me this HD situation would tell me that price can brake S/R if MACD is in front of price at least until now. So is it true if i say we should take entry on S/R what ever divergence occurs because one have to occur,classic or HD. Confusing ? I am sorry if i spammed this tread but i was really surprised to see this HD theory for the first time after years of trading. good luck

here's a good link Mike has posted in this thread, check it out. also you can go to babypips.com and read their explanation of hidden divergence. here's a quick link: http://www.babypips.com/school/hidden_divergence.html

Rejection of the 0 line, now heading down to test -100 with 4H GANN [140.076].. interesting

--- 帖子 #91 ---
watch the ascending TL on 1h chart. price's target was ascending LTL. how was your weekend btw bro?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
YEP, we are there, I was hopping that we touch the 4H GAnn, but even if we break that LTD, we are still bouncing of the 4H Gann [140.08] Yes, thank you for you Question, very nice, summer is here, beach, sun, ect... lots of outdoor activities durring the day, and trading over the night..

--- 帖子 #93 ---
hah! winter is just starting here.... (cold )

--- 帖子 #94 ---
It is my previous post on AUS thread, but I posted here as a sample! hmm, according to lilmoe, when we are approaching 50ema [2] on 1H and 0 line on CCI 30 [1], then if we are having a rejection like we had [1], the price action goes down to retest the next support [3], in our case DPP, LTD, and 4H GANN @ 140.07 http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-232.png

--- 帖子 #95 ---
testing the DPP (red candle) with CCI on -100 level, and rejaction, implicating retest the Resistance levels on other side, this time ema 50 and above, gann 1H http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-234.png

yes, my friend, it is an excelent TOOL, gives you an EARLY warrning Sign.. before tcunami lool thanks for that, I saw the setups, I posted here for all other members, because it is a good example .. what you are talking ABOUT.. GOOD STUFF mate (as usual)

--- 帖子 #98 ---
and we are having another one now, with 1H Gann level and again, fight with 0 line @ CCI30

--- 帖子 #99 ---
no problem. market is relatively slow right now. when things start moving faster, setups will be more obvious. take a look at the 1m chart, and look where price bounced

--- 帖子 #100 ---
please note everyone, that DP is most likely miscalculated on mondays. better readings should be provided from your brokers' website or from more reliable feeds like e-signal. i hope piters can help us with that on mondays

--- 帖子 #102 ---
here's another example (too bad i didn't take it because of bad broker feed)... bullish HD on m5 when price was touching 50ema and failing to go below CCI's 0 line. partial profit would be taken at m5's gann for 45 pips, and SL would be a bit lower than m15 gann (second target if m5's 50ema was taken out) around 35 pips. first TP of 45 pips has already been reached while i typed this. second target is FE 61.8 at 143.55 provided we close above m5's gann. same rules apply to higher TFs of course...

Hi Lilmoe, Well I have been watching the Aus thread since Feb 2008. You guys ( all of you ) have been an inspiration. Many thanks indeed and you have led me to post at last. I am still quiet new to forex really, went live in Feb and am over B/E which is ok for me as I feel I am still learning my way. So, I attached a chart and wondered if you could check I am looking at this right. 5min chart shows bullish HD and price bounced from 50ema and near 0 CCI. Could have taken a long here with 1st target 5min gann, good place to exit half and move SL to BE. Gann did not hold, so next traget would be 100 CCI or the peak @ 143.21 perhaps. These all broke, so were moving up higher to see if 100 CCI holds on 30mins and 1hr, then next target 143.71 peak. If these all break then we are looking for 50ema on the 4hr chart ? Thanks for any comments. Also at this stage 30mins method could come into force, if price closes above 100CCI, as price is above DP, 50ema, Gann and sma is above 5sma etc etc

--- 帖子 #104 ---
hahaha, I read your previous post, you must have added it as I was typing

--- 帖子 #105 ---
your potential entry and targets are all perfect. now THAT's what i call great understand of my system great job bro, and keep up the good work!! welcome to the club

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thanks man, I think I may have just had a "eureka" moment - hehe

--- 帖子 #107 ---
not that i advise you to start trading the 1m chart (it's a bit risky for one who has just started to trade my system) m5 should be the lowest TF you go. BUT, take a look at your 1m chart where the last dip yielded a bullish HD WHEN price was BELOW 1m 50ema. rule#4 of bottom/top picking states that price should revers back when it touches gann or 50ema of the higher TF. so that means that it should reverse from 5m gann or 5m 50ema. it DID. your entry would've been 5m gann, and your stop loss would be a bit below 5m 50ema in that particular case, tagetting the previous peak or the day's high for at least 50 pips hope it makes sense. and NO, i don't think you should start trading 1m now, give urself a bit of time to fully have a grasp of my system

--- 帖子 #108 ---
i've been asked several times to post auslanco's indicators. here then are for those interested. the only one i don't use regularly is QQE. the rest are on the first page of this thread. 1) gann hilo activator 2) momentum ZL 3) QQE

--- 帖子 #109 ---
target was reached at 143.55, where price bounced a bit. a close above that and we're getting a FE100 at 144.21 ) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I already close long at 142.36 for 100pips now.. wait for the fresh entry, suggest me the best place to buy thanks

--- 帖子 #111 ---
So possible long entry soon off 30mins. Price is closing above 100CCI, Gann, DP, 50ema etc. Poss retrace closer too 5sma for an entry. Good target would be 4hr 50ema

--- 帖子 #112 ---
yes, but take note that 4h 50ema is very close, so is daily gann (currently less than a 100 pips away). m30 and 1h long signals should be at least 100 pips away from strong s/r levels as rule#5 states of my swing trade system keeping the longs we had from lower levels at b/e SL is the best thing to do atm. but if we do get a good dip before those levels are reach with a bullish HD visible on a smaller TF like m15, then yes, we'll go ahead with another long

--- 帖子 #113 ---
let me thing about it.., thanks buddy

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Just gotta break thru the old TL which is now acting as resistance, just my thoughts

--- 帖子 #115 ---
missed by a small number of pips, we might go back up in a bit to touch that level and go back for a dip. something else to take not. we have a bearish gartley pattern (bearish Bat) forming on the 1h and lower charts, BUT 1h and m30 CCI are over the 100 line. very small chance for this to start going down, but it's interesting that the bat formed right when we almost touched 4h 50ema don't rush into longs at this level just yet.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Respect for your effort wanting to share your system to make us all a better trader. Whenever i am "ready" i will shurely contribute to your system. Whishing everyone lots of happy trading and good (L)earning.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks, I forgot that rule - lol I updated my chart above, this could also cause some problems

--- 帖子 #118 ---
i will not be taking this m30 long signal. to risky when we've reached an upper TL of a rising wedge, with classic bearish divergence forming on 1h. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #119 ---
please post chart that showing Bearish bat Thanks Lilmoe

--- 帖子 #120 ---
u're most welcome bro

--- 帖子 #121 ---
here u go Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
no problem. i know it's exciting to see a trade signal. but one must not forget to go by all the rules. you will usually have lots of time before making a decision to take a trade, and before u do, it's' not a bad idea to by all the rules first i tried a small short at the open of this m30 candle. reasons are like is stated before, bearish div on 1h when price is touching upper TL of rising wedge. edit: 144 is a 61.8 fibo of the fall from 147.80 to 137.70 we might go down from here back to 50% at 142.80, or even back to 141.60 (38.2 fib)

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Lilmoe, Are there any extra things you look for say in a trendline breakout, to filter false breaks etc. I was thinking perhaps waiting for the next CCI level to be broken ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #124 ---
i try to make sure that when a trendline is broken, a hidden divergence isn't present. and even better confirmed with a CCI breakout of a level or a CCI TL. at the moment, i THINK we might be heading to the lower TL of the rising wedge. if we take out the lower TL, i'll most whether i think it's a false or true breakout

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks, so here's what I see on my chart right now as a poss - 1hr chart - price bounced off UTL, and also a possible bounce on the CCI TL. Chart is also showing possibly regular bearish div. Also poss bounce off 50 ema on 4hr Confirmation could be a close below 5min 50ema which is also around the same price as 15min Gann ?? However, the issue here is target which would only be around 45 pips ( 50 ema 15mins or Gann on 30 mins ) Just throwing some thoughts around, but as you say above they don't really meet the rules.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
the way you drew that TL on CCI is also correct. i think i mentioned that somewhere on auslanco's thread, but when a bearish Div appears on MACD but CCI has higher highs (like the one we have now), try to draw a TL on all peaks (which u did), and if the meet, then the bearish div is valid what i'm also observing is a potential bullish HD on m5 and m15 charts, that would mean we'll most probably bounce back up from 3 possible targets, which are m5's 50ema, m15's gann, or m15's 50ema. i like m15's 50ema a bit better if i'm going to load longs again because it's in confluence with 50% fibo of the fall from 147.70 to 137.50. just like i mentioned in my earlier post. however, i've been around GJ for quite a bit of time, and i think it will make attempt to retest the upper TL of the rising wedge, and MAYBE go 20-30 pips above it. it's a classic technique of shaking out shorts. i think it might go to 144.2x or even 144.5x before it heads back down having said that, this sucker may chose to do whatever it wants.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
didn't even finish saying that

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi Lilmo, When we say waitting for a close above 50ema in H4 TF , M15 close is enough or we should wait for H1 or may be H4 close above it? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #129 ---
it's always best to wait for a particular TF to close above its own 50ema so yes, it's better to wait for 4h to close above 50ema, and buy dips afterwords if u're not already long.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Good job on the thread lilmoe! I've been trading his system (30m and 1h TFs) long before he officially posted it here and its proven amazing results. You're an amazing trader

Hi Lil I got only short time to trade but was able to collect +70 pip using Time frame 5 and used time frame 1 to exit

--- 帖子 #133 ---
lilmoe 12,26,9 setting is the same settings as for popular OSMA Oscillator. The base for most oscillator indicators out there which show divergences is OSMA ... Just if you didn't know

Thanks Lilmoe, will practice this on my demo . Good stuff

--- 帖子 #135 ---
gotcha i'm pretty used to 5.34.9, it'll take me a bit to get used to the standard settings. but i'm workin on it i might change a bit in the rules here and there. thanks for the comment bro!

great job bro! hope it'll always work as good for ya you're welcome and good luck!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
OK Lilmo, I haven't been long so far and my H4 candle is closing in 5 Min. Would you please tell me what is the best strategy now to get in the train? Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Mike, I was wondering the same. I was looking at now 4hr closed above 50ema we look to lower TF for retracement to 5sma for possible longs ? I'll let Lilmoe give you the "real" answer though - lol

--- 帖子 #139 ---
a 1h 5sma retracement might be due. 1h 5sma in good confluence with m5's 50ema, it would be a good opportunity to add more longs there with minimum SL if we get a bullish HD on m5

--- 帖子 #140 ---
that's going to be a 1h 5sma retracement, IF, we get a good bullish HD on m5, because m5's 50ema is what's in confluence with that

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I was looking at your top and bottom picking again. Am I seeing something on the daily chart ? Classic bullish diverg, price looks to be breaking back thru -100, trendline break. So, price should seek daily 50ema if I'm not mistaken ?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
u bet ur a$$ u're not mistaken daily 50ema should be the ultimate target

--- 帖子 #143 ---
At last it's dropping.Buy order on 5ema H1 Could we call this HD in M5???

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Is 5mins showing a poss bullish HD, off 50ema and poss bounce off the CCI 0 level ? Also ties in with a 1hr retracement to 5sma

--- 帖子 #145 ---
is the daily 50ema around 159.40?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yeah, around 160 ish for me

--- 帖子 #147 ---
yep, bullish HD. i'm expecting it to hit 50ema on the 5m chart. if it doesn't hit 50ema, and price doesn't rally really fast, AND slowly closes above gann, i'll add a long that's a minor rule i forgot to post, i'll do that whenever i get permission to edit the posts on the first page of this thread

--- 帖子 #148 ---
WOW - I played this as price was also holding on the 15mins Gann and CCI was dancing off the 15mins CCI 100 too. 120 pips - Lilmoe, what can I say, some great pips today

--- 帖子 #149 ---
hope u got that one crispin

--- 帖子 #150 ---
see? making 500 pips a day in a market like this is not that hard is it?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
yep, that's a bullish HD sorry i didn't see ur post, it played out nicely.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
something i said 3 days ago. charts don't lie NOW, Daily TL is broken is officially broken, and we should be heading higher towards 50% fibo (@ 151.42 or 61.8 at 154.66) at the least tuesday (today). CCI30 is well above the -100 line, so yes, that's a true breakout i believe we should retrace a bit for now, and MAYBE we might retest that broken TL back at 144-145 before another push upwards. Attached Image (click to enlarge) m15 and m30 have been rising in an ascending line without a single break since 141.60. there's already a bearish divergence present on those charts which might yield 50ema if that TL is broken. stop m30 50ema. which are is a potential target to add more longs. we have 2 MACD bottoms on m15 with the first at 141.60 and the second one when price dipped to 145.86, this means that the low of 145.86 should be taken out for a bullish HD on m15 to be valid (if we retrace from here). m15 50ema is already below that level as of now, which gives it a SMALLER chance to HOLD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) HOWEVER, we have only 1 bottom on m30's MACD, which makes a bullish HD valid even if price dipped as low as 141.60 (but not taking it out. i think reach there is hardly possible at the moment) m30 50ema SHOULD hold, and i believe it will hold. i'll be looking to add more longs from there. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #160 ---
plan: i will try to buy m15 50ema (in confluence with 1h gann), with a tight SL. if it doesn't work then i'll try m30 50ema with a wider SL

Hi Lilmoe Should we do any setting change in daily pivot. In the input coloumn the start time is zero Should I change anything

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Go to a few pages back, post # 63. There you can found the setting of DP.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi Limoe, So for me now I see a possible bullish HD on 30mins and 1hr. Would be best to enter when 1hr closes above Gann and then poss wait for 5sms retrace if needed ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #164 ---
there is no 1 and only correct setting for DP, however, look 5 pages back, you should see all the settings i personally use for DP. hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
yes, if u didn't buy m30's 50ema, it's much better to wait for a close above 1h gann, you can either buy a 1h 5sma retracement afterwords, or wait for a dip on the m5 chart where 50ema holds

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Took a small long based off 5mins bullish Div and TL break, also close above 5mins Gann. 1st target would be 5mins 50ema / DP. 1hr showing bullish HD too

--- 帖子 #167 ---
that's right, but there was another short off of m30 gann, because a bearish HD was present on m15 where price was a bit over 50ema (rule#4 states that price should reverse from gann of the higher TF, which in that case was m30 gann) hope u got that short too, m15's CCI also bounced from the 0 line... it might take a bit to get the hang of all TFs, but when u get there u'll be good

--- 帖子 #168 ---
OK, well I sort of got that. I took the short based on 5 and 15mins bearish HD and a close below 50ema and DP... I guess I missed the rule part, but it worked out well anyway.... It's slowly fitting into place, sure it'll take a while but I am already "seeing" the charts much better

--- 帖子 #169 ---
great, now here's another one the bearish HD on m15 played out so that price made it a bit below 1h 50ema (again rule4) where price almost touched the higher TF (4h), and BOUNCED from there activating the bullish HD on 1h. our 1st target should be an fe 61.8 at around 147.70, and ultimately FE100 at 150.14 IF we close above 147.70 hope that also makes sense too bad i missed that long entry because i thought it would go down a bit further to actually touch 4h gann. but it missed by a few pips

--- 帖子 #170 ---
lol - I missed that last one you posted.... However: I saw bullish divg off 15 and 30mins bullish HD on 1hr 30minsand 1hr Gann, ema50, DP close above I got in around 146.05 I think, bit late but great still

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi Lilmo, Try 21 EMA close in these situations.More accurate than Gann.Bounce of 21 is base of Phillip Nell system . Mike

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Bro I am SHORT from the TOP.. looking for the BOTOM

--- 帖子 #174 ---
closed for 120p I'll reenter on that bounce

--- 帖子 #175 ---
great job bro

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Lilmo, Are you long from 50 ema M5?Also bounce of 0 in CCI Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi Mike, I took a small long @ 145.88 ish - off 5mins bullish HD and bounce off 50ema and CCI 0. Target 5min Gann area. Closed now for 70 pips

--- 帖子 #178 ---
will look at that, thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
yep, and already closed it for 80 pips hope u got that one bro! it was a good scalp

--- 帖子 #181 ---
aren't u on fire today bro!!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Crispin apply your system very well, I should do that..! Lilmoe.. what is your bias now, is it still Long bias?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
last couple of days, I am like making a MILLIONS BTW, GU is on monthly TL ( retesting, penetrated and now testing again) and DR1 UY is on DS1 temp bounce but still down

--- 帖子 #184 ---
hey, it's not hard at all just keep watching it for a while before u make any trades, and try to confirm ur entries with me. and after u get a grasp of it, u can go on alone

--- 帖子 #185 ---
WOW - nice indeed Piters, fair play to you my friend

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thanks man, it's opened my eyes up so much to what is on the charts. I've made more pips in 2 days than I would normally hope for in 2 weeks. Amazing - still getting a feel for it, but it's a good start indeed.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
since we've successfully closed above 1h gann, bias is still long (unlike piters ) but this still can go either way. bullish HD on the 1h chart worked out well, i didn't get the bottom, but it's all good even i don't get every move, so there's no reason you should, get what u can, and try to go for the easiest and more obvious ones. i AM worried about that 1h pinbar though, it might dictate the next direction (down), i'll wait for a close below 1h gann first.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thanks Lilmoe, I apreciate it I still have much time to learn

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Same here, following every letter written

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Great...

--- 帖子 #191 ---
by the way, i'm short off m5 gann with a bearish HD on 1m chart and price over 50ema (rule4 again)

--- 帖子 #192 ---
closed 1/2 for 50 pips rest at b/e

--- 帖子 #193 ---
closed the rest for 20...

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Guys, What is TL, you keep making referece to it but I can't find it on the abbreviations on your first post. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Trend Line

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Trendline i added it to the list of abbreviations

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Dear lilmoe bro What is the trend as per you bro? I have both shorts and longs shorts at 146.5 and long at 147.5. What should be targets for both as per you? Thanks bro in advance and god bless Balaji

--- 帖子 #198 ---
hala to tell ya the truth, this is a crazy market. my bias is still long of course, unless we close below 4h gann. i believe we might test 148 again and maybe above in a few hours, but that's not for sure. everyone else is thinking shorts... i'm sorry to hear u're stuck, let's wait and see.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Dear bro lilmoe Thanks a lot for ur reply bro. I too think it is going to be range bound market for some time without clear breakouts. I am thinking of putting 151 for the long and 142 for the shorts. Is it good as per your just your opinion bro balaji

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi Lilmo, I was reading your posts from the beginning.I came across to this post. As you see price is closing above TL , Gann , -100 CCI Line and we have Bullish divergence . So as you say in your post we should expect price to go around 50 ema in daily TF. Am I right? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #201 ---
yes, you're correct. usually when we have a breakout after a bullish divergence, 50ema of that particular timeframe should be the target. we also have a close above daily gann

--- 帖子 #202 ---
i would start shorting this down if we break below 141.60 downwards, otherwise i still believe this is going up. if u think GJ is a bit hard to trade bro, try cable.... i'm going to buy all cable dips till we get to 1.65

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Anyone see the bullish HD on 15mins with a close above Gann and CCI ?? Also a valid 30min long signal

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Ha Ha +150 gy TF 5 minute waiting in TF 1 for exit

--- 帖子 #205 ---
we're still less than 100 pips away from a strong s/r level at 148 wait for it to close above there and go long after a valid pullback

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Damm, forgot that rule again - lol Thanks

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Is the attached chart a valid signal? Checked the 1H TF and CCI is above 100 but pointing down. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #208 ---
For me on this trade, 5,15 and 30mins were all showing bearish divergence - plus the 30 min reversal candle. Was great for 50+ pips

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Thanks to Lilmoe I was able to generate +300 Pip using time frame 5 minutes and exit based on time frame 1 Minute CCI 30 is a great tool for executing the trade. Next week I am going live buy using small value contracts

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Excellent, well done. Great week for me too using this method and it's only Tue.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
sorry i was away... it wasn't a valid signal nor an entry, because we were close to a strong level of resistance. and even if we were not close, ur entry was a bit late. u should enter when u first get the signal, not 3 candles later...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
great job bro more green pips to all!

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi moe I'm new here but has been lurking around at aus thread for months until you've decided to post your strategy, it really helps alot into understand the system by reading your thead. Anyay I got a curious question here, do you consider those daily r1,r2..s1,s2..etc to be a good s/r you've mention earlier? Or a s/r line created physically by looking at prices to be more importance?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
welcome to the thread that's a very good question indeed, and something that has been on my mind lately. before this fall started back above 200, GJ used to respect these levels more frequently. however, after those massive selloffs and retracements, we see them respected less frequently. this is due to major moves being more dominant and stronger. either way, i would personally advise using fibo expansions and fibo retracement levels. those have rendered better results. if, however, a manually drawn s/r level is in confluence with a pivot level, it would make it stronger and more worthy of your attention. hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
forgot to note that the daily pivot point is most certainly a VERY strong S/R level, and it will always be different platforms have different daily candle closing times. therefore the pivot point can differ significantly. most of the time, it should be close. most of the time, the difference is minimum when it comes to calculating the daily pivot, HOWEVER, daily support and resistance may very by a far margin, that's due to he way it's calculated. so, let's say that ur platform's daily pivot differs from mine by 5 pips, our daily s1 might have a 30-40 pip difference. that makes the daily pivot more reliable. hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks it helps greatly, It bugs me abit when daily s/r lines doesnt quite matches the PA, thanks for explaining on that. I havent got a hang on fibo though, those I've drawn myself dont always tally with the experts here thus denting my confidence abit on it abit, still learning. Road leading me to green pips I hope XD

--- 帖子 #217 ---
i would really suggest picking a book off the shelf about fibos. true, plotting them might be a bit confusing for a newcomer, but it will get easier by time.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Lilmoe, take a look at 15M, do you think it have to ready to short (for scalp)? and check 5M thanks EDIT: ooopss.. lucky i didnt take that short, should learn more

--- 帖子 #219 ---
post me a chart where u thought there might be one...

--- 帖子 #220 ---
at that time, was like this chart..

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Your trading style is admirable mate. Always wondered how you could pick those tops and bottoms so consistently. Well... now I know I have put your systems into 2 pdf files so it's easy to print. Hope it's ok with you. Cheers for sharing your secrets bud

--- 帖子 #222 ---
well, if it's on the web for free, i don't see why it's not ok for it to be on pdf, lol thanks for that bro

--- 帖子 #223 ---
rule#5 on my swing trading system says to make sure there's no visible bearish HD if u're trying to go long, OR a bullish HD when u're trying to go short. take a look at that m15 chart, there was a strong bullish HD, which was still valid even though price was below 50ema. so that automatically marks that trade as bad (no entry). check out the fourth post on the first page of this thread, u'll see other examples of bad trades.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yea, I sorta figured that. But ya know what can happen when you ass/u/me something

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Sorry for the silly question...but, can you post the chart showing the "strong bullish HD"... I dont see it. Also, check out this daily chart ... looks like a potential buy signal to me on the daily... what do you think? Does this retrace to the daily 50ema? Also trying to break the daily gann. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hello Lilmoe Thank you for the previous responce. I'm still trying to get the hang of this system. In the chart attached, if the CCI breaks the -100 and price retraces back to the 5sma will that be a valid short entry? For exit do we wait till price breaks through the Gann on this time frame (M30) or on a lower one? I'm really sorry if you've answered these questions before, I have read through your thread but I'm not sure if Im understanding it correct. Thank you for all your help,

--- 帖子 #227 ---
yes it should ultimately seek 50ema give or take a couple hundred pips. check out page 2 or 3 of this thread, i talked about that daily setup over the weekend. here's the bullish HD i was telling him about..... i suggest reading more about hidden divergence. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #228 ---
hi, that wasn't a correct way to draw a TL on CCI. you should connect peaks/bottoms together. as i did on the daily chart (marking the divergence), but it doesn't necessarily have to be a divergence for a TL to be there... when you get an M30 signal, the signal is always confirmed as long as price is above m30 gann. however, when you first enter, you can get an early exit when the lower TF m15 closes below gann (notice that this doesn't mean it would close below m30 gann). if the m30 signal is not valid, you can reenter when m15 GIVES YOU A SIGNAL. meaning that all the rules should apply on m15 for a reentry IF m30 was still above gann. hope that makes sense. edit: by the way, we STILL don't have an m30 signal as of now, the -100 line keeps getting rejected.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Good Morning lilmoe

--- 帖子 #230 ---
morning pipchick

--- 帖子 #231 ---
GM Lilmoe, Is the signal on 15mins a valid long - I see no HD. Also price closed above Gann on 30mins, 1hr etc. Also poss reg bullish div on 15min chart Poss retrace to 5sma due

--- 帖子 #232 ---
was thinking the same here.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I took that trade Crispin, how about you? Hope we didn'f forget anything

--- 帖子 #234 ---
morning crispin, my DP is at 146.74 which is acting as resistance at the moment, i'd wait for a good close above that and 5sma to cross that level and u're correct, it would be a valid signal afterwords.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
on ibfx, we are already above dp (now i see that)... wait for 5sma to cross that level before going long, i'll do the same with a stop below m30 50ema

--- 帖子 #236 ---
keep ur stop below m30 50ema. it acted as good resistance all asia, it should be good support now...

--- 帖子 #237 ---
guys, on m15 and lower TFs, it's always better to wait for the real price (5sma) to cross an s/r level or a trendline. this way u'll know that the breakout is not false. it's more like price crossing that level on the line chart. this condition is listed below the set of rules i have for my swing trade system.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yep, my DP is at 146.52 and I was waiting for 5sma to catch up. All seems ok now.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
ok, long at 146.62 (u guys probably got a better entry), 65 pip stop m15 5sma just crossed dp on the ibfx platform. first TP at 147.50 and second at 148.20

--- 帖子 #240 ---
here's a link for some good material on divergence for anyone interested. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...9&amp;d=1227692220 thanks sogt725

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Thanks, my entry was at 146.72

--- 帖子 #242 ---
it seems like the DP i have on my platform is holding price from going up. that's a good example of why i should wait for price to close above all DPs of all Platforms, looool....

--- 帖子 #243 ---
DP on mine is 146.55 FXDD.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
yep... looks tough. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #245 ---
i attached a chart, check it out.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
ok thanks will do, might it be a good idea to put SL a bit below Gann since Gann tends to act as support?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
i put mine 15 pips below m30 50ema, it all depends on the size of your trade, and how much u're willing to risk...

--- 帖子 #248 ---
yep, sounds ok to me.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I need to. Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #250 ---
i posted a link 3 or 4 posts back with some materials on divergence, check it out.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
that was a long scalp off of m15 50ema with a bullish HD on m5 and price a bit below m5 50ema.... anyone got it? edit: target was m15 5sma, and m1 50ema, 30 pip scalp.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I saw it, but did not trade it, was thinking we'd need to see a close at least above 5min 50ema/DP ?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
long from 5m 50 ema with bullish HD, 50 pip stop

--- 帖子 #254 ---
no no, no need for that when the conditions are met. the bullish HD was still valid even when we're below 50ema on the 5m chart. the rule states that price should reverse when it touches the higher TF's gann line. which it did i took profit on that one at the confluence of 1m 50ema and 15m 5sma, because there was a bearish HD on 1m... not only does hidden divergence and 50ema give u a signal to enter, it also gives u a signal to exit. and the bearish HD on 1m was my signal to exit that long scalp, or at least take partial profit... makes sense?? by the way, i'm cutting my loss on that 15m long swing signal, i'll wait for a better setup. note: when the market is "Trending" 15m and below swing signals are more reliable than in a ranging market like this one

--- 帖子 #255 ---
i know i'm overloading u guys with info, but it's for the best i've worked so hard on filtering bad signals. i'll create a word document listing all the rules and conditions again in a more complete manner

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Lilmoe, can we use this strategy on EY too?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Didn't even look at the 1m chart Was expecting the 5m bullish HD to at least test DP again. Out for +10. Watch the price go up to DP now I'm out Will wait for price to close above DP or hit 1hr 50ema

--- 帖子 #259 ---
test it out for a couple of days before hand... this system works BEST for cable and GJ. i don't ee why it shouldn't work for EJ

--- 帖子 #260 ---
if u have multiple screens, it's always best to keep all TFs open in small windows, once u get used to it, it'll become really easy to look at all of them in a glimps

--- 帖子 #261 ---
i believe the bullish HD on m5 didn't play out yet...

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Lilmoe, that divergence stuff is great. I did studied it on babypips several times..great, but this is a little advanced. Another thing is that I was afraid of last night Divergence when we reached 148,50 and that one worked good till now. Todaz I opened one trade so far, I close it, scalping for me too risky NOW. Very boring..today I do not know what are we waiting..I believe again for NY.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Looks like we're getting it on the 15m too. Is that bearish HD on the daily? Price hit daily gann too with a hanging man candle

--- 帖子 #264 ---
stopped out on that 15m long.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Most definitely pound weakness since EY is staying put.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
yes, very risky indeed, we're in a tight range atm, it's best to wait for a breakout.... no more scalps here before a breakout. range is just too tight.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
gu wants 1h 50ema which is in good confluence with 4h 50ema... i'll try a long there with a 50 pip stop... if i get stopped i'll wait.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
+35 pip time frame 5 Thanks Lilmoe

--- 帖子 #269 ---
ok, that bullish HD is playing out now on the 5m, it bounced from 1h 50ema. was hard to get i guess. didn't get it myself. and yes, a bearish HD is forming on the daily chart, but that would take some time to materialize. price may and should go as high as daily 50ema though... it wouldn't go that high in one shot, it might be a sloppy uptrend. however, looking for longer term shorts if we reach there is a VERY good idea

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Lilmoe, I'm still having trouble with the above statement, perhaps it's just me being dumb....haha I'm reading that a 4hr 5sma retracement will occur and remain valid for an entry long when mom is pointing to the 5sma and a lower TF is showing classic diverg. But... you also say that if the 50ema of that lower TF with hidden diverg... That's saying that the lower TF will have both types of diverg Maybe I'm reading it wrong

--- 帖子 #271 ---
long from 1hr 50ema, half off at 15m 50ema, stop moved to +20 EDIT: Should have TP at 15m 50ema, didn't see the bearish HD on the 1m

--- 帖子 #272 ---
that made me laugh, hehehe ok, i'll try to make things a bit more clear with a small scenario: let's say that 4h close above gann, and we're in an uptrend. price rises high and then closes above 5sma (normal behavior of an uptrend).... the new 4h candle opens and the new momentum is pointing down, signaling a 4h 5sma retracement. ok, so far so good... we take a look at m15 (for example), and to our surprise, we find a classic bearish divergence has formed, sweet. there's also an ascending trendline that has formed on m15 and was broken (bearish divergence confirmed), this would confirm a retracement to 4h 5sma. so far so good again... we later take a look at m15 50ema, and to our bigger surprise, it's at the same level of 4h 5sma! wow, our short scalp target is 15m 50ema obvious and it gets hit (cool). surprise again!! when m15 50ema was hit a strong bullish hidden divergence had formed on the m15 chart right when 4h 5sma has finished its retracement: we add more longs to hour swing trade position at 15m 50ema (which is also 4h 5sma). that's basicly how we add postions to our longer term swing trades, combining trend confirmation with buying retracements, short for saying buying those dips till our long term target is reached ------------------ so far, the current 4h uptrend has been really lousy, and it's subject to retracement at any time now (i don't believe so yet, unless we close below 4h gann and 1h 50ema)... but in a normal (cleaner looking uptrend), buying those 4h 5sma retracements (coinciding with lower timeframe bullish HDs at 50ema) is a really nice way of adding to your position. the past drops after those 1000 - 1500 pip rallies since september were very good exampls of how you would add to your short position from the highs till the targets at lower levels were reached (that's the opposite of the bullish scenario earlier in this post)... does this make better sense? plz don't feel embarrassed if there's something still not clear. i want u guys to fully understand this as it's VERY powerful in growing your account and profiting from a trade 5-10 folds. i've used it since late july, and i've doubled my account so many times with VERY minimum risk. i would love to see u guys do the same.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Yes I need to do that. Forgot about the bullish HD on the 5/15m. Should have moved the last stop to BE, now I'm missing green pips

--- 帖子 #274 ---
dang, are u stopped out already??

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Cheers Lilmoe, I'll read thru this a few times and watch it on the charts. Getting there for sure

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yea bud, hit my stop at 145.81 then shot off again I'm going to go steal the mrs' 21" screen and get my old 17" outta the shed. 3 of the suckers should so the trick. I see very clearly how you work now lilmoe. Ingenious stuff mate.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
take a look at it again, i drew a line where i went back to examine the current scenario on 4h. don't want u to confuse it with the (make believe) scenario i had above it.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
great, but i would suggest keeping that old monitor of urs and going for a multiple monitor setup, would look better

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yea mate, 2 x 21" screens and an old 17" all running at once. Have a spare graphics card round here too. Will need to Google multiple monitors I guess, can't be as easy as just hooking em all up. I read this a while back somewhere on here, boy does it apply to your system: "Think of each singular time frame as a musical note, when we combine multiple time frame’s together we go from the market blaring out one note noises, to the market singing us a melody and revealing the message"

--- 帖子 #280 ---
ok, here's another form of setup that we MIGHT get. CCI on the 1h chart has formed two tops, one lower than the other when price had a double top at around 148, try connecting those tops and u'll get the descending trendline on CCI (we'll call the that CCI TL), that's obviously a classic bearish divergence. if we break below the PRICE trendline then we're looking for either a 50% or a 61.8% fibo retracement (downwards). we should confirm that break with a CCI close below the -100 line (or m30 CCI below -100 line, but 1h is a bit safer), for a the retracement to reach targets. HOWEVER, if we bounce UP from here, and CCI forms another top, wait for it to actually TOUCH the CCI TL again. in lots of instances, that's a short off a good S/R level. IF, however, price continues going up and CCI closes ABOVE that TL, we're up for more bullish action and should target higher highs after another dip does this make sense everyone? here's the chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #281 ---
How true is that after playing with this sytem, this week... Great quote

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi Lilmoe, great post I printed it out and stick it on the wall in front of me I'm just confusing a bit about one thing: "classic bearish divergence", I think you mean here "classic bullish divergence" (bear signal), because in babypips.com there is no "clasic bearish divergence" they have "bullish divergence" and "bearish convergence", so I think people call "bullish divergence" as "bearish divergence" as it's a bear signal, but they are the same, am I right? do you understand what I mean?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
just did bro no trades here other than the remaining longs from the lows... i'll close another portion of them if we close below 4h gann no more scalps here till we get a clear breakout...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Yep, all clear - is that fib placed from the low of 137.66 to the high 147.97 ish ?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
no no no, there's a bearish and a bullish classic divergence. bullish div is when price is going down and about to reverse up (buy signal) and bearish div is when price is going up and about to reverse down (sell signal)... don't get confused between the two, it doesn't matter what baby pips call it, there are 2 times of classic div and 2 types of hidden div

--- 帖子 #286 ---
regular (classic) bullish diverg = UP regular (classic) bearish diverg = Down hidden bullish diverg = UP hidden bearish diverg = Down Does that help ?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
yep here's the chart updated (sorry forgot to place the fibs ) that scenario is good provided we do get a breakout. and since 4h gann is so close, let's wait for a 4h close below gann Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I was thinking the same too, as 4hr and 1hr Gann and 50ema's got to break yet.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
also, check out how many time m30 CCI bounced from the -100 line...

--- 帖子 #290 ---
ok, if m30 closes below 4h 50ema, it's a valid m30 signal with a 65% success rate. again, it's also better to wait for a 4h close below 50ema. we can sell lower TF pullbacks afterwords.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Lilmo, I was going to go short when H1 Gann changed but as you see in my chart we have HL in price and LL in CCI which is HD bullish divergence but MACD doesn't show LL. What should we do in this situation? I put the black arrow for the entry and TL's are in black too Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #292 ---
i don't use CCI for confirming hidden divergence, i use MACD for that, and since MACD doesn't show then it's not i use CCI for classic divergence and trend confirmation.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
m30 candle close, this would have been a nice m30 short swing signal if it wasn't for price kissing 4h 50ema... m30 CCI is below the -100 line if u guys were short from the top, good job

--- 帖子 #294 ---
by the way, just as promised, i long GU at the open of this 1h candle (close enough to 1h 50ema) with a stop of 60 pips. bullish HD on 1h, and price close to 50ema hope u guys got that one. i THINK this will surprise everyone and reverse GJ upwards lol.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
closed a 1/3 for 40 pips rest at same SL..

--- 帖子 #296 ---
+25 LONG on time frame 5 minute based on botom picking. Seen some divergence in time frame 5 minute can you check whether I was correct for that entry

--- 帖子 #297 ---
thanks, got it

--- 帖子 #298 ---
made the same one hope u ran with ur profit though!! it's a bit risky now.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY WE SHOULD SHORT SUPPORT BAD SHORT SIGNAL, PRICE WAS VERY CLOSE TO 4H 50EMA cable on the other hand was a long, cable goes up, GJ goes up... simple as that.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
OK - I took the bounce on 30mins chart off 38% fib. 30mins also showed bullish diverg, then 5mins went back above Gann and CCI 100. 100pips now with trailing 50 SL now. 1hr candle forming piercing line pattern which will help push it higher if it holds. Close above 30min Gann and 50ema will be great. 4hr candle body also now coming back into the LTL with a strong 4hr reversal candle forming too

--- 帖子 #301 ---
wonderful job!!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Thanks - Price closed above 15min and 30min 50ema but... Big sandwich now between: 15 min and 30min 50ema, 30min and 1hr Gann Gann and DP Also the LTL that was support is now resistance Breakout time soon !!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I closed for 105 pips - Reason: possible bearish HD on 5min chart which also has the previous TL above it and also a desending trendline on the highs (5mins) Done

--- 帖子 #304 ---
wow! someone's been doing their homework!!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
taking some time here, always been a bad student at school

--- 帖子 #306 ---
if i can do it, u can it'll take a bit, but u'll get there

--- 帖子 #307 ---
surely, will study it more during the weekend . Just got the got to be a bit faster in spotting the divergences and all. Or I might just be a chart retard

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Yep it takes time. What I did to start with was print the 4 pictures of divergence from babypips and stuck them next to my scrn. Worked a treat !!!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I'm gonna start printing and hang it around me, stick it around my screens . Gonna watch CSI Miami be back in a while.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Took a small short off 5min bearish divergence that bounced off DP and the previously broken LTL, now acting as resistance. 70 pips http://www.forexfactory.com/images/misc/progress.gif

--- 帖子 #311 ---
hahahaha, aren't u excited.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
i took that long off 5m gann with a bullish HD on 1m

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Am I every - lol, 460 pips in 3 days. what's more it's in a real shitty range too What can I say, thanks for sharing. I just gotta keep reading it over and over.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
ok got new wallpaper, pictures of divergences hanging around

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Took another long off 5min bullish HD. Bounce from 15min Gann and 5min bounced off CCI 100 60 pips

--- 帖子 #316 ---
ok guys, i'm taking a break now.... be back after an hour one this 4h bar closes.

--- 帖子 #317 ---

Thanks Lil yes that is what I am doing get in and get out asap +100 pip a day is enough for me

--- 帖子 #321 ---
hey lilmoe, how are you? just saw this thread .. congratulations bro!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hey people, I have created an indi for this system which just helps me quickly look-up values for CCI, Gann, 50ema and 5sma. It's NOT meant to replace the actual indicators, it was only made to quickly look at the current values so I did not have to hover my mouse over the indicator and wait for the tooltip to pop-up. The CCI does show its value in the indicator window, I have added it here just for quick reference. Here are the settings: LabelPosition = The position of the label objects (0=top-left, 1=top-right, 2=bottom-left, 3=bottom-right) 1 and 3 work best, any other position and you'll have to play with the offset values below. TopOffset = The offset in pixels of the top or bottom of the label (depending on the LabelPosition above). LeftOffset = The offset in pixels of the left label (indicator name) RightOffset = The offset in pixels of the right label (indicator value) TextColor = Color of the font FontSize = Size of the font DrawAsBG = Draw labels as the background ShowCCI = Show the CCI value CCIPeriod = Same as the CCI indicator CCIPeriod ShowGann = Show the Gann value GannLB = Same as the Gann Lookback setting GannFile = This is the name of the gann ex4 file in your "experts/indicators" folder (without the .ex4 extension). The default is "Gann_HiLo_Activator_v2" - so you'll need this from lilmoe's templates. If you have another gann indicator that you would like to use, just enter the name of the file here (without the .ex4 extension). ShowSMA = Show the SMA value SMAPeriod = The SMA period (default is 5) ShowEMA = Show the EMA value EMAPeriod = The EMA period (default is 50) BarShift = The bar to calculate the values from. The two settings you'll use are: 0 = the current bar 1 = the previous bar This value cannot be under 0 or above the total bars in your chart (I assume 1 and 0 will be the only two values of use anyway). It seems to work best with the default settings and "chart shift" set to on.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Just poppin' in to say hello. Hows going Lil M?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Glad you're finding the indi useful, sure saves time having all the info there at a quick glance. Looking at this 15m bullish HD, will look to enter on the 15m 50ema with a stop below the 30m 50ema. At this rate, she may take a while to get there

everything's great bro thanks for stopping by

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hey people, I found a bug in Que's Gann_HiLo_Activator_v2, it wasn't flipping correctly on some bars. See my posts: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...stcount=144098 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...stcount=144123 I have made one myself, exactly like Que's but it now flips on the right bar. I have changed the lilmoe.mq4 indi to use this new gann instead. You can just change the GannFile setting to "Gann_HiLo" in the original (make sure you put the new gann file Gann_HiLo.mq4 in your experts/indicators folder )

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hey! Which trading platform are you using. Because I use Tradeport, which is licenced platform of Saxo bank's platform, which has not have Gann Hillo Activator. Tnx.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Lilmoe, As you pointed out, my 5min gann system is so similar to yours, that I have now implemented the macd divergence, cci etc. So, i'm essentially trading your system now. (divergences...doh!) Question: do you use macd for divergence only? Would you, for example, enter a long while the macd is still on the downside?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I want u or anyone else to help check this hidden bearish divergence on the daily tf chart of cable(gbp/usd). I will be glad if the responce is faster. Thanks

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Looks like hidden bearish div to me too. Anyone else, please weigh in.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
hey there, sorry, i JUST logged in... was out all night and just came back home there are many oscillators/indicators you can use for spotting divergence. i personally use the provided version of MACD, it gives better and early signals for both classic and hidden divergence. i use CCI30, however, only for classic divergence because it doesn't work that great for hidden divergence (or as per my own experience, i could be wrong). hidden divergence is the complete opposite of classic divergence. it basically means that price is "rushing" towards OB levels in a bear trend retracement, or rushing towards OS levels in a bullish trend retracement (according to the TF of course). CCI 30 (and that's for period 30 alone) breakouts over/below the 100/-100 line dont necessarily mean OB/OS levels, it simply means that price has "borken out" a level that would be considered either a reversal or a continuation of the previous trend. hope that makes sense

--- 帖子 #348 ---
hey there, sorry again for the late reply, i got your PM yes, that's absolutely what it looks like. it's a hidden divergence, and it's a bearish one to be exact. the usual target of the bullish divergence prior that one, which led to that recent upmove, was 50ema. HOWEVER, 50ema is far from being reached at the moment. which keeps me wondering. we MIGHT range for another while until 50ema gets closer, SPIKE up there, and reverse the very same day. OR, we might head down from now. the daily reading of cable's MACD (in your chart) is very high (or - overbought in other terms); the very definition of hidden bearish divergence. we have seen a VERY similar instance where the same has happened before price reached anywhere close to 50ema; and that is on cable's (GU's) 4h chart. where cable ranged for a good while when it reached 1.52 on the 24th while retracing from its low of 1.45. at that instance, cable ranged for about 12 4h candles before spiking up and hitting 50ema (The same happend with GJ) and reversing from there to make new lows. this is just an observation, it's not a rule. i'm basing my prediction on previous behavior (history). the rest is up to price of course, which can prove me wrong.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
It made sense after the 4th read lol. For some reason I am having trouble wrapping my brain around divergences..I can spot them, but still using a cheat sheet with pictures. Thanks for the response!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Bullish HD on 15m, Price broke above gann, Broke CCI 0 Valid Long?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
lol, i'm glad it finally did. divergence might seem a bit easy at first, but mastering it is a VERY powerful add-on to your system. this IS how i filtered out bad trades from my strategy. My observation of the relationship between divergence and 50ema came as mere coincidence, call it luck. lol. i suggest reading more advanced topics about divergence. KNOWING what it means can also add to your skill and help you better understand how the PA really works. i've seen lots of traders on auslanco's thread make terrible mistakes in trades because they didn't have a good feel of divergence. believe me, it HELPS.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
now this is a bit strange, my platformed started ticking 1 hour and 20 mins ago. but i still don't see the same divergence u're talking about. i even switched to the same MACD settings as urs.... here's a small bit of advice, DON'T trade the first setup u get on sunday's market open, they are usually BAD trades caused by even the smallest gaps, especially on m30 and below TFs. here's how my chart looks like. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #353 ---
yea that is weird.. Thanks for the advice, will be looking forward to post more charts in the future and asking for more of your advice =)

--- 帖子 #354 ---
no problem big guy... i've been "fooled" by lots of first setups when market opens after the weekend. trade well!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi Lilmo, Hope you had a nice weekend. I was wondering could we call this Bullish HD? Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #356 ---
hey mike, yep my weekend was great thank for asking. yep, that sure is a bullish HD, and since it formed when price was below m15 50ema AND m30 gann, then we should reverse when we touch 1h gann according to my system. and that's close to 146.20 this is the 1st setup on my chart after market open (it's probably the 2nd on some of urs), i don't usually take first setups on market open after a weekend, it's just a small precaution.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
we use mt4. i'm not sure if our indicators are available for your platform. you might want to consider charting my system on a mt4 platform, while placing your trades on saxo bank's.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
actually, i HAVE, seen that bug LOTS of times before, but it's nice to have someone who actually fixed it for us thanks bro

--- 帖子 #359 ---
No probs bud. Not sure how it would have affected things in the long run, but I guess it's gotta make some difference. Even if it's an earlier entry or exit, it all adds up to pips, green or red

--- 帖子 #360 ---
i concur

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Thanks Lilmo, Sorry, I don't get what do you mean by" then we should reverse when we touch 1h gann according to my system. and that's close to 146.20 " Do you mean If we got a bounce of H1 Gann then we long?if yes you wait for closing of H1 candle? I don't get it really. Thank you again Mike

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hey lilmoe, is that a bullish divergence forming on h4, just above 50 ema, would this be a good entry long from your rules???

--- 帖子 #363 ---
we should've bounced from 1h gann, u should go long when we touch it but like i said, it's the beginning of the week, and the first signals are usually bad.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
well it's kinda hard to say the latest low we had was 139 on the 4h chart, we were kinda ranging afterwords, so i'm not sure about that setup. normally yes, it would be a good long off 50ema.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Thanks Lilmo, As you said when we are getting to 50 ema here in M5 ,we should look for Div. Here I found a Bearish Classic Div.So I expected a bounce from 50 ema. It Happened Is my observation right? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #366 ---
that was a bearish HD, FOLLOWED by a classic div. STRONG signal, and ur observation was great but since it's a 5m chart, don't expect 100+ pips get half closed with u get 40 or a little more.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I see we have a close below 4hr gann, still has the 50ema to break yet. Might look at a short from the 4hr 5sma, it has confluence (give or take 9-10 pips) with the 15m, 30m and 1hr 50 ema

--- 帖子 #368 ---
You may notice that this gann hilo does not flip and carry on with the most recent/current bar. This is because it does not care about this bar as it has not closed yet. We're only concerned with the prior bar that has closed.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Is this a good short? Bearish hd, expect bounce from CCI 0. I'm still not quite sure when to trade divergences when I see them.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
cool, i see that

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hey lilmoe, when you get multiple divergences on multiple timeframes, how do you know which to trade?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
smaller first, but the higher ones ultimately play out.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi guys, I made about 80 pips trading the hidden bearish divergence i saw on cable,close 90% of my trade will let the remaining 10% run,I also observe now that we are about getting to short gj on 1 hr tf,the fisrt support that has been holding it is about been broken. What will u say Lilmoe.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Am presently short on gj,1 hr tf,will wnyone confirm the entry?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
bro, I replied to you on my thread. c'ya @ london Open

--- 帖子 #376 ---
guys, what we had on the 4h chart wasn't a bullish HD. hidden divergence forms after a retracement of a particular TF's trend. 4h was ranging for a while, so and the previous MACD low was when price was at 139... not 144.60.... the REAL bullish HD just started to form. and it DID when price is currently below 4h gann. this gives us 2 possibilities of this to play out. 1) daily gann at 142.60 2) 61.8 retracement at 141.70 and yes, i'm planning to buy at these levels

--- 帖子 #377 ---
no bullish divergence on 1m or 5m... we ARE currently about to form a bearish HD on the 1m chart, where another bounce from 1m 50ema (downwards) is possible, in other words: continuation.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
GM lilmoe, OK I took bearish HD off 5mins with close below Gann and CCI 100 @ 145.56 ish (7:50) Rode it down about 130 pips and closed when we got to daily Gann Great start to the week

--- 帖子 #379 ---
good job big guy! as usual! i took the last one when price touched m15 gann

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Friend, I can boldly say that ur system works more than 70% u proclaimed,I made a hell lots of pips just today trading ur system on my live trading account.I will advise everyone not to trade live account directly like me as i grab what the system is about early enof,thanks to the experience. Lilmoe,u really are a genius Good work there,i like ur system big time Guyz i might be done for the day,meet my target and even went beyond it.Men i made cool dollars...........lol Lilmoe,we need to talk ooooooooo,i really thank u

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Great thanks Lilmoe.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
no problem bro... as long as we're all making pips

--- 帖子 #383 ---
This pair keep on inviting me,but am done already.Keep on going down for my people...............lol

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I was gonna call it a day too, but as I've said before..If it's giving out pips I'll take 'em.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Possible long op soon with bullish div on 5mins, possible bounce around 61% which is also around daily Gann. Push lower would form the bullish HD off 4hr too.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
don't get greedy!! if u reached ur daily target pack ur things and go home!!! remember, greed = not good

--- 帖子 #387 ---
wait for the bearish HD on 1m to go first. by the way, the last m30 signal was 100% valid. target was daily gann

--- 帖子 #388 ---
ok, gone, i'm long at 142 with a 40 pip stop. a bit risky, but the bullish div on m5 and the new momentum on 1h are signaling a retracement to 1h 5sma which is in close confluence with 5m 50ema

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Looks like G/U hasn't found a bottom yet..might drag your trade down a bit. I'm still short only on G/U.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
darn... stopped out...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
That was a lil' NUTS!.. (I don't mean to laugh, I'm sure your account will survive ) *still holding g/u short with a 15 pip trailer.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hey lilmoe, What you looking at now ?? I see bearish HD on 5mins - 15min CCI bouncing along -100 - 30mins CCI trendline could be broken to the upside, wait for close, same set-up on 1hr CCI trendline coming too But bullish HD on 4hr forming. So little confused at the moment

--- 帖子 #394 ---
this bear was pretty strong. i still think the bullish HD on 4h has to play out. if not reversing this, it should at least provide a good bounce. let's wait for more confirmation

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Cool, what would you look for to confirm a 4hr bullish HD here ? Close above 30mins Gann ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #396 ---
for better confirmation, we're looking for a close above 1h gann m30 aint bad either for starters. BUT!!!! it doesn't mean this will go straight up if the 4h hd is confirmed.... bearish hd's on 1h and m30 might start to form. hard to follow up sometimes, right?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Lilmo, I saw HD bearish in M15 following breaking ascending triangle. I took a short but then I noticed price hasn't closed below -100 in CCI. So now I am praying Edit:My praying worked out!! Mike

--- 帖子 #398 ---
lol. the setup was correct... but i'm personally a bit chicken of short those levels, especially when 1h and below TFs are highly oversold.... good job by the way

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Kinda sitting on the side waiting now.. Hoping a break in the UTL on 15mins will confirm bullish div. Close above 15mins Gann would be nice, hopefully to start the 4hr bullish HD

--- 帖子 #400 ---
since this has went too far down.... the only hope we have is for 137.70 to hold. if that gives way, the bullish HD on the 4h chart is broken! and rallies should be shorted. otherwise, we could have a very nice reversal from there don't only stick to the long side bro. try selling those bearish HDs too... lots of pips to be made

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Yes indeed, your correct. My only concern is finding a good place to short after such a massive move down already. Not really seen anything to make me jump back in today - nothing that jumped out at me anyway How I should have held onto my short at 145.56 this morning -- lol

--- 帖子 #402 ---
lol, that's ok bro... that's why i always keep some at b/e profit. even if it's a very small portion of your original trade. it's small but it adds up i didn't see any good pullback to any 50ema except on the 1m chart.. didn't take much out of them though.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
we almost have a 15m breakout. a close above m15 gann and CCI30 above -100 line, and m15 50ema is on the cards a good reshort might be from there. but plz make sure the bearish HD is still there when u make that short. a bearish HD is form on the m5 chart too. i'll try adding shorts at m5 50ema first

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Lilmoe, Quick question for you about Divergence, on the 5 TF or i guess anytime frame really. What would you define as an acceptable divergence indication in terms of # of candles? Secondly, when you say watch to see how it plays out, is there a specific # of candles you would look at to say yes its confirmed or no its not? with-in 2-3 candles? or if its not on the very next candle its a fake out? Thanks

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi Mike, Please can you post the FX Divergence indicator you use? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Its all there on page 1 bro.. clear as mud, actually 1 of the best system descriptions put together here i think

--- 帖子 #407 ---
morning folks hope u guys caught that short off 5m 50ema

--- 帖子 #408 ---
i don't really use a # of candles. there are, however, certain levels that price need to close over/under for a divergence to play out... it's all listed in the guidelines i have in the first page of this thread. review the guidelines (rules) and watch some of the examples we have. it should make things a bit more clear.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Morning Bro, Valid short entry on the 30mins, retrace to 5sma would be good... However, I'm just unsure it's safe to short at these levels, what do you think ?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
yes, it's a valid m30 signal. but we're in major lows... and i'm thinking 136 is good support as it's a lower TL of a 4h broadening top... but i do think we might get there. the best entry short was the last 5m 50ema with bearish HD. but i did go ahead and added a VERY small short...

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Looks like 5mins also has another bearish HD forming now too. So a bounce off 50ema would be good and does that also tie into a bounce off upper TF's Gann ?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
yep, bad place to short when we're so close to major levels... that's why it's always better to wait... i'll wait more for this trade to go through, but if things don't look promising i'll bail out on it.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
We wait, and we are going to see your OLD friend playing Ping Pong, for a hour-two, and building a Bearish DIV on 1H.. lool... not bad for a start BTW, EW suggesting Bottom, for a while [suggested levels on down side are 137.05 - 137.70]. possible retrace to 144-148 area.. stay tuned

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Dear Lilmoe, Thanks for the a good system. However for a newbie or rather inexperienced trader like me, difficult to pick divergence, any reference or link to pick up different type of divergence. Thanks in advance. rajat.ind

Dear Lilmoe, In the chart below we can expect a trend revesal from divergence point of view. Thanks for the links, trying to learn from you and is much obliged. Regards rajat.ind

--- 帖子 #420 ---
not a trend reversal, it means we'll retrace upwards back to 30m 50ema

--- 帖子 #421 ---
bullish div target reached might bounce down from here.

Dear Lilmoe, What in your opinion is a trend reversal signal. Regards rajat.ind

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Is anyone presently short on cable and gbp/jpy? Could the rejection on the daily pivot prove any form of retracement?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
If i may get to know what u are saying,are u confirming that the uptrend might continue? 'Cos i think the divergence shows on the 5m tf will indicate a change in the direction of the market for a while,if am wrong please explain with chart. Thanks.

a daily close above 141.50 and a bounce from the daily cci -100 line

--- 帖子 #428 ---
there was a bullish Div on m30, it took price straight to THAT div's target which was m30 50ema... but now we're a bit over that and VERY close to 1h 50ema.... we should bounce down from there as there is a bearish HD on the 1h chart now.

great job bro!, i made that entry too

Hey, How would you pick a good entry now ? 1hr HD bearish div, would you wait for 30mins Gann at least ?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Dear Lilmoe, i meant in terms of indicators and strategy. I want learn to fish ..... I hope you can understand. Regards rajat.ind

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Thanks bro, Took the short on the divergence,lloking good for now.But took it with a small lot though.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
+47 PIP GET IN AND GET OUT liL My target is met

--- 帖子 #435 ---
CCI 30 at 100 or -100 is the same as price penetrating 30 period bollinger bands up or down. If you want to get rid of the indicator lines, you might want to use bollinger bands..

--- 帖子 #436 ---
sorry i wasn't around, just saw ur question. with a bearish HD on 1h, i went short a bit close to 1h 50ema. no need to wait for m30 gann... just short when price touches 50ema. 38.2 fibo of the last fall held it 50 pips from 1h 50ema, but that's close enough. anyway, after we bounced from 1h 50ema, we also had a 15m bullish HD, where a good long would be at 15m 50ema. both played nicely, and i'm 55 pips plus on that long and closed 2/3 of the short for 140 pips it's not like u to ask about such easy setups, what's wrong bro?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
yeah I know mate, I got a little cut-up in yesterdays mess and I think I'm doubting everything I do now... I missed the short above, but I took the long, but I entered on the bounce of the upper TF Gann - I think that's the correct way to do it, isn't it ?? Anyway it was approx the same price as the 15min 50ema anyway. Just wanna check I'm working it right... Sure I'll get back into it.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
lol, it's ok... a mess like yesterday's was hard to catch.. don't believe those who claim they caught the entire thing... when things get messy on a small TF always look at bigger Tfs and yes, ur entry was correct, and i hope u took some partial profit

--- 帖子 #439 ---
bro, i really suggest reading the first page of this thread again...

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Lilmoe, sorry for disturbing you,i want u to please confirm if what i have here is a bullish divergence the 15m chart. Thanks

--- 帖子 #441 ---
If we enter trades using divergence on lower tf,what should be our exit point? I discover divergence don't play long in the lower tf. Thanks for the response.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
it is when MACD is set for 12.26.9, but for 5.34.9 so i would consider that a week classic bullish div. but it still can play out. but what u're actually seeing here is a bullish HD as well. as long as we don't go lower, this could play out for more upside. and for better confirmation, if we close above m15 gann, we could see 140.55 as a first target, then 142 as a second target. but i'm worried, however, about this close below 1h gann...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Bearish HD on 5min chart, good short of 50ema which is also bounce from UTF Gann

--- 帖子 #444 ---
yep, target should be m5 gann... not very rewarding though as a first TP. but i took that trade anyway

--- 帖子 #445 ---
hehe sweet... What do u make for 30 mins thou, it's showing a bullish HD with a possible invert H&amp;S forming. If you have 2 TF's showing HD in the opposite direction, I assume the higher TF is always stronger ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Will u advise to change my macd to 5.34.9? Or is it this setting that u use on a lower tf

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I dont see the HD? How about a chart, lol, so i can see it. I shorted off the 50ema bounce anyway, closed it out for 40 pips. Thanks

--- 帖子 #448 ---
yes but the lower TF plays out first, and in that case, make ur TPs and SLs minimum. by the way, target reached for that bearish HD on m5. we just hit m5 gann. i took half off there, rest at b/e easy 40 pips there. hope u got it. now if we close ABOVE m15 gann, i think we're up for more targets upwards.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Sure, sorry - it's not always easy for me to post charts in the office.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Thanks Crispin, that makes perfect sense to me now

--- 帖子 #451 ---
this is very much up to u. in the matter of fact, u don't need the same MACD indicator i use at all. if u have an indicator that u prefer, there's no problem in using that, stochastics work as well... i use that setting myself because i found it a bit more rewarding. but 12.26.9 is a bit "safer" as some would say.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Yep, I got the 40 too.. Close above 15mins Gann ? I guess your seeing the bullish HD there same as 30 mins.. So, question - in this case when we have bullish HD and we don't have a higher TF Gann to bounce off - it's best to wait a close above that TF's Gann/50ema ( 15mins in this case right now ) ?? cheers buddy Edit... sorry I guess we bounce the "lower" TF Gann as it's the reverse

--- 帖子 #453 ---
well, those are very rare cases, and when we do here are the possibilities. 1) 50% - 61.8 fibo 2) if we missed that or got stopped out for any reason here are some other resorts: a) if it forms a double bottom (in the case of bullish HD) we take the trade again with minimum stop loss b) we wait for the lower TF to close above gann AND 50ema 3) the targets would be a bit different (double bottoms are an exception). and in the case of a bullish HD it's called a 1-2-3 (or abcd) buy setup. and sell setup for a bearish HD of course. possible targets are: 1) FE 61.8 2) FE 100. do u know how to place FEs on your chart?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I was thinking all the same idea, the HD on the 30 min, PA is above the 5SMA, and a bit below the Gann &amp; 50ema, and ofc the daily pivot is a ways off and the CCI is round 0 On the 15 TF, its just crossing the 50EMA. and above Gann &amp; 5sma, CCI is again round 0. So under these conditions, neither set of conditions for the two sets of rules are met. So would you let it play out and just wait till all the conditions are met?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
So in this case now where we have the 30 mins bullish HD, yep I see that close above 15mins Gann and 50 ema make sense. Not really tried FE's, just the usualy fib pulling

--- 帖子 #456 ---
here's a chart showing the FE setup: we also have a broken trendline (green), do u see it? again, we have a bullish HD on m30, we didn't have a 50ema to go long at, nor a higher TF gann.. so it means we need a close below the lower TF gann (m15 in this case), and better a close above 50ema of that lower TF. we also look for a breakout, and in this case we do have a breakout of the green TL. but still it's better to wait for a m15 close above 50ema. this will render a buy setup with FEs placed as shown in the chart hope that makes sense bro. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
FE's with hidden divergence are VERY powerful. gives u a very good idea where price is heading.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Yeah definately need to wait for the close above 15mins 50ema to be sure. But for me at this time of night, markets are slow and I don't usually like to trade much

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Does anyone think long position on gj 5m tf is valid? Ouch!!!!!! too much breaking and retracing on the 5m tf,it closed above gann and even 50ma and every other conditions tallying,but it went down so soon Lilmoe,i think i better stick to 15min for entrance and use 5min to get my exit positions.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Ah, I'm just demo trading right now, trying to get a better grasp on how to trade this way.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
read my other 2 posts following ur question

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I'm not sure, but that looks to me like classic bearish divergence on the 5min TF..

--- 帖子 #463 ---
If this lilmoes first strategy, then strickly - no. As you are below the DP. But if you trading a divergence etc then sure. I don't see anything on 5mins right now thou.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
nope, we're below DP, and close to a very congested area of m30 and below 50ema's (m5/m15/m30 50ema).... i'm starting to think we need to close above all that first before longs are valid. and to be really safe, wait for an m30 buy signal and buy dips afterwords. otherwise, an m30 sell signal will turn "sell rallies" mode on. we are at critical levels here. and it's best to wait. this IS 139 after all.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
My First Trade

--- 帖子 #466 ---
ao is everyone doing,guyz i went short on gu,15m giving me the entry signal. Who's in?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
hi bro! Please can u explain to me ao i got it wrong when i saw the rejection on gann and i went short but it immediately shoot up later,though i took the long position when i saw the divergence playing out on the 5min. I just want to know if a rejection on gaann after divergence has played out is not a valid signal.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
the bullish div that led price to go up wasn't met by a bearish HD when price hit 50ema... it means that price might not stop there. when u want to go short at 50ema or a higher TF gann, make sure u see a bearish HD bro...

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Morning Bro, Took the valid 5mins signal earlier, which then led to a 15mins and 30mins signal. Rode it down to the low, which is also where I have S1.... 110 pips - bagged. Will see what happens here now, but my chart feed is messing up today so having troubles with the charts. Had to move over to GFT charts...

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hey, u lost me here Bro..... bullish HD on 30mins, so were going up.. But ur saying a close "below" the lower TF Gann. I understand the close above the lower TF 50ema, that's sweet...but Surely if we close below a lower TF Gann this will then act a resistance for our bullish HD on the 30mins

--- 帖子 #472 ---
good morning big guy. i made the same entry on the m30 chart and yes, it is valid! we should see some small new lows today, but be careful of a reversal... i'm targeting 136 for now.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Took a small short off the bearish HD on 5mins. Entry was at the upper TF Gann around 137.12. Also ties in with a 15min bounce off CCI - 100

--- 帖子 #474 ---
great bro. i took half off for 33 pips and set the rest to a 50 pip SL (a bit over m5 50ema ) nice scalps on that 1m 50ema bounce

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I saw a 5m HD on gu,hope it runs well. Price trying to get below 5m gann Lilmoe what can u say about this? May i also ask if u use this sytenm to trade gbp/usd as well?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
momentum and PA. FIBO 382, and I am expecting some movement to DOWN side. let's play http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-304.png

--- 帖子 #477 ---
these bullish HDs on 1m need to go away!! looool

--- 帖子 #478 ---
yeah, I am waiting for the 15mins bearish HD to play, we already bounced from 30mins Gann, but I'll wait for a close below 5mins Gann and LTL to be sure. What dya think bro ? also notice how the previous CCI trendline is acting as resistance

--- 帖子 #479 ---
watch that TL and DS1 on 5min.. close bellow.. and there we go. From the other side, NY open is in 15 min, so some impulse buying or selling can we expect.. (imo)

--- 帖子 #480 ---
my system works on pretty much everything and yes i also took a short at m5 50ema also added another short at m30 gann

--- 帖子 #482 ---
bro, a Question? when you have a breakout on CCI like this, how do you confirm the Breaks ?? http://www.doske.com/fx/snapshot-305.png

--- 帖子 #483 ---
i'm with u bro

--- 帖子 #484 ---
since it broke out, we need a close below the 0 line (because that's the level it was above before the breakout) to confirm it we still didn't get that, so that breakout wasn't confirmed.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
was thinking the same. still, not much buying, as a ADP report is on 5 min btw, mom, remain on 0 line... so it is a momentum Bearish Divergence

--- 帖子 #486 ---
ope the news will break it all the way to hell..like Karmo say

--- 帖子 #487 ---
So they same thought of thing that happened this morning. ?? CCI TL broke out and then closed below -100

--- 帖子 #488 ---
yep, u sell at the breakout, AND the retest just like u'd do with price.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
added another short at 1m 50ema

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Sorry Lilmo.May I ask you why.I don't see any bearish divergences. I know it's hard,but would you please put some charts when you get a chance. I am still reading and sometimes I really get lost in switching between here and my charts to see what you say Mike

--- 帖子 #491 ---
lol, it's ok, that short was long closed and gone by now.... i reshorted at m30 50ema i'll post 2 charts, 1 for the setup u were asking about, and another for the current setup. here's the old one for 1m chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) here's the current M30 setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Thanks Lilmo, BIG HELP Mike

--- 帖子 #493 ---
did u catch that short off m30 50ema??

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Ok Lilmo, I've had this question for a long time.I tried to find my answer but NO RESULT!! Sorry if it's a dumb question but it's killing me. It is about the TL you draw.I used Photoshop to explain it better. In the 2nd chart how you draw that green tl? Do you wait for a bounce of 50?If so then you couldn't put a sell stop on 50 ema.you had to wait for the bounce. My question is how you know that the below chart wouldn't happen and you wouldn't get the HH in price. I hope you understand what I mean. Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hey Mike, The thing here is that usually when a HD is present, it will bounce off the higher TF's Gann - which is exactly what this did - just before it flipped down.. This is how I have been trading these all day.... If I see a hidden bearish diverg on say the 15 min chart - I'll check the 30 min chart and the price should bounce from it's Gann Hope this helps ? I can try to post an example if you want Edit: Charts posted Ok I know it looks messy, but if you look at the 2nd chart it shows bearish HD on 5mins. Lilmoe's rules state that price should always bounce from the higher TF's Gann. As it did in the 1st picture 15mins

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Thank you so much. So you mean for that M30 setup which Lilmo posted he already seen a Bearish HD in M15 and then set a sell stop on M30 50 ema or Gann? Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #497 ---
On the M30 chart lilmoe posted, price bounced down right off the 1hr Gann ( just before it flipped )

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thanks Crispin, I have to run to work. Could you please do me a huge favor.When you see a HD and setting a pending sell or buy on the higher TF Gann or 50 ema ,post it here. I mean posting a chart live not after fact.Just one or two is enough. it would be kind of you. Thanks again Mike

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Sure thing mate, I'll try to. I'm in the office now for the next 2 days, so there'll be now trading for me, so see you next week

--- 帖子 #500 ---
but but but, i DID post that m30 hart before it played out, lol. take care bro.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I saw this bullish HD on 5m tfails,as it stood for my exit point.Miss some pips rushing out when i saw it.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hi , I was wondering could we call this Bearish HD in M15 and put a sell order on 50 ema .it is on M15 TF. Reason rice is in a down trend but we are getting HH in MACD. Mike Edit:I just saw your post in Aus .I guess it's right. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...stcount=146062

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Are we all busy to say hi!!!!!!! Anyway i make some pips trading both gu and gj using this lilmoe stuff today.Lilmoe be glad to hear ur set up for the next possible trade.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
here's another live example of hidden divergence with 50ema. price bounce right from 50ema, and gave me an opportunity to make 80 pips but i only got 50 out of it, and now the rest is at b/e. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #505 ---
that wasn't too hard, was it now mike perfect call, and great job! grab what u can, and set your stop at b/e or -30 (whichever works for u)

--- 帖子 #506 ---
hey there! mike was faster in posting a great setup! was pretty easy to catch some more pips there!

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Lilmoe, Am kind of waiting for this news to go away,miss the entry.I hate to be in when news were release. I saw ur post in auslanco and u talkd about a massive drop down.I'm hoping this play out right 'cos i need money...........lol

--- 帖子 #508 ---
lol, this all depends on how we close this week. we need to close at or below these current levels next week would be sell the rallies if this works out

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Thanks Lilmo, I don't know really.Sometimes I really get confused and desperate. I think I should see a doctor But anyways please post few more charts when it's happening.It's a big help to open our eyes. Thank you Mike

--- 帖子 #510 ---
u got it

--- 帖子 #511 ---
OK, Could we call this clasic Bearis Div. in M5.so waiting for TL break and price close below -100 in CCI to go short. Is it right? -100 CCI or we should wait for closing below 0 line in CCI? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #512 ---
For a short, would the target be the gann line?

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hey LilMoe, We are almost to the level in AJ where Australian bank seems to keep intervening, do you think this will cause a bounce off 134?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
yea it's a bearish div, but wait for a breakout and CCI below the 0 line.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
yep, that would be ur first target...

--- 帖子 #516 ---
i really don't keep an eye on AJ... but anything's possible. i , however, believe there won't be intervention this time... we should go down as long as this week closes below 137.70

--- 帖子 #517 ---
thanks lilmoe. i'm getting there . . . on demo.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Yeah, even the central banks don't have enough money to stop all this negative sentiment. BTW Thanx for sharing your method, maybe i can be successful with it, if i can stay disiplined, looking forward to more of your analysis.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
u'll do much better when u learn how to do it on ur own bro

--- 帖子 #520 ---
bro did you notice the daily momentum?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I am still trying to figure out these divergences, looks like dow jones daily has huge bullish divergence, this might be a good place to start the carry trade again.??!?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
What do you make of the GJ having bullish divergences and still moving lower, i thought higher timeframe was more reliable?

--- 帖子 #523 ---
wondering if this is correct for bullish divergence and how it might play put if its correct . thanks trendline on price should be on bottom

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Thanks Lilmo, Any sell oreders on 50 ema H1? Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #525 ---
yep!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
no bro, you have the line drawn incorrectly from a "previous" bottom on MACD. you draw that line from 2 consecutive bottoms on MACD... hope that makes sense....

--- 帖子 #527 ---
yes bro, but without a divergence momentum pointing up or down doesn't mean anything to me momentum on the daily currently is pointing upwards, if we had a bullish classic divergence on the 1h or 4h charts, then we'd expect a retracement to daily 5sma, give or take...

--- 帖子 #528 ---
ic edit: you know bro, this system worth to make EA for as its rules are so easy to be programmed but the problem that im having is how to let it identify the divergance, i mean, if the market is making no higher highs or lower lows but cci is going down, it will be identified as a div, so .. is there any indicator that catchs the divergances that i see how it works?

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Here!

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Could that be because of this classic Bearish Div in M30? Mike

--- 帖子 #531 ---
thanks buddy, i'll take a look at the code and check out what can i do :d

--- 帖子 #532 ---
that's still hidden bearish, and i'm waiting for 137.70 to short

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Sorry Lilmo I don't get it. Is 137.70 your 50ema in H1 TF? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #534 ---
nope, my 1 hour 50ema is 137.50, HOWEVER, we have a bullflag on the 1m-5m chart, and a flag poll of 100 pips, i also believe that 137.70 is a more critical level that needs to be at least retested before we go back down, or at least for the 1h/m30 bearish HDs to start kickin in! i know it sounds weird, but we do pierce through 50ema's sometimes, but the longer u trade, the more your gut feeling will tell u where price should stop or at least go.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
that was a very good lesson to me, to "blindly" follow my own system, and not what my gut feelings say, looooooooooooooool... price literally Kissed 1h 50ema and TANKED from there!!!!

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi Lil If you check the second chart in post 4 it seems te same ting has happend now

--- 帖子 #538 ---
bro, i'm not sure i understand what u're asking here....?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
GM mate, sorry, but i have to laugh, because does happend to me plenty times.. Hope you had a good trading day with full bag of Pips

--- 帖子 #540 ---
+21 PIP MOVE

--- 帖子 #541 ---
it's all right bro, sometimes things happen....

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Lilmo, I was wondering would you put a sell order on 50ema(Aqua line) in M15. If not why? Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #543 ---
hope everyone's having a great weekend. here are some of my predictions for next week posted on auslanco's thread... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...42#post2400942 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...87#post2400987 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...05#post2401005

--- 帖子 #544 ---
sorry for the late reply... yes that was a correct setup that did play out

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Thanks Lilmo And have a good weekend too. Mike

--- 帖子 #546 ---
now that's nice

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Wow, I guess I've been so busy that I didn't even notice that Lil'Moe had come up with his own system...

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Sweet, isn't it!

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hello, I have been on a long position since early today,pips are rolling in.But,am considering Lilmoe's claim on the issue of the drop down.I have to be on the trailing stop for now. Good way to start the week.Hope it continues this way till the rest of the week,am loving it men. Am up 200 pips already.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Did anyone take short on 15, bearish hd off 50ema?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
it was pretty nice and easy, but i wasn't around when it touched 50ema

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi Lilmo, Hope everything is fine.Is this chart match with this post in Aus? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...stcount=147499 Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #553 ---
bro, on MACD you have to draw the trendline from highs, u can't draw from high to low look for the previous high on MACD, it wasn't very far from the 0 line on MACD.. then draw that line to our current high.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Thanks Lilmo.So you mean like this? Mike

--- 帖子 #555 ---
nope.... lol like this! connect 2 previous peaks. where price has a high, then a lower high. but MACD made a high then a HIGHER high. ps: i didn't draw the TL on price, u have it right, i just did the one on MACD Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Lilmoe, Do you find your strategy to work in all sessions, or is it more profitable during certain ones?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
hi lilmoe, I'm new here and to forex so would appreciate for any comments that you have for me. Like that way you made it easier to for people like me to understand your system. my question is: on your chart i can't see the HD on the MACD. The 3 lines drawn on your CCI and MACD indicator are just to show the CD on your Rule 2. how did you know PA was gonna rebound from the 50EMA apart from the bounce from 100 from your CCI30?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
yes all sessions for all pairs

--- 帖子 #559 ---
hi there. that chart was an ideal world setup for my system. i used it for a clear picture of what i mean. now, if u take a good look at the lines again, u'll see that i market the classic bullish divergence with "green" lines. however, the hidden divergence was marked by a "blue" line. i'm sure u have a good idea what classic divergence is. hidden div on the other hand is the complete opposite. we had a higher high in price at 241 (weekly chart), and then a LOWER high at 215. MACD had made a HIGHER high when price was at 215. and how did i know it should bounce from 215 and not from any lower level? it's because 50ema was there. 50ema with hidden div should cause a bounce which it actually did hope things are clearer now.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Im also practising the scalping techniq something similar to lilmoes when the market is slow. My original sell would have been on the red descending upper TL that comes from the dayly, but i was asleep when price touched it. I drilled to 5m and spotted a potential bearish HD divergence on the double top and 138 sweetspot. Price came down as it was declined by CCI 100 level and was finding resistance below the 138 sweetspot. That was the early sell signal if i understand correctly, but also we could have entered when 5m cable closed below its 50ema and 5m gann for a 0 drawdown trade. Im posting a chart so the master of scalping - lilmoe can take a look and tell me what he thinks. ps. the stop would have been placed above the previous high on the 5m.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi, I guess I am getting it now after few month If I am not wrong again In a downtrend when price start rising and we get a Higher High in MACD we say :"Ok, this is a Bearish HD so it mean trend continuation which is down. SO the best place for price to bounce would be 50 ema. So we put a sell order on 50 ema. Is that right? I changed your chart a little bit.If it's wrong let me know to change it please. Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #562 ---
yup certainly clear now. for the classic bullish divergence, although the price was going lower, the CCI and MACD actually was bullish for the same time period. coupled with the cross over above -100. this served as confirmation. my question is: do you need both indicators to show divergence before your system allows you to make the trade?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I think we have such a senario here: 1) Price is in downtrend 2)Price is rising 3) Higher high in MACD( Bearish HD) 4) Best place to bounce back -----&gt;50 ema

--- 帖子 #564 ---
allow me to say, please correct if i'm wrong. i see this that chart as having 2 peaks. so the first peak is much higher than the second. from the indicators, the MACD shows a divergence when you draw on the histogram at the position of the 2 peaks. the CCI30 shows this as well. this is the hidden bearish divergence, since it's not shown on the indicator. for the retracement, the indicator tells us that this is gonna happen as it is clearly (classically) bullish on the CCI30 and the MACD.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
u got it right this time!! the TL we draw on price is only to make it clear that price has made a lower low, it's necessarily one that should hold btw.

Hi, Lil, It is my first post in the thread, however, I have been following such an interesting method for quite a while. I have a couple of questions about setups for GY today...If you find some spare time could you be so kind to clarify a couple of moments for me? At about 12 50 there formed bearish HD on 5 minutes but CCI was already above 100 and price above EMA50, so I decided to look at 15 bounce from EMA50 and 0 CCI line, a bit later on 15 min tf formed bearish HD, so I was sure it would bounce. It did for a candle, so I was lucky to get some small gain, but then it soared quickly as u can see from the screenshots below. I was analyzing that trade and could not get why. Could it be because of bullish HD on 1H which was not broken at that time?? Need your help in that. Was my thinking correct? So do u usually look at higher timeframe as well? Thanx in advance.

i made this trade. the CCI cross 100. there was a classic bearish divergence on the M15. can lilmoe comment on this? hope i'm seeing this correctly

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hi Lilmoe, sorry but I am not an english native speaker and I am having problems in understanding rule #2: rule #2 : when CCI and/or MACD detect a classic divergence while price is touching a strong SR level when CCI is below / above the -100/0/100 line (in that established trend), price tends to "seek" 50ema of that timeframe IF CCI makes it back above / below the -100/0/100 lines. classic divergence is confirmed when a trendline is broken (example in chart). a classic divergence is not necessary for this to happen, but in most cases it does. could you please rewrite this in a different manner? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hahaha, this is NOT english, this is traderish. Hope he can translate it for you.

Classic double top with bearish HD - lovely

--- 帖子 #572 ---
it means when for a trend reversal to take place, there must be, for e.g. a downward to upward trend 1. crossing from bearish to not bearish (from below -100 to above 100). 2. there must be a classic divergence in CCI and/or MACD. if 1) and 2) is fulfilled, the retracement will try to seek 50EMA in the same TF. this retracemnt is confirmed by breaking of TL. please comment. hope i made it clearer.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Another bearish HD on the 15m and the 61.8 retrace with dayly S1 in confluence. 50ema gave a little early signal though. What you think lilmoe?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
not necessarily, but if both give the same signal the better. i usually am satisfied with a signal from MACD, that's why it' there, otherwise i'd use CCI alone. but always make sure that CCI doesn't cross a level when it's close to 50ema or a strong S/R level on the TF that a divergence is present. NOW, in the case where 2 timeframes show the same divergence, CCI30 of the HIGHER timeframe should be the one u look at for not breaking a cci level

--- 帖子 #575 ---
i don't use the indicator he does to automatically detect a div, but u're correct. there was a bullish div on cci that caused price to spike up to touch 50ema then rebound from there after it was held by a counter hidden div. kindof what i have on the second rule of my system

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hello lilmoe. How you doing big brother? We have classic bearish divergence on the 15m GBP/USD. Do you trade classic divergences like hidden ones, or no? Also 15 bearish classic on the GBP/YEN.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
hi lilmoe, do you have an example for this? thanks.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
hi lilmoe, what if the price does not retrace back to 50EMA/Gann in the particular TF, how do you know when to get out of that trade?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
short at retracement to 5sma. Bearish HD. But CCI30 is questionable. would you go for it?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
That is classic bullish div on your chart hwsv07

--- 帖子 #581 ---
This is what Bearish HD looks likes. (green bars on macd). Current 1 hr chart.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
can someone tell me how i add/save one of the indicators to my metatrader 4?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
This may explain it better. Current 1 hr chart.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
And at the current time, you can see bullish HD on the 5 min. Price keeps bouncing to the 1 hr 50 and back down forming bullish HD on the 5 min. This is great for scalping up and down until it finally breaks out.

YW

--- 帖子 #588 ---
erm.. i still do not get it. isn't that the same case for as your example? for a Bearish HD: Price LL; Indicator HH. for my chart #579: my price was making lower lows. but my MACD was showing higher highs. does it not fulfil the condition? so just to confirm my understanding: if the prediction plays out; the PA should move lower?

--- 帖子 #589 ---
do you mind taking out that particular time period out from your chart and show all the entry and exit points? my brain's going gaga just deciphering whether to enter cos there's hidden/classic bearish/bullish div and what not... thanks a million; if you could do this.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
hwsv07..you may need to read page one of lilmoes thread again to get a better understanding of enrties and exits. Im not real sure what you are asking. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
hi there, and im very sorry for the late reply... busy week, holidays and stuff, also trying to trade was a handful. so sorry again. i had some trouble at first trying to understand what ur question was. but after reading the post a couple of times more i think i get the picture. that's a good question by the way anyway, looking back at the same scenario u're suggesting. u were correct for waiting for the higher level TF for a 50ema bounce (rule#4), because cci was above the 100 line and the bearish HD formed WHEN price was above 50ema on the 5m chart. the higher TF in that case was m15 just like u mentioned. and again, just like u mentioned m15 DID form a bearish HD when we price reached its 50ema. in this particular case it means that we're trading the bearish HD on the m15 chart combined with that of the m5 chart. i wont post a chart since your post was pretty comprehesive and u get the picture. as u probably have read in my posts, the 1st target of the HD is most likely gann of that TF if price was above gann (in the case of that bearish HD)... now if we look back at that scenario u'll find that m15 gann was actually reached. it is true that good MM is the way to go, and it's true that i set my SL to B/E or +1 to +10 most of the time, but that doesn't mean it wont get hit. there are instances when 50ema is retested several times, which was exactly the case before m15 gann was hit. each time provides u a good trade opportunity with minimum SL unless one or more of the following occurs. 1) we close above m15 50ema (in that case) 2) CCI breaks a level (the 0 line in the case of that m15 bearish HD) 3) the HD is broken (and the following are only my personal way of judging a broken HD, it's not necessarily true ALL the time): a) MACD built a bottom (bottom pink bars), then makes peak (blue) bars, which in that case provides either continuation or another signal. the bearish HD is valid only if we still had blue bars on MACD and didn't yet creat pink bars. if you add the 0 level to MACD u'll see that blue bars are above the 0 line, and pink lines are below the 0 line. ( i know this might sound a bit confusing at first, but try reading (a) a couple of times till u understand what i mean ) b) the price that GJ made when MACD first peaked was taken out, and in that case it was 138.6x, where u drew that TL on price (the left side of the TL) i personally made a couple of short entries at that setup. made 40 pips the first time and 70 pips the second time, where both my second halves of the trade were stopped out... but still managed to make some hope this answers ur question, plz DO NOT hesitate to ask anything else if things are still not clear, if u don't understand something then i'm sure someone else doesn't. it would be nice if we make things clearer for everyone i was going to rewrite the rules, but i think i'll wait till most of u guys finish asking ur questions so that i know what points i should "underline" and which i should explane further.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
the trade was prefect however, that wasn't a trade according to my system, it was simply a trade based on a double top with a classic bearish divergence. remember, it wasn't me who discovered divergence (Classic or hidden), i just combined many theories and created a system out of it

--- 帖子 #593 ---
ok, i will try to explain it using a scenario. i won't post a chart because i have one already posted with the exact same "ideal world" scenario. note : i have the word "price" in purple, meaning that u're looking at GJ's candlesticks, and price touched a strong S/R level. now for the scenario 1) price is going down in a bearish market. 2) price starts forming a classic bullish divergence, where an indicator/oscillator is forming a higher low when price is making lower lows. 3) price bounces off a strong S/R level and BREAKS the bearish trend's descending trendline. 4) CCI30 of that TF was trading below the -100 line. but after price has broken the descending trendline it closed back ABOVE the -100 line meaning that a significant level was broken. if we have all the above met. then according to that rule, price tends to reach 50ema of that particular timeframe and if a hidden divergence forms when price touches 50ema, price usually bounces back and continues in the direction of the main trend afterwords. hope this makes things clearer.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
hey there bro... sorry i wasn't replying lately but i was VERY busy... and yes, i do trade classic div

--- 帖子 #595 ---
good question... we had a very good example back in september when price did NOT reach 50ema on the daily chart. this happens usually when there's a trendline, gann of a higher TF, or a strong s/r level before 50ema. that's why the concept of partial profit exists if another case such as the one u're asking about presents itself i will post and discuss it without delay

--- 帖子 #596 ---
bro, we do NOT have a bearish HD there. that's a very common example of a classic bullish divergence. plz try to distinguish between classic and hidden divergencies. piters have posted some good materials on both subjects so do lots of websites out there. try to google classic and hidden divergence and u'll get LOTS of materials about it that should explain things further in detail

--- 帖子 #597 ---
thanks pipchick, not only are u right, but u've been a lot of help and inspiration for me

--- 帖子 #598 ---
hi pipchick and lilmoe, i do get the idea of classical and hidden divergence already. perhaps i'm still not used to them. thanks for pointing out to me,and would appreciate your guidance should i make a wrong call again.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
bro, classic divergence is as strong as hidden divergence. however, they are both the opposite in terms of highs and lows. classic bullish divergence: price makes a lower low, but the indicators make a higher low. classic bearish divergence: price makes a higher high, but price makes a lower high. hidden bullish divergence : price makes a higher low, indicator makes a lower low. hidden bearish divergence : price makes a lower high, indicator makes a higher high write that down on a piece of paper, and print out a 1 example chart of each, and stick it next to your screen. that might help out

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Happy to help hwsv

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I understand how to spot divergences but am still confused if we only use MACD for hidden and CCI for classic,, or if we can use both/ either or of MACD and CCI to spot divergences. Thx!

--- 帖子 #603 ---
both... or any other indicator u feel more comfortable around... that's only my personal preference... i use MACD for both classic and hidden, and i use CCI for classic and SOMETIMES for hidden. other people use stochastics for divergence, and some use RSI...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
My pleasure moe and same goes for you! YOu have helped tremendously.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Does anyone else see a lilmoe 30 minute intraday trade in effect? Price is above the daily pivot and the M30 50ema; CCI is above 100; no hidden divergence that I can detect. Looks like we even had a 30 minute 5sma retrace . . .

--- 帖子 #606 ---
1 hr bearish HD on gj

--- 帖子 #607 ---
do you think the bearish HD would play out on the H1?

--- 帖子 #608 ---
5m bearish HD was visable so i took a short from the nearest resistance - 1hr 50 ema. Entered @ 136.31. Closed too early with 5 pips profit. Should have kept my SL @ 136.50 and i would have caught more pips. Lilmoe tell me if i entered my first ever scalp from divergence your style the right way? Posting a chart. Cheers

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Another great sell of the 5m 50ema with Bearish HD present on the gbp/chf...though i wasnt watching this pair and missed this sweet cherry... Also GBP/USD had same bearish HD and a short of 5m 50ema...Sweet trades they were

--- 帖子 #610 ---
is this a short according to the rules, lilmoe? below -100 CCI. below gann, 50ema, DP.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hey Bro, How you doing ? Work has been tough for me so not much trading these days, but thought I'd post a chart for comments

--- 帖子 #612 ---
this is according to the rules. but from chart, there's actually a classical bearish. so would this have been a good entry?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
since there's a lower TL of a daily falling wedge, the rules also say we need to close below that before u can short.... but your other example on that GJ long was correct...

--- 帖子 #614 ---
perfect setup

--- 帖子 #615 ---
sorry limoe, i did not really see the lower TL of the UJ. could you show on a chart? yup and i agree since the price has to be at least 100 pips below a major or strong s/r - fibo level, before short. it was a bad call anyway, as the PA went up.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
hi i was thinking. there was no close below CCI -100. Bearish HD would be even better since it would be an enhanced short entry. I'm just sometimes confused about the SL management. how much TP should i be looking for?

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Daily UTL broken. Classical Bullish detected. CCI cross from -100 to above 100. =&gt; trend reversal and seek daily 50ema. question is: but rule 1 is not satisfied? so weekly trend is not bullish.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Bearish HD was present. Re-read my post.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
hi i did read it right i guess. I did not say the bearish HD was not present. what i meant was, if a bearish HD was present, would that support your entry since it was a short?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Are you high? Ofcourse when we have bearish HD we look for shorts lol

--- 帖子 #621 ---
1hr bullish HD with a confluence of ascending lower TL, 50% fib retrace and 50 ema And look at that bounce wow im impressed lilmoe about this techniq . lovely

--- 帖子 #622 ---
What is happening,gj gives a perfect entry for short on 30min and it immediately retrace back to the pivot point.This is a little becoming something of unpredictable since yesterday.Do anyone see any divergence,'cos i could'nt see anything that brings about the retracement.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Perfect long of the 1hr bullish HD in confluence with 50% retrace to the lower TL and 1hr 50 ema. Perfect long setup.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
hey I was wondering how you time your exits?

--- 帖子 #625 ---
5m bearish HD provided a nice short op on the bounce from 15m 50 ema for a nice 50 pips, though i missed it during conversation with a fellow trader buddy of mine. Hope you guys caught it

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Well im more of a swing trader but i have started to scalp GBP/YEN not long ago using my own method with some divergence techniqs added from the owner of this thead - lilmoe. He say that usually the bounce from x timeframes 50 ema yiels the x timeframes gann. So basically if we longed that from 1hr 50 ema so we should have taken profit @ 1hr gann, but it was never reached, and 5m bearish HD divergence formed and played out nicely. So basically when we are scalping we need to lock in partial profit. Lets say when we are up 50 we take 1 lot of, on 100 another, and leave 1 running. Or whtever that makes you comfortable with. Im not saying the 1hr gann wont be reaches but we have to be safe and to give away green pips - naaah, not worth it hope it clears a little

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Signals was everywhere. 5m bearish HD on cable of the 50 ema played out very well. Im still too slow to catch these moves lol

--- 帖子 #628 ---
100 pips ABOVE and S/R level when u're going for a short...

--- 帖子 #629 ---
what short entry?? all i see right now is bullish HDs...

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hola Hola

--- 帖子 #631 ---
sorry bekelas. haha cos i am still getting used to divergence, so i probably sometimes just post the obvious stuff to make sure what i am thinking and writing is correct. hope you do not mind me... by the way, how would you know which TF to switch to to take the short from? like the recent GJ H1 Hidden Bullish Divergence and the subsequent M5 down action, how would you know which TF to apply?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I would suggest you reading the thread once again to understand the basic principles of S&amp;R. And ask the great lilmoe to clear some things up for ya

--- 帖子 #633 ---
hey there!

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I see bullisj HD everywhere as well. Shall we see a bull run in the NY session? Whats your take buddy. I think thats pretty possible

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Classic bullish divergence on the 15 and 30 cci30

--- 帖子 #636 ---
So we bounced off the 61.8 of yesterdays move..We have Bullish HD on the 1 hr and Classic bullish div on the 15 and 30 and we have formed an abcd pattern for longs.We "should" go up from here.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Can you post a chart please

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Sorry it took so long belekas..I am having intermittent connection. Here is the 15 min chart with classic bullish div and also the 1 hr ABCD

--- 帖子 #639 ---
we have classical bullish divergence on CCI30 and the MACD. and yup, bekelas, i'm rereading all over again just to get it right. hope i got chart readings right. now waiting for M15 CCI30 to close above -100 for trend reversal.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Doing perfect hwsv.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Excelent charts. Lets see if it plays out alright. Cheers lady

--- 帖子 #642 ---
i think it is too... we should at least see a retest of the highs...

--- 帖子 #643 ---
i believe we should go up from here too

--- 帖子 #644 ---
lilmoe, there's a classical bullish div on the CCI30 and MACD on the daily GJ. do you trade daily TF?

--- 帖子 #645 ---
yes i trade that TF... and i see what u see.. try to go back to crispin's post and u'll see the setup u're talking about... our target should be daily 50ema at the least for the next coming days that's rule#2 by the way...

--- 帖子 #646 ---
haha. this is gonna sound amateurish. but since but your rule2 it's gonna try and seek 50ema. then why are you bothered by the PA now? or are you trying to "buy the dips"? and lilmoe, just a setup question. is the setting for your system for MACD 5,34,9 or 12,26,9?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Thx for the reply, that helps!

--- 帖子 #648 ---
sorry had to laugh for a bit... yes my initial target is 50ema on the daily... BUT i'm trying to load as many longs as i can... bad PA keeps stopping out my newly added longs at B/E 5.34.9 is what i use for my system... but right now i'm working a bit with 12.26.9 because it's sometimes "cleaner"

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Good work Lilmoe!! Excellent thread bro

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Euro will give a bounce down from the weekly 50ema in confluence with the 50% retrace @ 1.4200 for sure, as i see a potential bearish HD divergence in the in owen.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
oh i downloaded the template from post #3 and it is using 12,26,9. so i am not sure which is better for your system.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
thanks bro

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Came back from the toilet and see that i missed the shorts on guppy and cable from 5m bearish HD. Was there valid signals lilmoe, and how would you mange such shorts? I mean there wasnt 50ema nearby. So we could have sold below support, that means when candle closed below 5m gann. Make sense or not? Thanks

--- 帖子 #654 ---
5m bearish HD from the 50ema played out as expected. 50 pips on GU and GJ closed @ 5m Gann

--- 帖子 #655 ---
great job bro!

--- 帖子 #656 ---
now that i look at the charts again, i noticed that i made a terrible mistake... there was an OBVIOUS bullish HD on the 4h chart and a CCI rejection of a trendline and the -100 line... the 1st target of the bullish HD was 4h gann which was reached obviously... i need to start paying more attention.. i'm losing focus!!! we also bounced from 61.8 fibo with some sort of double bottom with a bullish divergence on m30... so yes, the long was supposed to be there, and that 300 pip target was "obious"... chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) however, there's still a bearish HD on the 1h chart targeting 1h gann soon at around 135.50-136 area... in the longer term, the bullish HD on the 4h chart should resume unless broken. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Exactly what i see as well. Cable has 4h bullish HD as well. I want to ask you as we have 1hr bearish HD on the geppy targeting 1hr gann, where would you see actually? As we dont have 50ema to play a short bounce, so id like to hear what do you prefer

--- 帖子 #658 ---
but the H1 50ema is proving to be a resistance for PA to get past to reach the H1 Gann... and what's more you still have the DP in the way as well. edit: ok as i type, everything i said above is about to be breached.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
lilmoe, this is a perfect setup. bounce of +100 CCI30 bearish HD.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
actually i think the same setup was also present in UJ. is this setup valid? lilmoe, how far back in the timeline do you look for divergence? cos on my chart, there's also a part where it is also blue, using this, would make the bearish HD invalid. thanks!

--- 帖子 #661 ---
target reached form 1h bear HD... hope u guys got that one, easy trade now, this should start going back up or just ranging for the day...

--- 帖子 #662 ---
i'm sorry for the late reply bro, but since we didn't have a 50ema on the 1h chart we look at the HIGHER TF 50ema or gann, it's in the rules

--- 帖子 #663 ---
bro, this time. all together with EU, and GU.. looks to me, you have to DIG out your crapper

--- 帖子 #664 ---
UJ doesn't have a clear hidden divergence. it might have one, but MACD isn't showing it clearly. there ARE times where MACD doesn't detect a hidden divergence when once is actually present. the way u drew that TL on MACD was incorrect. u have to connect the "peaks" which are the highest levels of the most recent rallies on that TF.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
looool GU doesn't look like it's ready to go down. trust me. there's a STRONG bullish HD forming on the 4h chart GU. it HAS to play out before we see any downside. selloffs are usually confirmed after a bullshit bullrun when bearish HDs start forming again on 1h and higher TFs

--- 帖子 #666 ---
i see. cos sometimes i have a problem of knowing at which point of the peak i should draw; and sometimes; one would draw what one would like to see... and for the 2nd question, how far back in the TF do you look for divergence? if you look carefully, there's actually a small peak there as well.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
GOT a lot of those PATIENCE pills mate.. I can WAIT lool, OK bro, I believe you.. I posted on AUS thread, we may range here a bit.. but.. what ever.. let's make pips BRO..

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Got the bearish HD very early today also off 1hr 50ema. Then traded the bullish HD off 5mins 50ema at around 136.30

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Took the long on the classic bullish divergence on the 5m. And went short again at the 50 ema. Take profit at the 5 minute gann. man i am loving this. Before i was stupid and trading this thing blind. now, i actually have a feel for the movements thanks to lilmoe and his system. Thanks bro.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
there needs to be another peak in price. macd alone just forming a small "insignificant" peak is not good enough... take it this way bro. if you don't see an "idea" setup, there's no need at all to take that trade. just a small piece of advice. i myself don't take just any setup i get, i want for a good one to form, and that's how i pick my trades. if u make 100 pips a day u're fine. i myself made a good deal so far. so i'm taking it easy u can be as extreme as u want when u get a better feel of this system and incorporate it with ur own system. so no need to rush.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
thanks bro! i hope i will get the hang of it.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
GU just did the retracement and drop back down thing on the M5

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Lilmoe, can you please analyse my setup? It's my first (so be gentle plz ) Green pips to all!! http://www.overseastravelservice.com...2017-19-13.png

--- 帖子 #674 ---
sorry bro, i was away... not bad for the first setup. but i've been wondering about that euro 1h chart all day... the only thing that is discouraging me is the previous bottom on MACD that is between the 2 bottoms u drew the trendline from... the price on the previous bottom was taken out (don't get confused, i'm just wondering if this setup is still valid)... the feel of the setup is good... but the charts are just weird, loool. u should make some good money out of that trade, because i think has NOT finished its uptrend yet, and i do believe we'll reach 1.4850 soon (september high).... could i be wrong? of course! lol

--- 帖子 #675 ---
What do you guys think about this setup on the hourly?

--- 帖子 #676 ---
well, for me i think it's good! if i saw the same thing, i would haven taken it as well. but i was looking at EU so did not managed to catch it. hope you did trade it cos it did play out.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Dear Lilmoe, I am posting Four Charts for GU - D1, H4, H1, M30 Please correct me if i am wrong in my analysis of divergence. D1 - Bearish Divergence H4 - Bullish Divergence H1 - Bullish Divergence M30 - Bullish Divergence If am correct then do u think Monday will be bullish day for GU ?. How often do you analyse for divergence ? Thanks in advance. Regards Rajat

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi, Lilmoe, Just want to thank you for the detailed answer to my question, it was exactly what I wanted. It seems that when posting the question, I forgot the rule about Gann as TP1 =) stupid me... Just one more question if you don't mind: I have read a lot of your analyses here and on the Auslanco's thread and it seems that you are using only tops and bottoms picking strategy, what about another one? (intraday swings...you told u use it to scalp 15 min). I use it when I do not see any divergence to play with...is it correct or U have abandoned the 1st strategy? because I could not see anyone posting about it in this thread... Thanx again for keeping up the good work, Have a nice weekend ) Peter

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Sorry, I have already found the answer in post 272 =))

--- 帖子 #680 ---
hi there, i check for divergence ALL the time, especially in corrective markets yes i think we might see a bullish start of the week on the GU, but it could test some more lows before doing so, not VERY low, but maybe 100-200 pips lower, UNLESS we close below daily gann, and that's where u should be careful with longs in the longer term.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
i saw ur other post where u said u found the answer, but here's something else i'd like to point out too. we are in a corrective market. corrective markets are hard to predict. my swing strategy as for other systems work best in a "trending market". actually my system works better than others when u look at pip gain. but since we're still in a ranging market, it's better to look at the top/bottom picking system with hidden divergence, gann, and 50ema rather than thinking "ok we go up here, or down there"

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Yes, it is exactly the same what I was thinking about. With divergence and targets as EMA50, Gann, Fibbs or strong S/R i feel much more confident than just trading when 5 ema cross ema50 gann pivot etc =)) Thanx again for all your help...Confidence is all I need )

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Lil Moe, Just wanted to wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. I wish you hefty pips next year ) Will be popping in here to post my trades if I have time...Hope to improve my skills further. Happy holidays to everyone in this thread Peter

Hey Bro, Just popped in to wish you and your family all the best and to say thanks for all the advice you give.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
hi everybody. hi lilmoe! this is my first post in this thread and first from a very long silence at FF. lilmoe - great stuff U are teaching here. although i have never tried any scalping - i am almost covinced i am still very sceptical because i have already met o lot defeated scalping funs. you guys here seem to be really prepared for the battle, i admire all of you. from my point of view (TF min 4h/1d) - there is still a lot of work to be done in the way down for GJ - i am still in shorts and prepering to add very soon. good luck fellows and happy new year. i will start watching market with your scapling stuff, who knows...

I just came across your posts. will be studying them... preciate the input and time u have spent to help others. have u thot about building an EA on this system? MacK

--- 帖子 #693 ---
actually no, haven't tried making one for my system. i believe it would be a bit harder than other systems to program...

it would be a buy signal if price touches 50ema, not a sell...

B4 reading this thread, I found it difficult to stay in a breakout. I might enter very well by using 15m gann and 5sma but I ussually leave b4 the breakout has run its course. But I will now at least know when a breakout has occuredand ride it through what I learnt about the CCI settings here. B4 I am used to leaving CCI at period 14 default and I am also afriad that when it goes above/below 100 cos of overbought or oversold conditions. thanks Lilmoe for the education.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
GM lilmoe, im a newbie, been reading posts on auslanco's thread for a while and think u guys r awesome, hope to see wat u guys see soon.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi lilmoe had a chance to read this thread over the holidays and i just want to say thanks. I must have read the first page at least 10 times, I think i am starting to get it. I finally understand divergences and im able to spot them, (Seems easy now). I really like your style of trading and hope to see some more of your trades in the future. I know there is a lot more i could learn from you. I hope all is well and you are feeling better,

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Lilmoe, hope you are doing well. Haven't seen you around for a week now.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
hello again folks, and sorry for not being around again... as some of u know, i live in Jordan, and we're border to border with palestine. so we were trying to help as much as we could, as u guys know the situation here in the Middle East. we're not border to border with gaza, but the west bank has also got its shares of wounded people, so we thought that's the least we could do. i would like to dedicate a post to those who lost their innocent lives in Gaza. the only sin they ever committed was holding on to the small remaining portion of their wasted and occupied lands. down with Zionism, and all of those who use brute force against unarmed people. Those who use "terrorism" as a excuse of gaining land and profit, and expressing their hate by killing people and twisting the truth around. and down with those who use the lives of their own people to make political and financial gains. good job hamas, in order for your sorry ass leadership to gain international representation of the Palestinian people, you wasted the lives of around 1500, and wounded over 6 thousand (and yes i am being sarcastic). we fought the romans, mongols, crusaders, brits, french, and now we fight the zionist jews. god bless our land, and god bless our people.

hello everyone, sorry for the absense, thought i needed to pass by to drop a little comment about this good setup. swing trade notice. weekly chart with bearish HD, price at 50ema. target should be FE 61.8, if not so then a good 50% retracement should be on the way, that's over 1500 pips. i went ahead and took this call since i was waiting for it for so long. and now here it is, SL should be pretty high so be careful everyone. setup: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #733 ---
and FULL moon.. lol... btw.. im posting you a daily in a bit.. suggesting 115 GY is set to down side.. but this is not a big drop from here. If yes then would be a suprise.. we go to 150 then back up. and the final down.. let me cook the EW charts in package.. maybe a little help from my side cheers

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Out with the bad in with the good .... glad to have you back around ... aus's thread needs you ....

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Piters, based on that chart, a swift downmove for $jpy soon? Wow... let's see where it goes

--- 帖子 #736 ---
GJ loves to play around with PA before a target is reached. we already know that. it had to perform a double top before the actual 50% retracement that i predicted with 50ema as a top on the weekly chart. 1st target reached back in sep. and now we're retesting the low of 140 which is very tough. things are STILL looking bearish for GJ, and i think 140 shouldn't hold for too long. CCI-30's -100 line looks like it's giving in, which means a very possible breakout downwards. if that level gives in, then i'm expecting the lows at ~120 to be retested, with possible lower lows. this should be a correctional wave btw, and corrections do establish new lows (or bottoms) in lots of cases.

esignal shows that UJ is now at 85.54.....

This system works on TF 5M? Need different settings of the indicators?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
don't worry too much about after hour prices. we've seen lots of cases where prices drop or rise 300+ pips and sometimes 500 pips, but in most cases prices went back to their closing values before market opens. so what really matters is where the prices is when the market opens sunday night.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
hey there. nice charts well, your h/s formation does look interesting, but it's never a h/s unless the neckline is broken. learned that the hard way

--- 帖子 #409 ---
i've used it on the 1m TF, and yes it works. but only the part about picking tops and bottoms, don't use the swing trade system for that TF... use 50ema and HDs

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Wishful thinking but you never know!!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
moe, you are not planning on taking another long vacation are you? thinking to hang out here if you don't mind so much.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Lilmoe Welcome back and keep the thread alive with your presence

--- 帖子 #416 ---
i'm not sure if it's a double head h/s but here's another possibility for your setup Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #417 ---
