I've had to adjust my thinking to this strategy a little because before, we were  concerned about catching the breakout and that was it. Now we're going  to pull pips off the reversals that were plaguing us to help offset any full reversals we'll encounter  and to be ready with trades already in place when the breakouts occur.  Now, we will not catch every breakout, but that is okay as we are not  going to sacrifice discipline for the sake of making profits, it doesn't pay to be greedy. Here you will find a revised version of my Simple London Breakout strategy. After some complications with regards to handling reversals within the original strategy, I sat down and studied the past charts to try and find a better way to take advantage of the days where we would get stuck in a ranging period. What I wanted to accomplish was to try and alleviate, or at least minimize, the damage of being stopped out on those reversals after our initial entries.

As I was finished working on other projects, I came back to my original strategy and I noticed a few things that were happening that we could take advantage of and make work to our benefit. I also found a few ways to try and help protect our profit taking along the way. What I was seeing was how often we would have our entry point hit and then magically have an immediate reversal right after that. A good friend suggested that in may be due to the fact that I was starting too early (the first strategy had the box end at the Frankfurt open at 7:00 GMT) and that I should include that whole hour and start the box right at the London open because we were probably getting false spikes from the Frankfurt open. He also suggested that maybe try and use the old entry point as a target instead. I will have to give some credit to rjlacha as I then remembered he open a thread a while back and was using the edge of the box as his entry point and I thought that could possibly work.

So, with the help of sqaulou's extraordinary coding skills, we develop a modified version of the London Breakout indicator for everyone to use (sqaulou is currently playing around with a new EA for this strategy which will come later after it is tested properly first). What we did was use the edge of the box as the new Entry Point the way rjlacha uses it and and incorporated a 3 tiered Profit Target setup to grab pips earlier in the trade and still be able to take more pips when the breakout occurs. As you all know, I am a big user of martingale techniques and that is carried over from the first thread with a little twist to it that I'll explain later as we put up some examples. So over the next few posts I'll be showing examples of perfect setups, reversal setups, and how we take profits in different scenarios.

The big difference in the modified indicator is that the "MaxBoxSizeInPips" parameter is now "MinBoxSizeInPips". The reason why is because our first profit target is not far from the entry point and we don't want the spread to eat up all the profit. Because of the parameter change it is best to use pairs with a smaller spread. You can use a pair with a larger spread but make sure to increase the "MinBoxSizeInPips" appropriately (default is 25). We really want to stay away from large boxes over 100-120 pips because Target 1's will be tough to reach and stop outs when we have reversals will be very costly. We have incorporated a 3 tiered profit target to this indicator to help the trader to visually see when to close each trade and when to adjust your stops. The default box times are from 05:00 to 08:00 GMT and we will not place any new trades after 17:00 GMT on Fridays as we do not want to get caught up in any gaps over the weekend. In fact, if you are showing any sign of profitability, I would suggest closing the trade and not holding them over the weekend. If your broker is GMT +0, you do not have to change anything. But if your broker for example is GMT +2 as with FXCBS (this is the broker I will be using for my examples), just add 2 hours to all the times to be correct. I'm using FXCBS because they have very lows spreads. You can check the spread of most brokers here to see where they stand compared to others. I've attached this indicator here to post #1 along with my template that I use.

I will only be watching 5 pairs on a 15 minute chart:

Eur/Usd, Gbp/Usd, Eur/Jpy, Usd/Cad, and Gbp/Jpy.

Gbp/Jpy is my experimental pair and have raised the minimum box size to 35. I will give setup examples using all the pairs but I will only be posting trade examples on Eur/Usd only to save time. I'm sure everyone will get the hang of it pretty quickly and be able to read the other charts on their own.

*Before we start, as courtesy, please refrain from comments about the nature of martingale strategies. We all know by now any inherent risks involved with using them and do not need to be reminded over and over. If you are one of those who hate martingale strategies, please just move on and not disrupt the thread, this will obviously not be for you. Also, please do not flood the thread with "you should do this or add this" or "this would work better" comments. I want prefer to stick to the original strategy posted, but if you want to play around with the settings and add other indicators, please feel free to do so on your own, otherwise it confuses those who want to follow the original premise of the strategy, thank you.*

***UPDATE***

Alright, sqaulou, our coder extraordinaire, has modified the indicator  and added two new functions. Well, actually, one function was an old  function that was added back in and the second one is new.

First one he added back into the indicator was the "MaxBoxSizeInPips" function. This  works similar to the "MinBoxSizeInPips" parameter in that it draws a red  box that says "No Trade!" when the box is over "X" number of pips

Now the new function added to the indicator is called the "LimitBoxToMaxSize". What it allows  us to do on occasions where the standard box size is too large, is it  limits the tradable box size to "X" number of pips. The indicator will  then calculate and center the box based on the median EMA comprised of  the 12 bars of the box. that way we start with a box that is not too  wide, but properly centered.

Examples are shown in posts 62 & 63. I've updated the template to use the new version of the indicator.

***UPDATE***
8/17/10
V3.1

sqaulou and I have added two (2) more target levels to the LBO indicator and have  posted it below along with a new template. For those traders out there that like to let your trades run,  this is for you. The neat option sqaulou added on this one is when you set the "TPFactor5" to "0", the indicator will only show 3 targets instead of 5. So you basically have 2 indicators in one. He also added a "BO" comment below the box (for BreakOut) to help distinguish the BreakOut strategy from the new Counter Trend strategy that will be introduced.

You will only see the input for TPFactor5 in the indicator's parameters  because TPFactor 4 is calculated the same as TPFactor2, by adding Target  3 & 5 together and dividing them by 2. Target 5 is set to the 3.618  Fib extension by default. Feel free to change it to whatever you are  comfortable using. He has also fixed it to where the zones are drawn over the weekend as well.

***UPDATE***
1/1/11

I have made a few changes (starting in post #988) regarding how to close trades and have e-mailed sqaulou to see if he can update the EA with these new changes

The initial trade setup is determined after the box has formed. Once formed we wait for a candle to breach the edge of the box, either long or short. The stop is going to be the opposite side of the box as in the previous thread, but this time around we will be moving the stop as targets are hit.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
When placing trades in the original strategy we only placed a single trade at the entry point and waited til we hit a target or got stopped out. With this strategy, you can place a single trade, 2 trades, or even 3 trades at the entry point. I will be placing 3 trades at the same time for all examples I will be giving you.

Again this is how a perfect trade would go:

1.) Price hits our entry point and we place three individual trades of whatever size your money management will dictate (make all 3 trades the same size).

2.) As price hits our Target 1, we close 1 of the trades and leave the other two trades open. Once the trade is closed (referred to as trade 1 from here on), move your stop on the other two trades to break even or as I do, break even +1 (guarantees you at least 1 pip upon a reversal).

3.) As price hits Target 2, we close 1 more trade (trade 2) and leave the last trade open. Once that trade is closed, move your stop on the last trades to Target 1 to lock in pips.

4.) As price hits Target 3, we close our last trade (trade 3).

In the pic below, on Gbp/Jpy last night we had a perfect trade setup that netted us +200 pips total on 3 individual trades (not including the spread). Perfect trades do not happen as often as we'd like to see, but that's okay, we have a plan for that.

Trade 1= +47

Trade 2= +100
trade 3= +153

Total     = +200

If your using only 1 trade, just move your stop at each target level. If you use 2 trades, close out trade 1 at Target 1 and move the stops on trade 2 as you reach each target. Like I said, I'm using 3 trade as I then can take 1 trade out at each target level.

Hi mer,

look interesting,may i know what TF are you using?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The timeframe you need to use is 15 minute.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

As I said in the previous post, perfect trades do not come around very often as they usually present themselves after a reversal. In this example, we had a couple of reversals before our perfect trade occurred. Now the weakness of the strategy is that when price hits our entry and reverses, we have 3 trades on the line and not 1. Instead of having a -26 pip loss (which is the size of the box), we have a -78 pip loss (3 trades x 26 pips).

This is where the martingale comes in to save the day. I use a multiplier with my trades when I have a loss and the sequence goes 1, 2, 5, 13, 34, 89, 233, and 610. I've noticed with this new version of the strategy that the multiplier rarely goes past 34. How the multiplier works is once we hit our stoploss, we close out all 3 trades and immediately enter 3 more trades short using the next multiplier in the sequence, in this case it would be 2. if we use .1 lots for an example, we would open those next 3 trades at .2 lots.

In this trade we had 2 reversals before we had our breakout. The first reversal we had stopped us out for -78 pips (3 x -26). We enter 3 more trades immediately using a multiplier of 2 to whatever lot size you used in the first trade. We ended up with a second reversal which stopped us out at -156 pips (3 x -26 x a multiplier of 2). Again, we immediately entered 3 more trades, this time with a multiplier of 5.

As we can see, the multipliers help us recoup are losses on the previous trades that didn't quite go our way. This is what it would look like with and without the multiplier:

No Multiplier

Trade 1= -26

Trade 2= -26

Trade 3= -26

Trade 1= -26

Trade 2= -26

Trade 3= -26

Trade 1= +16

Trade 1= +34

Trade 1= +52

For a total of -132 pips

With multiplier

Trade 1= -26

Trade 2= -26

Trade 3= -26

Trade 1= -52 (-26 x multiplier of 2)

Trade 2= -52 (-26 x multiplier of 2)

Trade 3= -52 (-26 x multiplier of 2)

Trade 1= +80 (+16 x multiplier of 5)

Trade 1= +170 (+34 x multiplier of 5)

Trade 1= +260 (+52 x multiplier of 5)

For a total of +276 pips

Quite a bit of difference, don't you think? Feel free to use your own style of multiplier and experiment a little. Some will just want to get the losses back with no additional profit and some will want a more aggressive approach.

Most of the time we are going to see reversals off of Target 1 a lot in  this strategy and we need to grab the pips when we can. The Target 1 is  placed at the 61.8 fib extension of the box, so it is going to be a  natural reversal point and this was causing  most of the issues in the  original thread since we were using it as an entry point instead of a  target.

In this example on Usd/Cad, we can see the long entries reversing off of Target 1. The is the reason I  have you move the stop to break-even or break-even +1 after hitting  Target 1 is because we are primed for a reversal at this point and saves  us from losing money on trade 2 & 3. If I would've trade the first  long, I would've made +34 pips on trade 1 and +1 pips each on trade 2  & 3 when they were stopped out on the reversal.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I'm sure a lot of you are wondering is there a rule to re-entering a trade? Yes. If you follow this rule it will save a lot of bad entries.

Do not re-enter a trade until a candle closes inside the box!

If we continue with the Usd/Cad chart from the previous post we can see that after we closed out our first set of trades we have a candle closing inside the box both at 13:30 and 16:00 GMT (15:30 and 18:00 GMT on FXCBS) The first re-entry netted us another +34 pips on trade 1 and then +1 pip each on trade 2 & 3 on the reversal (remember, we moved our stop to breakeven +1 upon hitting target 1!). The second re-entry was made as a short trade and we netted another +34 pips on trade 1 and trades 2 & 3 netted +72 and +111 pips respectively for a total of +289 pips, although we had to wait til the next day to close trade 2 & 3 out.

I prefer to let the remaining open trades run until they hit a target or stop out, just my preference. You can close out all open trades whenever you desire. I will not open any new trades after 01:00 GMT which is the end of the green zone on your charts.

I'll let everyone catch up and soak everything in and I will post some more examples later on.

Thanks for stopping in guys, if you any questions don't hesitate to ask.

Next example I want to show is handling a reversal and not getting to a target 2 or 3 and how to handle this. We can see as we start out with a target 1 being hit for +37 pips and then getting a stop out for trade 2 & 3 for +1 pip each. We have a candle close in the box at 13:45 GMT but the next candle spikes up and triggers a long trade. We were hoping the long would continue, but it does not and stops us out for -180 pips (-60 x 3 trades). Now we close out those trades and immediately enter 3 new trades  using a multiplier of 2. Normally at this point we hope that we can get down to a target 2 which would guarantee we recoup our loss. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen as we only get +74 pips back at target 1 before we retrace and then trade 2 & 3 get closed out for +2 pips each. We get another candle that closes in the box at 19:30 GMT and another short trade opportunity triggers on the next candle. You can now go to a multiplier of 5 here if you choose, but since we're still within the same trading day and we still haven't recouped our loss, it would be safer to stay at a multiplier of 2 as the London session has closed and the U.S. market is the only session open. The price shoots up a little and actually bounces off the 38.2 fib from the big downswing we just had. I'm thinking this should be a good continuation trade and we'll get our money back but it takes a drastic upturn and stops us out again for a -360 pip loss (-60 x 3 trades x multiplier of 2). Since we are past 01:00 GMT, we do not enter any new trades, so we'll wait until the new box forms. Since we did not recoup all of our losses back with a multiplier of 2, we open the next set of trades at a multiplier of 5. When going into the next day's box, you have a better chance for catching the early breakout, that's why I bump up the multiplier. Things finally work in our favor and we go all the way through all 3 targets. Any new trading opportunities now start back to normal lot sizes. Let's see how this panned out;

Trade 1= +37

Trade 2= +1

Trade 3= +1

Running Total= +39

Trade 1= -60

Trade 2= -60

Trade 3= -60

Running Total= -141

Trade 1= +74 (+37 x 2)

Trade 2= +2 (+1 x 2)

Trade 3= +2 (+1 x 2)

Running Total= -63

Trade 1= -120 (-60 x 2)

Trade 2= -120 (-60 x 2)

Trade 3= -120 (-60 x 2)

Running Total= -423

Trade 1= +165 (+33 x 5)

Trade 2= +355 (+71 x 5)

Trade 3= +540 (+108 x 5)

Final Total= +637

This goes to show you that you can't give up, even after a couple of reversals. This can show everyone that a calculated martingale money management can work, especially if you are watching several pairs to help offset losses from other pairs that are waiting to recoup those losses.

Best way to check is to open your MarketWatch and compare it to GMT time. I use Qlock and compare it to London, England. Just download the free version right below the solid line under the paid versions.

What is your GMT+2 settings for indicator? (start time,end time, session end time..)

Another answer for martingale multiplier. 0.1, 0.2, 0.5... How to continue?

Thanks for system.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I closed all my open accounts at the end of the green box to better focus on the upcoming trading session.

My total overnight trade results (FXDD):

GJ = +122 pips

EU = +18 pips

GU = -45 pips

EJ = +30 pips

UCad = +17 pips

Net profit = +142 pips

YMMV. I guess the official rule is to let these trades run either to SL or TP. If profits were negative or a small positive profit, I would likely let the trade run. But, I think last night's position already had its chance, and besides, I like to book the profits rather than let them get erased by retracements. Like...I wouldn't be happy with +142 pips every night?

Good trading!

BC

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Anyone trade any other currency pairs, or have different results from my post?

I did incorporate Martingale one time each for EU and UCad.

I will compare my early closeout to that of letting all the trades run to SL or TP. The results will prove interesting. Do you think my position would have been better to wait, or better to close at the end of the green box? Hands, please! You sir, wearing a monacle in the back row of the room...

Yes... I already had qlock, and my time is/was in alignmment with yours.

Hello mer

I like your trading method.

To ease understanding, as I am a newbie, can you tell me which broker or MT4 you use?

Using same platform, this will align with your explanation and clarification for me to understand (sorry English is not my main language)

Thanks

The indicator's default is GMT +0, so if your GMT +2 you just add 2 hours to each time and you'll be set. You'll want to leave the multipliers the same, just change your lot sizes instead.

Bobcat, you may trade however you feel comfortable. For testing purposes and to show results, I'll be letting the open trades run until targets are hit or stopped out.

It will really be 6 of one, half a dozen of the other. You will always see results where it was beneficial to close early and times when it's not.

tpat, I am using FXCBS for all my examples. They are GMT +2 so make sure to add 2 hours to all of the times in the parameters. If you have a favorite broker already, you can use them as well with properly adjusted times in the indicator's parameters. The only thing is I may show a box size of 30 pips and it may show 32 pips on a different broker due to having a different feed, but that's not a big issue.

Here is the current results for the Eur/Usd.

The pair initiated a short trade at 09:15 GMT and closed out upon the reversal for a -162 pip loss at 16:00 GMT. New long trades were placed immediately using a multiplier of 2. Trade 1 has closed out for +66 pips (+33 x 2), leaving us with a running total of -96 pips. Trades 2 & 3 are still active at this times. Again, if we get to Target 2, we will have recouped our loss plus added +112 pips to the bank. We could possibly end up with up to +262 pips if Target 3 is reached.

just to ask if someone noticed that..

at 7:00 am GMT often happens a turn around for 30-50 pips...mostly on every pair

--- 帖子 #28 ---
i would like to share something easy and amazing..

here is eurusd chart..

draw three vertical lines:

22:00 GMT

23:45 GMT

07:00 GMT

from 22 to 23:45 is our box

draw a trendline from 22 to 07 : write down distance in pips..

now draw symmetric trendline (still from 22) with same distance in pips...

upward diagonal is for sell only , downward for buy only...

now continue zigzag up to 3 buylines /sell lines..

so max 3 entries.. (generally it doesnt go further for the day

entries always at half of a trendline...

ie: if safe sell => exit wld be next point of the buyline

stop loss as shown

just look at usjpy or usdchf.. todat ...we re at 3rd entry now ..didnt break yet...

why we need 23:45? ok it s just showing our opening of the day.. price one day or anoher will try to retrace to this level (our box).. so just keep an eye..(ie USDJPY yesterdays box low... now price retraced to this box...)

mistersimple, don't take any offense here, because I do appreciate the info, but we're starting to get off track from the original strategy already and we're only on page 3! Please, if you are wanting to post different strategies or ideas, open a different thread and post them there so not to confuse anyone on this thread, thank you.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

A few more examples I want to cover involve knowing what to do with open trades that continue into the next box. We had a perfect example from yesterday on the Eur/Jpy. After a successful start we had a re-entry at 15:45 GMT. Price then ranged for the remainder of the day until after the new box formed this morning. If I need to open new trades while there are still open trades running, I just open the new trades at the same multiplier that is used on the current trades that are running, in this case there was no multiplier used from yesterday, so it would be just like starting fresh. If the current running trades from yesterday continue to any target or stop, we close those trades out like we normally would. If you hit a stop like we did this morning at 09:00 GMT, we must wait for a valid re-entry or a new box before we can add the multiplier. Luckily, a re-entry presented itself at 10:30 GMT and now we can use our multiplier of 2 to recoup the losses. We ended up with a perfect run up to Target 3 and now we can start fresh on the next re-entry or when new box forms. Here is what we would have made from last night til today:

Yesterday

Trade 1= +38

Trade 2= +1

Trade 3= +1

Running Total= +40

Trade 1= open

Trade 2= open

Trade 3= open

Today

(Used the same multiplier as we used on the open

trades from yesterday)

Trade 1= +23 (09:00 GMT)

Trade 2= +1 (10:15 GMT)

Trade 3= +1 (10:15 GMT)

Running Total= +65

(Yesterday's open trades were stopped out right before Trade 1 above was closed.)

Trade 1= -62

Trade 2= -62

Trade 3= -62

Running Total= -121

(Valid re-entry emerged at 10:30 GMT using a

multiplier of 2)

Trade 1= +46 (+23 x 2)

Trade 2= +98 (+49 x 2)

Trade 3= +148 (+74 x 2)

Final Total= +171 pips

Hi Mer,

I had another successful evening trading with this system. My thanks again to you.

How did you determine the 3 profit levels? I need the math to enter into my own spreadsheet, as I use the FXDD chart, but I trade with Oanda.

Thanks,

BC

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I glad your having success with this, good for you. The Targets 1 and 3 are simply Fibonacci extensions and Target 2 is just Target 1 + Target 3 divided in half. I used these extensions as Target 1 is prone to reversals and if  Target 1 becomes breached, we have a good chance to reach Target 3, mainly due to the characteristics of natural Fibonacci movements.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

My next example is on the Eur/Usd from last night, so I can kill two birds with one stone and give you my results and another example like the post above. To keep you updated from yesterday, The pair initiated a short trade at 09:15 GMT and closed out upon the  reversal for a -162 pip loss at 16:00 GMT. New long trades were placed  immediately using a multiplier of 2. Trade 1 had closed out for +66 pips  (+33 x 2), leaving us with a running total of -96 pips. Trades 2 & 3 were still active at this time.

Now we are in the same predicament as the Eur/Jpy was because we now have a new box formed and the open trades have not closed out yet. Not to worry though, we just follow what we did when we traded the Eur/Jpy. We open all new trades using the last multiplier used on the current open trades. We had two setups opened at 08:15 and 12:00 GMT that occurred before the running trades were closed, so each of those setups were able to use a multiplier of 2 as well. Trade 2 from yesterday hit Target 2 at 12:00 GMT, right after the 2nd setup was triggered. Trade 3 from yesterday was still active, but never reached Target 3 and was closed out from the reversal at 14:15 GMT. There were 2 more re-entry setups after the trades from yesterday finally closed. Since we had already recouped any previous losses, we started back from the beginning with no multiplier for these trades. Here is how we did from yesterday til now:

Yesterday

Trade 1= -54

Trade 2= -54

Trade 3= -54

Running Total= -162

Trade 1= +66 (+33 x 2)

Trade 2= open

Trade 3= open

Running Total= -96

Today

(Used the same multiplier of 2 as we used on the open

trades from yesterday)

Trade 1= +42 (+23 x 2)

Trade 2= +2 (+1 x 2)

Trade 3= +2 (+1 x 2)

Running Total= -50

Trade 1= +42 (+23 x 2)

Trade 2= +2 (+1 x 2)

Trade 3= +2 (+1 x 2)

Running Total= -4

(Yesterday's open trades (Trades 2 & 3) were stopped out after the trade setups above were opened)

Trade 2= +142 (+71 x 2)

Trade 3= +66 (+33 x 2)

Running Total= +204

(Valid re-entry emerged at 14:15 GMT using no multiplier)

Trade 1= +23

Trade 2= +1

Trade 3= +1

Running Total= +229 pips

(Valid re-entry emerged at 19:30 GMT using no multiplier)

Trade 1= +23

Trade 2= +1

Trade 3= +1

Final Total= +254 pips

*Update*

We had another re-entry at 21:15 GMT. Since it was opened and closed before the new box has formed, I will add it to today's totals.

Trade 1= +23

Trade 2= +1

Trade 3= +1

Updated Total= +279

Another thing I wanted to point out, on the previous versions of the indicator we had a red box appear which told us the box was too big to safely make a trade. In this version, we are not concerned how big the box is, but how small the box is. On the Usd/Cad we have a red box meaning that the box is at or below our minimum box size we set in our parameters. This can be traded like any other night but I would advise to cut your lot sizes in half because:

A) The pip distance between your Entry Point and Target 1 are smaller and can get eaten up by the spreads.

B) Since the box size itself is so small, your multiplier can really ramp up quickly if you hit a ranging period right in the middle of the box.

As you can see we still made a lot of pips (+209 pips to be exact), but look at the candle at 15:00 GMT. Because of the size of the box with such a large candle, we actually had two setups on the same candle. Luckily, the spike down caught Target 1 before the big jump to the upside.

Again, I'm not saying you can't trade these boxes, but try and at least lower your risk by lowering the size of your lots accordingly.

Not a problem, it does sound interesting though and you might get a lot of discussion on it.

Thank you mer071898 for sharing with us an easy to understand and very interesting system. I was just wondering how you find the risk of trading 5 pairs with martingale method? Isn't there a risk of them all getting stopped out and the lots piling up at the same time instead of helping to offset losses from other pairs? Or do you find that this hardly ever happen? Would it maybe be safer for the ones of us with a weaker heart to focus on one better performing pair (which in your experience would this be?), but with a slightly larger lot size? What is your experience in this?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
First and foremost, I've always highly suggested that if you are going to take on any martingale type of strategy, you must first be properly funded to allow for the type of drawdowns you may experience. Yes there is always that risk out there that all the pairs may show losses at the same time, but to calculate the odds of all 5 pairs going 4-5 levels into the multiplier is astronomical I'm sure. I believe that spreading your trades across multiple pairs will accomplish 2 things:

1) Spreads the risk across more pairs which in turn allows you to sustain your equity in case you have a pair or two that is in heavy drawdown by offsetting it with the profits from the other pairs until it can recover. For example, obviously if you have loaded up on 6-7 pairs of Jpy (Usd/Jpy, Eur/Jpy, Gbp/Jpy, etc...) you are putting yourself at a higher risk due to the correlation of the pairs, remember where one goes, the others will follow. As long as you mix up the pairs and not use too many correlated pairs, you should be fine.

2) Profits, plain and simple. The more pairs that you can trade on without sacrificing your balance in the account, the faster you can build that account and use the equity to your advantage. I can safely use the sequence of the multipliers because I have enough capital to trade them safely with minimal risk to my account. Keep in mind that you can derive any multiplier sequence that your mind can come up with. It can more aggressive if you have a larger account or less aggressive on smaller accounts.

You obviously do not want to trade a $1 or $2k account by starting out with .1 lots because even if you are trading 1 pair and,  for example, are already up to a multiplier of 4, you will have 2.1 lots on the table which is way too risky. But by trading .01 lots you would only be risking .21 lots total instead which is still risky, but doable. This strategy is really meant to be used with a small starting lot size (unless you have unlimited capital to spare) and to slowly build your account, not make you an overnight millionaire.

Let's say you trade $10K account with just the 5 pairs I'm looking at and use only .01 lots (or $.10 a pip) as a base lot size. Now lets say each pair averages 50 pips a day (which is very feasible with this strategy), that's 250 pips a day (50 x 5 pairs) and take that times 5 trading days in a week and we would have 1250 pips a week. Now take that times 52 weeks in a year, we get 65,000 pips. Take that times $.10 a pip and we get $6500 or 65% return on your money. If you ask any REAL traders about what percentage in a year is considered a good return, most will say 20-30%. Even if you only averaged 25 pips a day, you'd still get a 32.5 % return for the year. After 2-3 years, you should be able to safely move up your lot size with the added equity you've built up. Sorry to be so long winded, but I hope that answers your questions.

Thank you mer071898 for taking the time to answer my question and giving some good advice. Very well explained and seems like a sensible approach to a Martingale system. What I particularly like with your system is that it is so mechanical.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hello Mer and Squalou,

Do you let the remaining trades open until TakeProfit or StopLoss is reached or do you stopped 'em out at the beginning of the new other box (or at partial profit) from your experience ?

Mer, Have you been experimenting with this strategy a lot and realize it was profitable or is this still under heavy investigation (basically asking if you trade this live)?

If I have the time this Week-End, I will modify the original EA I wrote for the original strategy and I could provide a backtest on 2008-2009-2010 with the dukascopy datasets (tick accuracy of 99%). Are you interested in me posting the backtest ?

regards,

--- 帖子 #42 ---
mer,

Ok...I want to spread my risk over multiple currency pairs as per your recommendation. In your 1st post, you mention you are watching 5 pairs: Eur/Usd, Gbp/Usd, Eur/Jpy, Usd/Cad, and Gbp/Jpy.

Do you consider these 5 pairs as the optimum blend of risk diversification based on your statement in the last post?

Thanks,

BC

For testing purposes, I am letting the open trades go until either a target is hit or we get stopped out, even if it goes past the new box. If you feel more comfortable to close out trades early, you are more than welcome to adjust it however you desire.

This version was developed purely by accident. I was realizing that the original strategy was not producing the results I wanted, so I went back and was taking a hard look at past charts using the old strategy and a light bulb went off and it just hit me. I did some brainstorming with my buddy who is very proficient with Fibonacci rules and here we are. He and I have only been developing this for only a few weeks. I will never trade live until I'm absolutely positive the strategy is sound. I also am waiting to see what sqaulou comes up with regarding an EA as this will need a lot of screen time if you are trading it manually. So far everything is okay, but it will definitely need more forward testing first.

I'm not sure how far along sqaulou is with his EA, it's a little more complicated than the original strategy, but you know what I always say, two heads are better than one. Let us know how it goes.

Yes, diversification is important, but there are other factors to consider like spreads, daily range, volatility, and so on. These happen to be my favorite pairs to watch. Just make sure to change the minimum box size on pairs with a larger spread like Gbp/Jpy for example.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi. Here is an example how you can get 99% tick accuracy. It works fine for me too.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I know I said I would just show current chart results for Eur/Usd, but I wanted to give a total of the possible pips that could've been made last week for each pair following the strategy rules in post #1 (spreads not included). Any of the trades made on Friday were followed until closed or stopped out. The two pairs that weren't traded on the 21st of July below were over my 100-120 pip limit and were big losers (that's why there are rules in place!).

Eur/Usd- +770 pips

Gbp/Usd- +578 pips (July 21st-box over 120 pips)

Eur/Jpy- +1207 pips

Usd/Cad- +812 pips

Gbp/Jpy- +1243 pips (July 21st-box over 120 pips)

Grand Total= +4,610 pips

That's an average of 922 pips per pair for the week and an average of 184.4 per pair per day. And that is with no trades being taken on two pairs on July 21st due to their extremely large box size.

Dear mer071898

Thanks for this system

and i need your help about that:

I need simple way to got inter with pending orders buy and sell with stop loss and targets , so the sell may activate and hit target or stop whatever, or the the  buy will activate. and  i will open chart tommorow and put the next order and so on.

so is this will be profitable?

and what is your recommendation

another quiestion what is the best pair couse i preffere to use one pair.

Thank you alot

What does your "100-120 pip limit" refer to?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Mer,

great thread!

Regarding your GMT offset, I found out that your FXCBS account must be GMT+3 (you said earlier it is +2), because my FxPro account is GMT+3 too and I have set box start/end time to 07:00 to 10:00 for having the same picture as your screenshots.

So either your offset for FXCBS/screen shot is wrong OR the default box time has to be GMT 04:00 to 07:00 (instead of GMT 05:00 to 08:00)...

Could you please check and comment on my findings?

Thankx.

Hi,

I am sorry for this very basic technical question but when I try to download the indicator it shows as php attachment and after download it does not show on the MT4 platform. Please advice

Thanks

Jill

Follow up, I tried to download again and it worked well. Thanks if someone fixed it

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Well, I'm sure the EA that squalou is working on will place and close orders for you, but it is not finished yet. Maybe check in the Platform Tech section, maybe someone has a script that will work or someone can code a script for you. As for which pair is best, that's hard to say. According to last weeks results in post #45, Eur/Jpy and Gbp/Jpy stand out, but next week they may not.

It means that we do not trade on any pair that has a box size larger than 100-120 pips. I use 100 pips on everything except Gbp/Jpy which I use 120 pips. I had squalou take that out of the indicator, but I'm going to have him put that back in to help filter the trades. We are going to add a optional twist to it, but we have to evaluate it first.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Remember, we are still on British Summer Time, which is currently GMT +1, so any broker that is normally at GMT +3 in reality, is now GMT +2.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Just to be clear here:-

Most London based Brokers work on London (UK) time.

This means that in the winter they work on GMT.

In the Summer they work on GMT + 1 hour. Their day starts at 23:00 GMT the day before.

There are exceptions. I trade with Alpari UK (2 Demo - 2 Live accounts). To avoid the one Hour of Sunday trading that London time brokers use they work on CET (Central European Time) which is normally GMT +1 and GMT +2 in summer. So I have 5 clear days charts.

There are several Cyprus based Brokers who are normally on GMT +2 but now (Daylight Savings Hours / Summer Time) they are on GMT +3.

In the USA Eastern Standard Time is GMT - 5 Hours.

Eastern Daylight Saving Time is GMT - 4 Hours.

Just for fun the time changes are made at a different time in the month to Europe and the UK.

Every forum that I visit has this problem. Most people outside and some inside the UK think that London or UK time is GMT. Although for 6 months they share the same actual time, the names are different. GMT and BST (British Summer Time).

Places that do not use daylight saving Time, for example The UAE, always keep the same time difference from GMT all year. But of course their time is different by 1 hour to all the countries that do make the change for a period of 6 months. No wonder that it causes problems!

Going back to the Indicator, I to had to alter my time away from the ones quoted to make them match with those posted on the Thread.

Excellent System, keep up the good work.

Best Regards

--- 帖子 #53 ---
thank u  mer071898

what you think

i will enter two trades on 8 oclock one is buy an the other is sell, and close the chart and go.

so one of them will activate the other will not, depending on trend move.

without multiplying and with one contract because my balance is still little yet

will it be profitable?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I would not trade this live as of yet, there's still a lot of forward testing to be done. But if your are determined, I would use the smallest lot size your broker allows. It is best to place 3 trades, but if you are just placing 1 trade, make sure to move your stops up at each target level. You can decide not to use the multipliers if you want to, but it will make it much more difficult to recover losses if you don't.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I agree completely, every thread that has an EA or indicator with time settings will have these issues, so if you are having trouble with lining up the times correctly, look at my chart examples and just change the times manually so they look similar and just save it as a template.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
mer,

I am currently trading all 5 pairs that you are watching @ $0.01 per pip on Oanda.

Would you consider this a "bad" trading day for this sytem? I would, simply because no currency pair has made it to TP2, yet. That indicates a ranging market, to me.

My problem with trading this, so far, has been my inability to be awake to increase the Martingale lot sizes after losses.

For the bad news, at one time, I was running -467 pips overall. GU "cable" has been the profit killer.

The good news is that this scenario has now improved to only -29 pips overall. Some of the trades have closed out with wins, others with losses. I will let the current trades run to SL or TP and report back with the final results.

YMMV. My results are/will not be official because I haven't been able to implement the Martingale strategy. I plan to use a bit more conservative Martingale when applicable in the future. I may choose to reduce the number of currency pairs traded, but I like the idea of evening out the odds across a number of currency pairs.

If only I hadn't traded GU, today!

You have to understand that you're not going to get perfect setups everyday, in fact a perfect setup occurs only 15-20% of the time. But just like the situation we had in post #12, we were down -423 pips at one point and ended end with +637 pips the by the end of the next day. You must be patient as I warned everyone in the first post that there is an inherent risk with using martingale strategies, and that risk is heavy drawdowns until we get our recovery. Does Oanda's platform have the ability to send e-mails to your phone or the ability to set price alerts? I have my platform send me an alert to my phone if I'm not home and I also set up price alerts when the price renters my box so I can be aware of retraces and re-entries.

Jillsaab, I understand your concern and where you're coming from, but you did realize that on 3 out of 4 of your pics that you hit your Target 1 first, right?  Just kidding with you , but what your seeing is the early trading after the bell until the real breakout occurs. The main point I was trying to convey on the first page is that in the original strategy, we were using the Target 1 as an entry point and we would get reversals almost immediately after our Entry triggered, which was frustrating to say the least. So that's why we took the original entry point and made it a Target instead. Also, those quick reversals can be a good thing and I'll show you an example:

In this Eur/Gbp chart we have a short entry triggered and an immediate reversal (which went to Target 3). Let's say the short entry never appeared, what did we earn?

Target 1= +14

Target 2= +30

Target 3= +45

Total pips= +89 pips

Now, let's calculate what we would've made including the short entry and the reversal we see in the chart originally:

Target 1= -23

Target 2= -23

Target 3= -23

Running Total= -69

Target 1= +28 (+14 x 2)

Target 2= +60 (+30 x 2)

Target 3= +90 (+45 x 2)

Total pips= +109

You actually made more money using the reversal the with having a straight run up to Target 3. I guess what I'm saying is don't be too concerned with the immediate reversals if they happen because you will end up making more in the long run.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Just an update for the Eur/Usd. We have a fairly large box and have triggered a short trade at 09:00 GMT. Heavy ranging has us in a stall for now. All we can do is wait til we get a definitive direction, so all trades are active as of this post. the Eur/Jpy and Gbp/Jpy are both already at Target 1. Usd/cad is also at a stall with a long setup that was triggered and is currently active. If you are watching Gbp/Usd, this is already at a multiplier of 5 with 2 reversals from the ranging, but be patient as price is bouncing off the 76.4 fib from the last downswing and I think it might hold, so we'll have to wait this one out too.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Alright, sqaulou, our coder extraordinaire, has modified the indicator and added two new functions. Well, actually, one function was an old function that was added back in and the second one is new.

first one he added back in was the "MaxBoxSizeInPips" function. This works similar to the "MinBoxSizeInPips" parameter in that it draws a red box that says "No Trade!" when the box is over "X" number of pips. I normally choose 100 pips for everything except for Gbp/Jpy, in which I use 120 pips. the reason it will suggest not trading the pair is that with an extremely large box you are really pushing the daily range of the pair which makes it very difficult to reach even a Target 1. I have an example with the new function and one without so you can see the difference.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Now the new function is called the "LimitBoxToMaxSize". What it allows us to do on occasions where the standard box size is too large, is it limits the tradable box size to "X" number of pips. The indicator will then calculate and center the box based on the median EMA comprised of the 12 bars of the box. that way we start with a box that is not too wide, but properly centered. A great couple of examples where we could have used this were on July 21st on the Gbp/Usd and the Gbp/Jpy. By setting the parameter to TRUE, and using a 60 pip limit on everything except Gbp/Jpy, which I used a 75 pip limit, we were able to take two days that were deemed unable to trade due to their box size and turn them into very profitable days. I posted some pics to show the differences.

If you want to use the indicator like normal, leave the "LimitBoxToMaxSize" parameter set to "FALSE". If you set it to "TRUE" make sure to adjust the "MaxBoxSizeInPips" parameter to whatever you think would be a tradable box size. I have mine set to "TRUE" and a max box size of 60 pips except for Gbp/Jpy, which is at 75 pips. I have attached the indicator to post #1.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
mer,

I downloaded the new indicator. It appears identical to the old setup. The "LimitBoxToMaxSize" parameter does not appear for me. I downloaded it twice just to make sure...

Hi Bobcat 2.

If you are still having a problem opening v2 try this.

For example only. Open a new GBPGPY 15 Min chart.

Do not load V2.

Open your London Breakout template.

Right click the screen.

Open the indicators tab.

Delete 3 Tier london Breakout.

Now insert the V2.

The GBPGPY should show examples of the restricted box in action.

The old template contains instructions to load the old EA as well as the indicators. Once loaded it stops you loading another version until it is removed.

great work boys

what i want to say about the falls break outs

it got my attention too

and it,s easy to now when thats happening first with price action

its the high of that candle

its the second high from the open

its wich you must read where th e falls break out could happen

int the box your trading in from the former trading day

thats what i think correct me when i am wrong

Hi packgreen49,

As Mer  does not appear to be here just now I will throw in my 2 Cents.

Once the box has been drawn at your box closing time nothing should change regarding the 3 Tier London breakout  indicator.

My 5 charts remain the same all day.

It sounds as if you have some form of coflict such as 2 versions of the indicator trying to operate on your chart.

Or possibly another indicator or EA for closing or managing your trades?

The quickest way to reset, I think, is to right click the chart, open indicators, then highlight the indi and click edit. Then without editing just close the popups and the indi will reset.

Yes, you're right. I hope everyone understands that this is why we forward test first and make our tweaks and changes before we ever think of going live.

Hello Mer

I just finished your thread and I have a feeling you are very good indeed a trader.

I will have to re-read some of your trading guides in order to fully understand well, particularly...

...the re-entries that are not closed for the day that carried forward to the next day (I term it "yesterday" entries),

... and come to the next day, new entries will have to make (I term it "today" entires),

and such "yesterday" vs "today" entries are making me "confusing" to keep track.

I think such re-entires are made to ensure we profit from our trades, correct?

p.s. Ops... sorry, I am a newbie and English i not my main language.

Allow me to ask:

1. Which pairs you will advise to start with using London Brk v.2?

2. Can I use this trading method on H1 tf?

M15 tf requires often check backs, but I am in a full time work.

Thanks for your time and sharing.

Pls. keep up posting.

I appreciate the comments. First question, you can use whatever pairs you like as long as you adjust your minimum and maximum box sizes to allow for the various spreads. You can always start out with the pairs I am using in post #1 or you may choose your own. I feel that this strategy will work best on pairs with a low spreads but have a higher average daily range so we get our movement needed to reach our targets. Question 2, This method is really designed for a 15 minute timeframe. I have not heard of anyone being able to use it on anything higher, but you are always welcome to experiment on your own to see if it is feasible.

Basically, when I have a trade that carries over til the next day, I only place new trades at the same multiplier and lot size as the remaining open trades were placed at. On the open trades, you can just put in your target price and let them go until they reach target or stop out. If you're not able to be at your screen for re-entries or to move stops, MT4 can set up price alerts that can be configured to be sent to an e-mail address or to your cell phone's e-mail address (every carrier has one). That way you could hop on the computer and close trades, adjust stops, or even place new trades.

Thanks for the comments and I'm glad you can get some use from the info I post for everyone. I will still glance at my Murrey strategy once in a while but have only taken very strong setups only.

I don't know what the New York box time is as this was designed for the London open, but if you know what the London open time is on MB, just add 5 hour to it and you'll have the New York open.

can this indi code into ea with trailing stop function?

sqaulou is still working on the EA, but I don't know if any trailing stop parameters are being added.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Okay, I hope everyone has been able to play around with the new version of the indicator and test out some different settings. This week I will be testing out the new indicator with some new settings to see if we can get away from the larger boxes but still keep the targets reachable without losing our profitability. First off, in the parameters, I will start by using a "LimitBoxToMaxSize" input set to True and I will be using a "MaxBoxSizeInPips" of 50 on all pairs except Gbp/Jpy, which I will use a value of 55.

Just to make things quicker, Target 1, 2, & 3 will be abbreviated as T1, T2, & T3. Black boxes are entry points, Red boxes are trades stopped on reversals, and Blue boxes are Targets (please remember that when a Target 2 is hit and price reverses back to Target 1, Target 1 is basically your Target 3 or T3 in this case since we have moved the stop).

So let's get started with last nights results.

Eur/Usd

T1= -32

T2= -32

T3= -32

Running Total= -96 pips

T1= +40 (+20 x 2)

T2= +84 (+42 x 2)

T3= +130 (+65 x 2)

Final Total= +158 pips

Gbp/Usd (Max Box Size limited to 50 pips)
T1= +31

T2= +65

T3= +100

Final Total= +196 pips

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Usd/Cad (Caution due to small box size)

T1= +15

T2= +31

T3= +15

Final Total= +61 pips

Eur/Jpy

T1= +24

T2= +50

T3= +76

Final Total= +150 pips

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Gbp/Jpy (Max Box Size limited to 55 pips)

T1= +34

T2= +72

T3= +110

Final Total= +216 pips

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Overall a great day with only one reversal and stop out on the Eur/Usd (which still turned around for a nice profit on the recovery).

Eur/Usd- +158 pips

Gbp/Usd- +196 pips

Usd/cad- +150 pips

Eur/Jpy- +161 pips

Gbp/Jpy- +216 pips

Grand total for Monday- +881 pips

Looks like the new input has already made a difference on the Gbp/Jpy and Gbp/Usd.

Hello Mer,

Thanks.

Thanks guys, I don't think it is the best strategy out there, but I would consider it "Good". To be honest, if it didn't have to incorporate the martingale multipliers, which makes it a little more risky, then I would rank it up there with the top strategies.

authornumber, I don't know what size account or what lot sizes you're using but I would highly suggest not trading this live until we have tested it properly. Now, I know it's your money and you can do with it what you want, but I would feel bad if you blow a live account on a strategy that is still being tested.

We will not be do any more changes to the indicator, but to get your TP levels where you want, change the inputs of the "TP1Factor" and "TP3Factor" parameters to get your desired result. Understand though, a 10 pip TP1 is going to get eaten up pretty quick by the spreads and you're leaving a lot of pips on the table. The stoploss in totally up to the trader and with a 10 stop, you will get stopped out quite a bit and the multipliers will ramp up very quickly. There is no stoploss in the indicator, we just visually use the opposite side of the Entry Point as our stoploss. All you have to do is enter the stoploss into your trades when you place them and find a trade management EA or script to move them for you.

If you are still wanting to specific changes made, you would have to get in contact with squalou to see if he would take the time to make those specific changes to the indicator or to the EA before he gets it completed.

Will there be an option to turn off the martingale multiplier in the ea? I agree this is a great system, and it doesn't need the martingale. My biggest problem was the 3am (EST) time for the box to form. After playing around with it a bit, I've gotten good results with the e/j with a box from 5pm-11pm EST (I believe that 22:00-4:00gmt). I can place one buy order and one sell order at 11pm, then manually re-enter if necessary after 7am til noon. Max box size 75 set to true, also added break even stop at +30 for 75 pip boxes, or +25 for smaller boxes, which gave better results.

I have manually back tested this from Jan of 2009 (although admittedly there is room for human error), but it made an average of 1300 pips per month in 2009 without the martingale. This year was not as good but still profiting an average of 500 pips per month in 2010.  This is only on the e/j pair, one set of 3 buy and one set of 3 sell orders opened at 11pm, and re-entries only from 7am til noon.  I also tried it with every trade from 11pm til noon the next day but it was not as good.

I don't really have time to do the calculations for a martingale strategy. I do agree it can bring in higher pips overall, but you have to have a large account and start off with very small lots, to be able to cover the margin requirements (plus extra) for all the multipliers if you have a few losing trades. So even with the extra pips it might bring in, I would have to do comparisons to see if it actually brings in more money, or if it is more profitable to start with larger lots that are more in line with your account size and just take your losses when they come.  This strategy seems to be very profitable without the martingale, but the box times and sizes will have be adjusted for different pairs.  An ea will come in really handy for testing!

Attaching a nice script I found for placing 3 buy and 3 sell pending orders, seems tailor-made for this system.

I agree it is great system but not good for those who go to work from 7:30 am till 4:00 pm that is 03:30 am - 01:00 pm GMT. I will just miss it.

Is it possible to make an excel sheet taking into consideration equity and then calculating the lot size, projected profit etc based on risk. The sheet can be further advanced on calculating the lot size in case where stop loss is hit and we have to escalate the lot size.

This is great great strategy!!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I'm not sure if squalou is planning to make the martingale optional, but you could always message him and ask. I am glad to see you are able to use the basis of the strategy and adapt it to your own style of trading. I don't force anyone to use the martingale part of the strategy, it's just what I'd use because when it comes time to go live, I have the capital to take advantage of using the martingale safely. Remember that I mentioned before that this is not a "try to double our account every month" type of strategy, it is meant to build the account slowly, hence the smaller lot sizes.

Awesome find, thanks. I'm sure this will come in handy for those who are not comfortable using an EA.

That sounds like a great idea, but I'm clueless when it comes to excel documents and spreadsheets. If anyone wants to step up and tackle something like that, I'm sure everyone would greatly appreciate it.

Those are incredible results Mer.  I have been following your previous systems as well, and this is a quantum leap forward.  Thanks for you hard work.

CelticHeart-

The script is producing an error when I am attempting to place the orders:

"ERROR #4109: trade is not allowed in the expert properties"

Can you advise?

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Mer,

thanks for sharing this trading system

Are you still moving SL to BEP+1 for T2 dan T3, once T1 hit TP?

If so, this trade will produce T1= +34, T2=+1, T3=+1, Total +36 pips instead of +140 in your calculation.

See my below illustration.

At point 1: T1 hit TP and then T2 & T3 move SL to BEP+1.

At point 2: Both T2 & T3 hit SL at BEP+1.

Do I understand correctly? Please CMIIW..

CelticHeart-

"ERROR #4109: trade is not allowed in the expert properties"

Thanks in advance.[/quote]

I think that error usually occurs when you don't have the box checked to allow live trading in your expert advisor settings.  Go to Tools/Options/Expert advisors and check the following boxes (leave the others unchecked):

Enable Expert Advisors (except for Custom Indicators and Scripts)

Allow Live Trading

Allow DLL imports

Allow external experts imports

If that's not the problem, I will look into it more.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I did not create the script, but I think the only order types it allows are buy stops and sell stops. I didn't change any of the settings for order type when I tried out the script.  What is the order you're trying to place that gave you invalid stops?

Hi,

I manually backesting April Month on EUR/USD

Starting from 0.01 lot

Account balance is 10 000 USD

The net profit is approx : 2500 pips (exclude spreads)

Max drawdown : 4%

I use only 1 double lot a day (ex: 0,01 loose => 0,02 loose => if same day 0,02 ...).

By using this settings is used a maximum of 0.32 lot.

Excuse my bad english.

For any question, you can post in the thread.

Hi Mer!

First, thank you this great strategy!

I have a little problem, please see the picture. Today, GBP/JPY, MaxBoxSizeInPips: 50, but the the box size on the chart is only 48p. I don't know why. Can you help me?

And the last question: Have you information when come the EA?

Thank you for your time!

Dear all

Please see attached the breakout excel sheet I wanted for this great strategy and let me know how you think about this. Feel free to input your creative ideas and update/correct. I have only initiated and I know that our excellent forum members can modify it to very superior levels. I think the column with leverage needs some correction as it do not reflect the right amount but quite close to the used margin. I am not sure why this is. Dear tech members please please do give your valuable inputs.

Finally I have figured out the way to protect the formulas so you have to just enter your starting equity, your risk level, entry price, TP and SL price. I have used leverage of 1:100 in this sheet and the pairs that can be used have price format of X.XXXXX

Thanks and happy PIPIING

Jill

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanx for reply Mer,

I agree with you but my idea was to reduce TP levels to increase probability of hitting them. This is the main problem of this system - the higher TP are the lower is probability of hitting them. We have to find the balance. I have been thinking a lot but no result so far http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif  how to determin if break out will be big and hit TP. Maybe any indicator may help. Any ideas guys?

Again, this is what I like to see, traders adjusting the strategy to fit their needs, well done.

To be honest, I don't know. If you look at my Gbp/Jpy in the pic below, everything is normal. Maybe try reloading the template on the pair to see if that fixes it. otherwise sqaulou may have to chime in on this one.

Again that is something we would have to ask sqaulou if it can be added.

Thanks, jillsaab, I sure someone will put it to good use.

I was just throwing out my opinion, but you make a valid point. Unfortunately, there is obviously no way to determine how big of a move we can get on a day to day basis. All we can do is try and find the right balance between the minimum and maximum box sizes that won't compromise the profitability of the strategy, that is why we test, test ,test, and then test some more. I think having the box limiter definitely helps with keeping us out of those huge boxes we will occasionally see from time to time, especially on the Gbp/Jpy.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
hi,

I don't get this wrong behaviour on my GJ chart.

On your chart, the box is blue, not orange, meaning that it was seen smaller than 50pips.

It seems like the highest price in the box did not include the bar you have circled in red.. ?!?

(the next highest bar is at 136.36, which matches the EntryBuy price in your box)

This is strange indeed!

I can't see why the highest bar (with high=136.45) is not taken into account in the calculation.

Sometimes i get invalid fib lines (but not boxes) when i change time frames on the chart which already has the indicator loaded.

I have to "restart" the indicator to get it right (ctrl-I, "Edit" the indicator, then just confirm with "OK" without changing any settings, then "Close").

Try this to see if it works.

Hi Mer,

thanks for your nice System!

Only for test purposis I changed a little bit the  "3 Tier" indicator, and calculate the max limit with ATR.

(ATR period=100, factor=4).

So is easier to see that every pair on every day can have different max box sizes related with the price volatility. Maybe help.

I'm rather excited about this strategy, thanks for sharing it!

The only issue I have is the time.

I live in EST time zone (GMT -5) and there's no way I can be up for the london open...

My question is this, is it possible to adjust settings such that I can enter the NY open?

Or even better, I trade between 8:00pm EST to 10:00pm EST, or 1:00am GMT to 3:00am...

Any hints/ideas would be appreciated.  Thanks!

Happy pipping!

I just wanted to pop in this thread and say a big thanks to mer071898 for providing this system to us all.

I opened a "Live" real money account with gft $5k on sunday. I'm already up $500 this week alone. Just trading Monday-Tuesday.

I will post more equity results as time goes along.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
A very useful change for those that are familiar with using ATR values, thanks. I won't be replacing the indicator in post #1 though as the indicator is exactly how I would like it to be, but thanks for the contribution. By the way, is the number in parentheses the max box size?

I appreciate the accolades, but I think I am far from deserving to be called famous, lol!!

That's the nice thing about this is that you can use the basics of the strategy however you desire. Change the inputs, times, box sizes, whatever your little heart desires. The best thing for you is to wait until sqaulou has the bugs out of the EA and you could trade the strategy off a VPS and still get your sleep.

First off, congrats! Secondly, what lot sizes are you starting off with because $5K is still a very small account for this strategy and very risky, especially if you hit a sequence like we did on the Gbp/Usd last week.

The eurusd would have worked out a little differently, but overall still profitable by 151 pips.  The first tp would not have been hit because of spread, and the stopout would have been hit due to spread

But in the end, still worked out to a little more pips, with trade 1 being stopout and trade 2 hitting all 3 tp's at multiplier 2

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Yes, that is possible, but I'm not adding in the spreads right now mainly for demonstration purposes because everyone's spreads will be different depending on which broker you use. This way everyone is on the same page when they look at the examples.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Yeah, makes things a bit easier to not account for spread for demonstrational purposes

Thank you!

The indicator is only a tool for test purposes!

- Yes, between the parantheses is the MaxBox size.

- The indicator is programmed to get around the feeling that the box size value can be.

- In the version 2 is programmed also the average calculation of the box sizes.

You can now get the box size value by multiplying the ATR value, or by dividing the box size average.

For me is obvious that every pair needs other settings...

I did some changes so that this can also be used as new york breakout box. See if this helps. Correct me if I am wrong. May be NY breakout and London break out can be done with same strategy. Please see the attached template. Of course, to use the template you need the original indicator on the first page of the thread. Please adjust the profit levels. I have reduced them a bit in the attached template.

hi all,

i have now finalized the EA coding, including the martingale sequence control (optional, default will be disabled).

I am not posting the EA right now because we are still final-testing it to make sure it is stable enough, but this should be ready very soon, possibly released today if Mer won't find last-minute issues today  .

Martingale will be like in the first version of the LBO strategy: either use a fixed sequence, the one suggested by Mer as default (which i called "aggressive" earlier), but it will be completely configurable (you will be able to change the sequence to your own).

Or use the "AutoMartingale" option, which will automatically calculate the Mart factor based on the past lost pips to recoup, taking into account all last concecutive lost trades.

Backtesting on EU from 2010.01.01 till today gives around +5000 pips profit, WITHOUT using Martingale.

($10.000 account and 0.01 lots basis for these backtests)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Using Mer's Martingale sequence gives..... +16500 pips!!!!

HOWEVER: note that the Mart factor was pushed to x233 beween june 10 and 14, due to a 6 consecutive lost trades sequence...

martingale IS VERY risky, never forget that...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Using AutoMartingale gives +10300 pips, with a max multiplier pushed "only" to x62...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

But your patience will be rewarded...

We all hope so anyway!

It seems to me that I'm getting more fakes on the breakouts when setting the max box size to 55 on GBPJPY, is it really better to have it that low on such a beast cross pair?

Thanks guys

ps. I'm loving this strategy

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I have not done any back testing with the g/j, but I got good results on  the e/j with a max 75 box size. Smaller boxes did not work as well.  This was from Jan 2009 to present. Very time-consuming to figure it all  out manually, I'm waiting for the ea to try out other settings.  I would  think the g/j would need a box size of at least 100, but can't say for  sure until it's back tested with different size settings. And possibly different box times.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Change the settings to whatever you like, I've already mentioned this numerous times that the setting are not written in stone. For testing purposes, I'm using 55.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I see, sure. Sorry about that, I kinda skipped some lines while reading through. Well, I'm just gonna use whatever you recommend. Mokey see Monkey do haha

Thanks for all the help.

ps. Love this strategy

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Nothing to be sorry for, I am just a base for everyone to work from, not to reach to. You could always open more than one of the same chart and test multiple settings at one time. That way you can go from chart to chart and see the differences together. Remember, the whole idea here is to tame the "beast", not let it run rampant.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Just an update, the EA will have to be re-worked a little. We are having an issue where the EA is not opening new trades until all open trades are finished, mainly the ones that are carried over from previous days (which is not what we want). sqaulou said this may be difficult to code, but as always, he will diligently try his best to come up with a fix. If there are any coders out there that want to chime in, please post here or give sqaulou a pm with any ideas, thanks.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Could you post the existing version as a beta? Would love to have it, as is (I bet many of us agree!). Also, then any coders out there could take a look at it for the fix. I can do a bit of coding myself. Not sure if I could help with this but would certainly give it a try.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I will check with sqaulou, if he has no objections, then we will try and get it up as soon as he knows if his fix will work.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Could you not add an expiration to the trades to close at the SessionEndTime?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
We should put you on the payroll....

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Well, that's one option we are looking at, but it's not the preferred way I'd like to close the trades. If the open trades that extend past the next day's box can't be managed by the EA, then we just might have to close all the open trades before the new box forms. The problem now in the coding is that the EA tracks the 3 trades with fixed Magic Number values, but the numbers are always the same from one series of trades to the next, that's why the EA doesn't open more than one series of trades because it's waiting for the current open trades to all close first. We're trying to see if we can code variable Magic Numbers for each series of trades and somehow manage the Magic Numbers individually.

I have been using the London Breakout EA-V4.0 for 4 weeks now and its going well. What I would like to do is alter the Buy & Sell entry levels, and alter the HalfTP & TP fib levels. I would like to enter at breakout of box and take half profit at 127 Fib level and full take profit at 138 fib level, with SL staying as is.

Sorry I know this may be off the subject, but have found the profits  small but constant at the 127 fib level with an entry at break of box  and would like the ea to do this for me.

My question is how do I and can I make these alterations to your London Breakout EA-V4.0 ? I have the London BreakoutV9.2 indicator & the London Breakout scriptV3.1 running with the ea.

Since sqaulou did the coding, it would be best to message him with what you want to accomplish.

These are the days when we have to be patient and trust that the multipliers will do their work. Hopefully, tomorrow will bring better results.

***WARNING***

Tomorrow is Non Farm Payroll, a day I normally stay away from trading, but I will place trades as normal just to see how they react to the news.

I just wanted to show you guys that having a smaller box is not always detrimental to your trading. Below I have two examples of the Gbp/Jpy, one with a 75 pips max box size and one with a 40 pip max box size. As you can see, the 40 pips box made us +150 pips while the 75 pip box lost us -129 pips. All I'm saying is don't judge the profitability by the box size alone. In reality, smaller box sizes will have a better chance of hitting targets than a larger box will.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Another good example would've been on the Gbp/Usd from last night. If we used a 35 pip box, we would only be down -33 pips at the end of the session instead of -1107 pips.

Have not really been reading around in the forums lately and then suddenly upon checking something before NFP comes out, I stumble over this thread and find my professional buddies like Mer, Swingman, Squalou, lol.

Good to read about the subject.

Will set it up over the weekend.........and looking forward to the EA.

Hi Mer,

It's great that you share your knowledge. Thanks for that!

My question to you: I'm on Pacific Standard Time and my broker is FXDD (GMT +3) in the START and END time, should it read:

Start time: 08:00

End time: 11:00

Session end time: 04:00

THanks again!

Is it possible to make some instructional youtube videos once you are all set with this strategy, I'm collecting all the resources possible for my two friends. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
hi guys,

i'm just making a quick stop here today -- other stuff to take care of right now, i'll be working on finalizing this this week-ebd, so we have some great toy to play with next week !

Friday's box is over already anyway... but market will still be there next week, don't worry

I think i have a solution to the issue: i will not change the magic numbers, but simply use the OrderOpenTime() to see if trades are current or past sessions trades, and manage them accordingly (recompute the TP1/2/3 for past session trades, or perhaps save them in the OrderComment area, so we won't need to recalc them.

That should be fairly "easy" to code.

SQ

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Good idea... I would do it...

--- 帖子 #163 ---
This has been crawling around also in the first version of the strat'...

We can see many occasions where trading in counter-trend (CT) instead of breakout (BO) would have been the better choice.

On this GU example, we would have made 3x50pips profit by selling on boxHigh and buying on boxLow.

And even when BO is more profitable then CT, CT would still be profitable that same day, even with the same BO-oriented settings.

NiceGuy had suggested that to me in the first LBO thread, and i must admit he had made a very good point... and good profit out of just trading the CT mode (manually, using the indicator as his "playground").

The big question of course is: how do we decide to go BO or CT ?...

I could add a BO/CT mode as a manual input to the EA in a first approach, just to evaluate it in testing, and possibly produce statistical results.

From the backtests i've performed so far, we are still very positive in BO-only mode (which is the only mode in the EA and the strategy right now), even with the few bad ranging days (which would be very profitable CT days).

Then we may elaborate more on the CT mode to come up with rules to select BO/CT, and CT-specific box and levels settings.

Initial CT settings rules would roughly be:

- Buy at boxLow

- Sell at boxHigh

- TP set to opposite box edge

- SL adjusted by a "SLFactor" (set to 0.618 would give a SL set to the BO TP1 level typically)

No need to send 3 trades, as we only have 1 target level: the opposite box edge.

I know we are still in early evaluation of the BO mode here, and it is probably too early to talk about CT mode, but i just wanted to put words on what many of us are silently thinking...

Let's see what our experienced traders have to suggest for selecting the BO/CT mode, and CT-mode box/levels settings...

I know it is risky but i want to know the possibilities of starting with balance of 10,000 and using 0.1 as the base lot. With your initial testing of using auto martingale mode of multiplier x 62, will the account go bust?

How bad can it be?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
My first reaction after reading about this subject again, as true, it has been discussed in the past:

the more complicated the EA becomes, the more options, the more chance of it not working as it would in simple setup.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
The AutoMart test shows a max DD of 4% for 0.01 lot and initial deposit of 10.000.

With 0.1 lot (1$/pip), this would become a 40% DD...

And would have wiped out your account if the next factor would have been a loss...

Do what I mentioned in post #19, download the clock and compare the difference between the MarketWatch time of your broker compared to the London time in the clock. If your MarketWatch is +3 from London, then you are correct.

What kind of videos are you looking for?

In my opinion, maybe the CT trades would work in a hedging type of format, maybe use a martingale approach with them as well.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
just out of curiosity, I went back through the charts for the week with sqaulou's CT idea. I used the basis he mentioned earlier for entering and closing trades below:

Initial CT settings rules would roughly be:

- Buy at box Low

- Sell at box High

- TP set to opposite box edge

- SL set to the BO TP1 level

What I did was use the same multiplier sequence used for the main strategy and ended up with 4752 pips from all 5 pairs for the week. I think if we put these two ideas together, we could have something special here. You can't argue with a possible +15516 pips for the week!

--- 帖子 #173 ---
insert pivot inside box?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Not sure what you mean. Can you elaborate?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
its just an idea..

i was thinking of cutting the box in 2 (horizontal line) ..

if BO activated and pricestarts to move in loss zone..  this pivot line = Stop and Reverse to the other edge.. in that way you zero your loss ....

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Thanks for your reply.

Looks like if i want to use 0.1 as base lot for 10,000, better not mess with AutoMart and just go without Mart multiplier.

However, greed is making too much noise.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Good Idea,

We can run simultanously CT and BO to compensate our loses. If it is not possible to write both into one EA we could run them on two separate charts.

Anyway for better testing we have to wait for Squalou to finish his work.

Rgds,

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi,

According to your testing which pair gave the best winning rates?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Just an idea:

the use of BO/CT mode is maybe related with the ACD Method by Mark Fisher.

In an old thread (http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=60172) you find in post#1,#2 few explanations, if you don't have "The Logical Trader" book.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Mer-

I don't know if this makes things more complicated.  MT4 paints its charts off the bid price by default.  I think if the box were to include the ask price at the top side and the bid at the bottom, we can prevent an order being triggered if it touches the edge of the box.

This may decrease the number of trade-able boxes due to size, but perhaps decrease some of the countertrend boxes?

thoughts?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Sorry, I just did a quick visual check of this week and was adding everything together in one total. I didn't figure up individual pairs. All you have to do is go back and look at the charts yourself to see how each pair fared for the week.

Thanks for the link, I'll give it a read.

We are just testing here, so changing the indicator is kind of a moot point. Besides, if you add in the ask price, all your doing is making the entry point higher and has nothing to do with the spread being taken from the trade by the broker. The box edge is only a basis for your entry only.

That is exactly how EA from previous thread - London Breakout EA-5.2 - is working. At the end of session time it closes/deletes buy and sell stops and leaves open positions. When next day box is formed this ea does not open new positions on the same pair. It will be great to find solution for that.

Squalou how is your work going?

Rgds.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I believe he said he might have a fix for it and is working on it as we speak.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
EVERYBODY.

The script works without flaws.

It was me that did not pay attention and finally got on track when one of my newbies complained it did not work and showed a SL error.

THAT was the solution.

FXDD live uses 4 dec, but I was testing on a FXDD demo and those have already switched per Aug. 1 to 5 dec.

Having added the extra dec, everything is ticking like a clock.

Special thanks to celticheart for trying to get it going on my platform via teamviewer.

As you see, we were VERY close, the solution was just around the corner.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Glad you have it working, maybe someone out there can fix it to work with either a 4 or 5 digit broker, any takers?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Ah, so *that* was the problem! Glad you figured it out   I had tried it on both my fxdd demo and live accounts and it worked, but my fxdd demo is still 4 dec. Maybe it's just fxdd malta that has switched?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Right, I will NEVER EVER trade forex in my life again with an USA based broker.

More then fed up with all their jokes. They claim to abide by the rules of the NFA, still move offshore as everything in the USA seems to be doing.

Don't get me wrong, in the end ALL bucketshop brokers are a headache, wherever they are located.

Now only the EA can emulate this script

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I am with you there, I can't stress how much the NFA idiots and all there FIFO and no hedging rules have really dragged the US brokers to their knees, it's pretty sad. Even big brokers like IBFX have started to open overseas branches.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Problem with IBFX (who was for many years my favorite) is that they promise and promise and it takes YEARS before it actually happens.

Talking about the International Debit Card.

Beginning this year they promised their London operation would start early March/beginning of April.

They forgot again to mention WHAT year.

Happy with whom I am and I think Malta is no war zone country.

Ready to test the trades tonight, hope I can wake up.

Before we start with results this week, I am going to do something a little different. I have changed my "SessionEndTime" to 3:30 GMT to allow more time for re-entries and changed my fib length to 14 to match the end of the session time. Also, I will still be posting regular results as normal, but I will also be adding some new charts with squalou's Counter Trend option as well. You will be able to tell which chart is which as the Breakout strategy will have a "BO" in the corner and the Counter Trend will have "CT" in the corner. Understand that the Counter Trend strategy is a very basic and has not been fully developed as it only utilizes 1 trade (T1) at this time. The current rules are:

- Buy at box Low

- Sell at box High

- TP set to opposite box edge

- SL set to the BO TP1 level

Here are the results for Monday.

I am already looking into a similar 3 tier strategy for the Counter Trend over the course of this week. Developing this will allow us to simultaneously use 2 separate strategies on the same pair. When the pair fails to take advantage of the Breakout strategy, the Counter Trend strategy will reinforce it from the other direction. I will let you know when I have the details finalized. I do have one question, since this will technically be a separate strategy, do you want it placed in a separate thread or just blended in here?

Well is interesting method. waiting for ea. Is it Possible

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I would opt for keeping it all together in one single thread.

When splitting it up, it would make it more difficult to follow and as you already started putting the 2 styles below each other, is stays understandable.

Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Yes, it is coming, slowly. Squalou is working on getting some fixes taken care of first and to make sure the martingale is working and correct. I'd rather wait to make sure things work smoothly and not to just throw it out and have to keep putting out new versions everyday to fix the bugs in it.

I appreciate the input Freddy, that's what my first inclination was but I want to be fair and get people's opinions and then decide.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
hey mer, what if

on the entry buy : we put 2 orders buy and sell ..

for buy order: TP: as usual SL: half of the box in pips inside box

for the sell order TP: other side of the box SL: half of the box in pips above the box

same for entry sell

Hi Scott, "just blended in here" thanks

BTW: great thread and strategy, looking forward to the EA.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
A sound idea, but I really want to keep a similar style and format to the BO strategy so those who trade the original strategy and those who come in later will be able to pick it up quickly. But as I always say, trade this as you wish as the are no set boundaries if you want to experiment. IMO, having two totally different styles of placing orders can confuse people, and I don't want that to happen. I want people who will eventually add the CT strategy to be able to get their hands dirty right away without having to adjust to learning a different entry format. But don't worry, the CT strategy will have a little twist in it.

Thanks for the input Boome and foxy.

Hello.

Can I add something for testing purpose?

Yesterday we missed good opportunity open position when one big candle went true whole box.

Price had very good speed and it was very unlikely that price will stock at the opposite edge of the box.

What if we start to open position not only when candle closing inside but when price reaching opposite side of the box without closing inside.

Thanks.

You can feel free to test that on your own. I am not going to make exceptions regarding my re-entry criteria, especially 15 pages deep into the thread, sorry. I made those rules for a reason as we have way too many reversals around those points, trust me, I've looked. Yes, you will miss some opportunities, but it will also it will save you from some bad trades as well, that's the way things go in this business. Again, you may trade this strategy anyway you desire, but I just can't change the thread rules for every time someone asks, it will just make things more confusing.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Well said.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yes, this situation when price punch whole box happens very seldom,

so let's keep the rules simple.

If somebody find this adding useful for him fill free to use it.

And another question.

After creating EA we will be able only change some parameters like:

limit max and min size of the box,

start time and finish time forming of the box

may be multiplier distance for T1 T2 and T3

quantity trades per day

may be change martingales sequence, some traders cannot afford this multipliers case relatively small account. Good idea to use the multipliers to recoup the loss and giant some 10% without involving big pips swinging in plus and minus, that will give chance for more people use martingale.

And we could change some another parameters in EA.

But truth is, that any system with some complex of parameters can works only some short period, after which we have to adjust them again to continuing profitable trade.

So why we keeping all rules conserved with the stage of the firs page evolution.

We all trying to improve this very good system.

And by the way I am very proud to meet here some veterans of forex trading.

Special thanks to Mer who is patiently answering all questions and suggestions, and keeping alive this good thread!

PS

This system dos not let to rise the profit.

Some day we can see price moving far away from target T3 that limit our potential profit.

Thank you. And I'm not trying to be mean, I just like my threads to be clean and to not get too twisted around like some that I've seen on this site. Everyone here is an    intelligent adult and very capable of trying things out on your own. But please, if you need help, don't hesitate to ask for it.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
.......and I have a question.

Last night I had red boxes show on charts of EU and GU (I don't check much more)

Still the price made a HUGE move.

How do you evaluate that for yourself:

A. I stuck to the rules and did not setup any trades because of the box signaled red.(what I did)

B. I would have risked a smaller position anyhow?

Just trying to get into the right mindset.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
1. I believe you will be able to adjust almost all those type of parameters to fit your needs.

2. I am not conserving or restricting the rules of this strategy at all. I'm am just keeping control of my thread with a firm grasp, which is just my choice. I just don't want 100 different variations posted in the same thread. Take the basics and use them as you wish. If you have new ideas and want to bounce them off the other traders, great, we're here for that.

3. I agree that the market changes over time and that all strategies must be tweaked and adjusted to match the  markets current state. Frankly, and I'm not singling you out netant, but I'm not here to hand people everything on a silver platter. Everyone must learn, use, and adapt these strategies on their own to be able to grow as a trader. I'm always here to help as much as I can, but I'm not here to hold anyone's hand.

4. I am going to give you and any trader who reads this post some good advice, greed is the number one reason traders lose money. I see so many people on here wanting to double or triple their account each month and sooner or later it comes around and bites them in the a##. If I make 25 pips and then price moves 500 pips away from my T3, I don't care. There is always another day and I know I can put 25 pips worth of profit in the bank. And by the way, there is some talk of adding a trailing stop to the T3 part of the trade since we are already locking in pips at the T2 point.

If you're talking about the minimum box size where it says "Caution!", You can trade those , just make sure you are going to make money on the trade. If you have a 15 pip box and the T1 is only 7 or 8 pips, it's really not a profitable deal unless you're reaching a T2 or beyond because the spread will always be against you in those situations. And if you're talking about trading using the red max boxes that sat "No Trade", my philosophy is that the farther you stretch your targets, you are allowing more risk as you will have a harder time reaching those targets. Yes, you will lose out on those big breakouts, but again, there is always another day to trade. Not placing any trades is an exceptional display of discipline which is something every trader needs to develop. And yes, you are always safer to reduce your lot size in those instances, that's what I do when there are marginal situations like that.

Nectant, well that was FOMC News, so there was no way you could have got into that without avoiding serious slippage if you are trading live. Just follow the rules and you will be okay. As the saying goes half bread is better than none

--- 帖子 #228 ---
okeheidon, you were correct, it was the FOMC news that made the spike, but I do have to defend netant as he still has the right to trade that type of setup. You definitely would have to deal with the slippage and the spread widening that most likely came with it. That's why I don't trade NFP days as well, mainly because of the slippage.

A suggestion for trading days when the initial range is very small.  If you look at USJP for July you will see about 10 days when the red flag was flying.  So my idea is this using the data from 27th July.

Enter the trade at TP1 - 87.14.  SL will be 86.82, the short TP1 giving a range of 32 p.  So TP3 becomes 64 p at 82.78.  To get TP1 and 2 I just divided by 3 so TP1 is 21 p, 87.35, and TP2 is 42 p at 87.56.  And that is it.  I know that just one month is a very small example but is worked very well for that one month.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Mer,

Recommendation for trailing stop instead of traditional is doing a % of total.

If move is 100 pips positive, set at X% trail of move.  This is in my opinion much more effective!  I am a big fib trader, so if it retraces greater than 61%, I am out, so I would put my x% at less than 40%, but 20% from testing works very very well as the 76% fib is a great bouncer as well.

There is a BEN Trailing Stop in the Platform Tech area that is quite good.    I am sure SQ would have no problem putting in such flexibility!

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I'm sorry, I'm a little confused by your explanation, can you please post a pic so we can visual see what you are trying to accomplish.

Your in my head, get out!!!  Just kidding, I am a big believer in fibs too and that makes great sense. The thing we are looking into is do we add a 4th trade that is trailed after the T3 closes or do we sacrifice a TP level to let our T3 run? It's a tough choice and we would have to look at all the options first.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I have never attached a chart before so I have no idea if this will work.  If it does you will see the red horizontal lines showing the entry point and the TP's.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
First of all I am NOT a programmer, so cannot really change it myself, but I would like to have the 4th TP option in there.

Maybe it is too easily said, that adding it would not be much work.

Why sacrifice a level if it can be protected and saved?!

Just my 2 pesos

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I see what your saying now. Another good idea for those who want to trade those smaller caution boxes. Understand though that I believe the EA will not trade a "Caution!" box, you would need to do that manually. I personally do not trade Usd/Jpy because of the smaller range during those times (as you pointed out with all the red "Caution!" boxes). Usd/Jpy is best traded during the Asian session.

Well, I totally agree with you Freddy. I would rather add a 4th trade to the mix, but then you run into those traders who are limited in the proper funding to protect your equity and allow the necessary drawdowns in those situations where the multipliers can run up on you.

But let's say we just move the stop when we hit the T3 and trail it. When you hit the T3 and lock in those pips at T2, you risk losing those pips you made from T2 to T3 on a reversal. But the key here is what is the possible reward here? your T3 could run 200 pips farther! It could only go another 20 pips past and reverse, we have no clue. And how much do you trail the T3 by? 10 pips? 20? 50? who knows? I think there is validity to make the change but it would definitely need some extensive testing to validate if it is worthwhile to pursue.

For some secret reason my 3 order script stopped working and so I placed ONLY long EU orders by hand last night.

Decided to go to bed when I saw the price climbing.....................to be greeted in the morning with a losing trade EU.

Luckily testing on a demo, while I made pips on my normally used strategy in my live account.

Still very in love with this LBO stuff, as it will leave me time to do other things when all is running as is in the pipeline.

open your own thread and discuss your strategy.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Yes, and then to remember it worked for a little while!

Now my reasoning for not really trying to solve it at the moment is that in due course the so awaited EA is expected to be posted here and I expect it to be incorporated in it already,

Correct me if I am wrong, in case I am, then I have work to do.

FXDD Malta is changing live accts over the weekend, so I am a bit cornered at the moment.

Gilbert,

Please open another thread, I would be interested in seeing more!  I love RENKO!

I don't think he was meaning to be 'mean', just quick and to the point.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Added some explanation on the chart.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
One thing is for sure that with RENKO bricks the PA looks a lot calmer.

Indeed you will notice earlier entries into a move.

I have both options on my screens and testing which I like best.

I think also that it would be better for Gilbert to start his own thread.

That way both ways can develop on their own and many followers will switch between both to find out and decide for themselves which way serves them the best.

So to Gilbert:

aanpakken jongen, open that thread and let us know.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I have to agree, I don't think he was being rude, they were just trying to respect my rules of the thread. Remember, I posted this right there in bold letters in post #1.

"*Before we start, as courtesy, please refrain from comments about the  nature of martingale strategies. We all know by now any inherent risks  involved with using them and do not need to be reminded over and over.  If you are one of those who hate martingale strategies, please just move  on and not disrupt the thread, this will obviously not be for you.  Also, please do not flood the thread with "you should do this or add  this" or "this would work better" comments. I want prefer to  stick to the original strategy posted, but if you want to play around  with the settings and add other indicators, please feel free to do so on  your own, otherwise it confuses those who want to follow the original  premise of the strategy, thank you.*"

As I mentioned in earlier posts, I have been looking into a 3 tiered version of the CT part of the strategy as well. I would like to go another week with just using the basic single trade version we're using now to make sure it wasn't a fluke and then we will go from there.

Hello mer,

I've been reading your thread since the start and find it very interesting. I also find a lot of what you are doing goes against my knowledge of trading. Now don't take that wrong as we all have our own ideas. The thing I like about your system is it's very visual and not overloaded with indicators. The thing I don't like is the lack of any indicator. As far as using a martingale system that's up to the trader and I won't comment on that part.

Would you mind me taking this system on another thread for discussion? I'm not looking to take over your ideas but just discuss other options and of course your ideas and discussion would be welcome as well. Please let me know.

Johnny

Hey, I have no issues with anyone discussing any of my strategies and I appreciate you having the courtesy to ask.

I used to be one of those guys that had to have a million indicators on my charts until I realized that 95% of them are lagging in relation to price. I have since dropped using indicators for the most part except for one or two leading indicators like RSI or Stochastic.

What I like about breakout strategies is that they're success is based upon price action and the indicator's levels are based on Fibonacci levels and extensions. If anyone wants to learn more of the basics on price action, read the James 16 chart thread or if you want to learn more on Fibs, read Bobokus' thread of Fibonacci trading.

Dear traders,

Please do not misunderstand me, I find this thread very well.

I am going to use it the coming week my self on both M15 and Renko 7 pips boxsize.

The only thing I want to show with Renko charts is that this gives a quieter picture of a price movement compared to time frames where every x-minutes a candle is formed, even if the price moves are not significant.

I attached two charts for you to clarify this.

I have no desire to start an own thread on that and believe that it is not necessary. I wanted nothing but to give my contribution on this beautiful thread.

Kind regards, Gilbert.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I know you have good intentions here and there are some very positive points to be made using Renko, but this is not the place to do it. What your showing is a vastly different concept and  really should be placed in it's own thread and I would appreciate it if  you would.If there are those who are  interested in the way you trade this with Renko, and I'm sure there are,  I'm sure they will follow you. The only changes I'm interested in are changes to the indicator in post #1 that could be improved upon, like sqaulou's idea of reworking the indicator and using it with the counter trend.  Now if you still have no desire to open a thread, then please just follow along and trade the way you want on your own as I'm not interested in adding a Renko indicator to this strategy, sorry.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Gilbert,

Using RENKO or not, doesn't really matter in my opinion.  It isn't really showing the true price anyways, due to 'no tails' showing.  I suggest you change your renko to showing tails and I think you get a clearer picture of true price action.  I agree that RENKO is cleaner.    But, it could also confuse people who are not as advanced as you are and I believe that MER is trying to make this simple as it is more fun that way from all the indicator crazy threads.

Hi guys,

the so awaited EA is finally available now, here !

Attached is the EA that you should put in your (mt4)/experts folder.

And its User's Guide in text format, that i reproduce here.

Now you can start backtesting, tuning, squeezing, tweeking, whatever-ing...

Please run some SERIOUS backtests before starting using the Martingale option.

You will soon discover that it is very nice during 99% of the time, giving a very smooth-looking and PROFITABLE outcome, but... that 1% remaining time, it will just KILL YOUR ACCOUNT...

Enjoy...

//| 3 Tier London Breakout.mq4 EA, by Squalou

//|                  User's Guide

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+

This EA trades the "3 Tier London Breakout" strategy posted by mer071898 on forexfactory.com

thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=247220

=======================================================================

* Visual help with or without the "3 Tier London Breakout.mq4" indicator:

=======================================================================

This EA can be used along with the "3 Tier London Breakout.mq4" indicator for visual help.

The Indicator will draw the breakout box and TP levels for a given number of days in the past.

The EA can also be configured to draw the breakout box and TP levels by itself, but it will do it only for "today",

and will draw new boxes&levels formed at the beginning of each new session.

However, it will not draw box/levels for the days prior to the time you started the EA.

=======================================================================

!!! SERIOUS WARNING !!!

=======================================================================

As a security, when running this EA without changing any inputs, this EA is LOCKED and will NOT send any trades.

This is to prevent silly "blindly-load-and-run-and-get-burned" kind of negligent behaviour...

First, you MUST understand how the strategy works, as it is explained in the thread;

Second, you need to read this User's Guide to understand how to setup the EA inputs, and how to unlock it to allow it to trade.

Then it is recommended to use the EA on a Demo account for backtesting and forwardtesting,

in order to get familiar with the use of the EA and its inputs;
Only after these steps, you can start using it on your live account, AT YOUR OWN RISK.

=======================================================================

* EA Input parameters:

=======================================================================

extern bool       SendTrades = false;
You must set this to true if you want the EA to place trades;

By default, the EA will NOT send trades, but only show indicator's boxes and fibs (if "ShowBoxes" is true)

extern double     Lot  = 0.01;
number Lots to use for each open trade;

extern double     MaxRisk = 0;
Risk management:

MaxRisk is used only when not using the Martingale options;

It is the percentage of the account free margin that will be used to compute the size of the open orders

depending on the stoploss level;

if MaxRisk is 0, then the size of open orders will be "Lot";

extern int        MagicNumber=0;
the MagicNumber value to be used when opening orders;

The EA will open 3 trades at a time, each trade will have a different MagicNumber, as follows:

magic number for trade #1 = MagicNumber;

magic number for trade #2 = MagicNumber+1;

magic number for trade #3 = MagicNumber+2;

MagicNumbers are used by the EA to handle its trades,

so it is important to set this value so that they will not interfere with other EA's trades.

In particular, you must use DIFFERENT MagicNumber ranges when rnuning this same EA on DIFFERENT PAIRS;

When "MagicNumber" is 0, the EA will create a unique MagicNumber range for the current chart/pair;

Running multiple EA on different pairs, all with MagicNumber" set to 0 ensures that all trades will have different MagicNumbers.

extern string     StartTime    = "06:00";
time for start of breakout box;

extern string     EndTime      = "09:14";
time for end of breakout box;

Setting the minutes to ":14" ensures that the "last" 15-minutes bar is being included in the box when rnuning the EA

on a timeframe lower than M15, which is the timeframe suggested by the startegy.

By setting the minutes to ":14", you can run the EA on M1 or M5 charts, and still get the same box and levels as if you were

running it on the M15 chart.

extern string     SessionEndTime= "01:00";
End of daily session: no new trades will be open after this time;

However, the EA will continue to take care of trades that were opened before this time, and which are still open;

They will remain open until they either reach their TP or SL.

The EA will continue handling the jumping stop on these trades until they close.

extern int        MinBoxSizeInPips = 25;
minimum tradable box size in pips (not Points);

when the box is smaller than that value, the EA will NOT send trades during this session;

extern int        MaxBoxSizeInPips = 50;
maximum tradable box size in pips;

The EA will either not trade when the box is larger than that value,

or limit the box size to that value, depending on the "LimitBoxToMaxSize" input below;

extern bool       LimitBoxToMaxSize = true;
when true, a box larger than MaxBoxSizeInPips will be limited to MaxBoxSizeInPips,

and centered on the EMA of the price during the box time range.

extern double     TP1Factor    = 0.618;
the factor applied to the box size to determine the TP target for Trade #1 (TP1).

TP1 is the box edge +/- TP1Factor * box_size;

Example: if the bow size is 32pips, then:

TP1 for Buy  is box High + TP1Factor * 32pips;

TP1 for Sell is box Low  - TP1Factor * 32pips;

Extension to the strategy:

--------------------------
TP1Factor can be set to be a FIXED PIP value rather than a factor of the box size;

When TP1Factor is >=10, it is considered as a FIXED PIPs value to be applied to the box edges;

Example: with TP1Factor set to 30:

TP1 for Buy  is box High + 30pips;

TP1 for Sell is box Low  - 30pips;

whatever the box size would be;

extern double     TP3Factor    = 2.000;
this is the TP factor for Trade #3 (TP3);

The same principles apply as for the TP1Factor input;

Note: trades are sent by bundles of 3 trades, each having a different TP:

Trade#1 has TP1 target,

Trade#2 has TP2 target,

Trade#3 has TP3 target;

There is NO TP2Factor input;

TP2 is automatically set to be at half-way between TP1 and TP3;

extern double     SLFactor     = 1.000;
this is the StopLoss factor for all trades;

The same principles apply as for the TP1Factor input, except that it is a stoploss value;

extern double     LevelsResizeFactor = 1.0;
this factor is applied to all TP/SL factors;

this can be used to widen or narrow all TP and SL values by the same factor;

extern string     TradeComment="3 Tier London Breakout";

extern int        MaxTradesAllowedPerSession=0;
Maximum number of 3-trades-series that can be open per session (re-entries);

A value of 1 means there will be only 3 trades open during this session (1 series of 3 Trades);

When MaxTradesAllowedPerSession is 0, there is no limit on the number of trades open per session;

extern int        MaxLossesAllowedPerSession=0;
Maximum number of lost 3-trades-series per session;

A value of 1 means the EA will not open new trades after 3 lost trades on this session;

By the nature of the strategy, all 3 trades of series will end either all in profit, or all in loss;

When MaxTradesAllowedPerSession is 0, there is no limit on the number of losses per session;

extern int        BreakEvenProfitInPips=1;
number of pips to lock-in when moving the SL to BE;

Trades #2 & #3 are moved to BE+BreakEvenProfitInPips when TP1 is reached

(Trade #1 should have reached its TP, unless the spread is high);

extern string     martingale_sequence="0,1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181";
MARTINGALE multipliers sequence;

when the first multiplier of the sequence is 0, the Martingale is DISABLED;

In order to enable the Martingale sequence, you should remove the trailing "0,";

After a lost series, the size of the next open trades will be determined by the next Martingale multiplier,

in order to try to recoup the losses;

The Lot multiplier will continue to increase until the losses are COMPLETELY recouped;

When the highest multiplier is reached, it is used for all new trades until the losses are COMPLETELY recouped;

extern bool       AutoMartingale=false;
Auto-martingaling mode:

When true, the Lot multiplier will be calculated so that the losses are recouped, and will add the current TP,

instead of picking the multiplier in the sequence;

This should make the Lot multiplier increase more smoothly, but there is NO LIMIT to the multiplier value,

which may become VERY HIGH and produce VERY HIGH RISK in the case of a high number of concecutive losses.

extern bool       ResetMartAtFirstProfit=false; // when true, the Mart sequence is reset as soon as profitable trade is reached; else it will scale-in until recouped ALL losses;

The strategy requires to continue martingaling until ALL losses are recouped;

even when a series of trades end-up in profit, the pips recouped by this winning series may not recoup all past losses,

even in AutoMartingale mode;

This is because the 3 trades are open with the same SL, but different TP values.

If only TP1 is reached, and TP1Factor is less than SLFactor, then the won pips will not cover a past lost series,

and we should continue to martingale the next trades;

When ResetMartAtFirstProfit is true, martingaling will stop at the first profitable series, and the multiplier

will be reset to 1.

This limits the increase of the martingale multiplier, therefore limiting the risk,

but at the cost of possibly not recouping all lost pips.

extern int        Slippage = 3;
slippage value in pips for each open trade;

extern bool       brokerIsECN=false;
set this to true when your broker is an ECN, which do not accept to send orders with a SL;

Orders are open in 2 esparate actions to set to the SL;

**** Settings for autonomously drawing the box and levels, similar to the Indicator's inputs:

extern bool       ShowBoxes    = true;
set this to true to make the EA draw the boxes and levels just like the Indicator would do;

this avoids using the indicator AND the EA together;

Colors for box and levels zones:

extern color      BoxColorOK   = LightBlue;
color of the box when its size is "ok to trade"

extern color      BoxColorNOK  = Red;
color of the box when its size is "NOT ok to trade"

extern color      BoxColorMAX  = Orange;
color of the box when its size is greater than MaxBoxSizeInPips and LimitBoxToMaxSize is true;

extern color      LevelColor   = Black;

extern color      SessionColor = Linen; // show Session periods with a different background color
extern int        FibLength    = 12;

extern bool       showProfitZone = true;  // show profit zone in green
extern color      ProfitColor  = LightGreen; // profit zone color

extern string     objPrefix = "LB2-";  // Prefixes of London Breakout Indicator objects;

extern string     Gap="          ";

Other martingale sequences, in decreasing aggressivity(risk) order:
these "inputs" are not uesd in the EA, but only for informational purpose:

You can can easily copy/paste those martingale sequences to replace the default sequence in set in "martingale_sequence":

extern string     aggressive_fibonacci_sequence="1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181"; // =every second term of fibonacci sequence;

extern string     powers_of_2_sequence="1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096";

extern string     fibonacci_sequence="1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597"; // F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2);

extern string     mild_fibonacci_sequence="1,2,3,4,6,9,13,19,28,41,60,88,129,189,277,406"; // F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-3);

Maybe we Dutch are not the smartest

Anyway, I understand the whole thread to eventually get to a functioning trading style using an EA.

In that vision, there is no need to improve indicators, as what more is there to improve above what is already doing a fine job?!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
CONGRATS, Squalou !!!!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Thank you Squalou for your work !!!! You rock !!! I hope some day I will have chance to shake your handhttp://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

I have one quaestion. What about CT option? Will ther be another EA ? Or shall we adjust somehow current one?

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thank you very, very much Squalou for giving us this EA! And thanks again mer071898 for developing the strategy.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Just another warning, don't be silly and try running this on a $1k or $2K demo backtest and expect this to work. The lowest I've been able to safely backtest this for a whole year was on Gbp/Usd in 09 with $20K and using a standard and aggressive (default) Fibonacci sequence using .01 lots. Remember, this strategy needs capital TO WORK PROPERLY.

A 3 tier CT strategy is in the works and hopefully sqaulou can make simple changes to the indicator and the EA for that as well. I would encourage those who have appreciated sqaulou's efforts to contact him privately and maybe send a "contribution" his way, I'm sure he would appreciate it as it has definitely been earned.

Scott & squalou

Thank you so much for both of your incredible effort of giving selflessly.

I really wish that i can vouch for you ... ...

Anyway, thank you.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Excellent work guys on both the strategy and the EA. Looking forward to testing !

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Squalou thanks for your outstanding work and generous donation.

could you clarify the box times please - do we have to adjust for GMT shift. eg. add +1 for servers which are GMT+1 like Alpari UK?

The onscreen text quotes both local and server time - which does the EA use?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
The strategies box is based off of GMT+0 or 05:00 to 08:00 GMT. The default box time in the EA is 06:00 to 09:14 which is GMT+1. If your on GMT +1, just keep everything the same. I changed my session end time to 02:00 to allow a little extra trading time, but that is just my preference.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
thanks for the clarification.

The error code is invalid stops.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
First off, thanks Squalou for a great piece of work. Just running the ea on strategy tester - haven't had any problems in opening trades!

However, just a couple of q's.

1. Are there no settings for box offset in the EA?

2. Is it possible to have a condition where instead of 3 trades being opened, just one trade is opened, obviously with the single tp1. just testing to see whether in terms of dd in the event of a losing trade, it plays better than 3 trades, bearing in mind that you will have just the one trade hitting s/l instead of 3, and then the martingale should bring you back to profit anyway. I think it may be a useful option.

Thanks once again.

Pardy

--- 帖子 #289 ---
1. no offset yet in the EA

2. you can set TP3 = TP1, this will make the EA open 3 trades all with TP1 target. So, you still have 3 trades instead of just 1, but they will all hit the same TP1 at the same time  ;

Just divide by 3 the usual Lot value that you are using (if possible), or divide by 3 the final profit/loss result...

sq

--- 帖子 #290 ---
stops are far enough from the open price, so it must that you need to set the "brokerisECN" to true to send orders in 2-steps to place the SL.

SQ

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I Have an error:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #292 ---
error 131 is "invalid trade volume".

Non-mini/micro accounts won't allow Lot sizes under 0.1 (0.01 will be rejected).

Read this:
http://forum.mql4.com/27472

You are probably in this case.

Try changing the Lot value to fit the LOTSTEP value, probably by steps of 0.1 lot.

When using Martingale, this might actually be an issue in the EA, as it does not round the Lot size based on the LOTSTEP value...

I will fix that.

SQ

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi Squalou,

Thanks for that - I've sorted it by simply commenting out ordersend 2 and 3!

Quite a versatile EA, I like the max losses per pair. I have mine set to max 3 losing trades, to avoid days when price is just ranging, and thus keep martingale restricted. I've noticed tho' that these are not "consecutive" losses, but a total of 3 losing trades in the trading session. Should it be "consecutive"?

Pardy

Regards

Pardy

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi SQ,

I have changed the Lot-size to 0.1, to 1.0 but still have same problem.

Martingale is disabled.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
If you are setting the MaxRisk to non-0 (perhaps 2 (percent)), that could generate lot sizes smaller than the minimum lotsize of your account, depending on how much is on account.

Here is a small script i had written for myself to show market information.

That can be useful sometimes.

To get more diagnostic from the EA, replace this line:

Inserted Code   _Alert("OrderSend() FAILED at "+DoubleToStr(price,Digits)+",SL="+DoubleToStr(stoploss,Digits)+",TP="+DoubleToStr(takeprofit,Digits)+",Ask="+DoubleToStr(Ask,Digits)+" ("+err+"): "+ErrorDescription(err));

by this line:

Inserted Code   _Alert("OrderSend() FAILED: "+DoubleToStr(lots,2)+" lots at "+DoubleToStr(price,Digits)+",SL="+DoubleToStr(stoploss,Digits)+",TP="+DoubleToStr(takeprofit,Digits)+",Ask="+DoubleToStr(Ask,Digits)+" ("+err+"): "+ErrorDescription(err));

And see what the journal says now.

It will print the lotsize of each failed trade.

SQ

--- 帖子 #296 ---
It is a max limit per session overall, not consecutive losses.

If market is in a tight range, then the losses will likely be consecutive, but not necessarily.

When using martingale, the lost pips will be recouped even with non-consecutice losses (if you have enough capital to scale-in...)

Sq

--- 帖子 #297 ---
You're right, of course. Mostly they will be consecutive anyway. Not an issue, and I like the way the martingale recoups the losses. With just taking one trade, capital requirements will of course be lower....

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hello Squalou,

Please have a look at attached screenshot from today testing on demo accont. Do not pay too much attention at box size. I am testing different sizes.

My question is why the EA did not move SL to BE+1 pips for second batch of 3 sell orders - when TP 1 was hit? The trade closed at SL with loss. Is there a logic problem? Or is it connected with closed bar - inside or outside some levels?

What do you think?

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Here is what it shows:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When I test with Modell 2 then it's all ok. Modell 1 is not ok.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
When TP1 is hit, trades 2&3 should be moved to BE+1, which is not being the case here.

Sometimes the spread will make tarde 1 hit TP1, although price has not actually reached TP1, and therefore trades 2&3 will NOT be moved to BE.

The journal will tell you what did/did not happen.

When SL are moved, there is an Alert popping, and that also shows in the journal, typically like this:

What do you have in your journal ?

Note: you can select the lines in the journal window (wlick on first line, then shift-arrow up or down to extend the selection, then ctrl-C),

and paste them directly in the post (that's what i just did above), no need to put that as an image or a doc file.

SQ

--- 帖子 #301 ---
more and more strange.... !

i can't see why "every tick" model would generate error 131 and "control points" mode would not !

1.00 lot is ok in any type of account, and the marketinfo script clearly shows 0.01 lots are allowed.

?!?!???

If anyone has a clue about that, we would be happy to here about it...

Backtesting on control points only on M15 will give unreliable results.

You shoud at least go down to M1 in the backtest -- you can do that with the EA, it can be run on M1,M5 or M15 charts.

SQ

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Tested again with M1...it works. M15 not!

Is there a difference between M1 and M15 when backtasting this EA?

I have tried to backtest with the same settings like mer did from post #276

I have Modelling quality of 99% but the results are different.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Dude, you rock!    You are a great programmer!

One question and I hope I didn't miss someone else asking it, but I don't see the "ResetMartAtFirstProfit=false;" option in the choices?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Mer,

Just to double check here...

If my broker is GMT - 0, then my times in the EA need to read:

05:00 start

08:15 end

01:00 session end time

Is that right?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Yes, you are correct, I'm sure sqaulou will chime in since he wrote the book, so to speak.

Yes, except you want to put the end time at 08:14 instead as you want to include everything up to the 08:15 candle but not actually include the 08:15 candle, I hope that didn't confuse you. You may want to check post #19 as this is how I make sure the indicator times are correct as some brokers do not follow British Summer Time.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
hehe... too much steam up there makes things foggy sometimes

i posted an earlier version, not the latest one, oops...

It isn't far from the "correct" version, just a couple of inputs slightly changed names, and that "missing" ResetMartAtFirstProfit one...

No behaviour modification, so it will trade exactly the same way.

Here is the "true" version -- ok, now that'll be v1.1...

Sq

--- 帖子 #307 ---
there shouldn't be any difference in using M1,M5 or M15, as long as you use the "every tick" model.

I figured that a possible reason why it doesn't work on M15 but does on M1 could be that your M15 history is incomplete perhaps.

Not sure though...

Try rebuilding the M15 history using the History window (F2).

Or use the "Refresh" action on an M15 chart, that will update the M15 bars as well.

That's all i have in mind right now...

SQ

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Actually, I can confirm that for some reason the ea gives different results on m1 as opposed to m15.  I am using duka tick data for backtesting and spent some time optimizing eurusd m15.  Took those optimized settings and ran same setup on m1 and results were massively different, no idea why.

It's quite interesting.

Anyhow, nice job on this ea squalou, fun to play with

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yes, sorry, I was lazy and put 8:15...    I got it.

Aloha!

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Mer, very nice strategy, but i have a little confuse with GMT setting...can you show your MT4 picture when the EA start, so i can setting time according to what you use, thanks...

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Mer; although I was not a fan of the first version of the LondonBreakOut, I kept on following because I felt you would come with something that is more like my trading style (in terms of risk) .... and I have to admit that this new LBO is wonderful and profitable

Squalou; excellent work for the EA, you beat me at it (it was, indeed, more complicated than I first thought)

For everyone to investigate, here are two of my backtest on the dukascopy TICK datasets, for 2008.01 to 2009.07 (it's a 2Gb file, thus the limit of MT4 .. that's the only reason why i didn't do it up to 2010.07 ... but will do).

2 backtests, one that I would qualify as an agressive one, and another that I would qualify as Conservative.

My PERSONAL test is ... does this system is overall profitable with a 2500$ deposit. It's personal, no explanation, but for me if a system is not profitable with such deposit, then it's not profitable .. that's it.

RESULTS: Mer LBO is definitly profitable, and you may suffer only limited DD (18% for quiet approach).

Conservative

Aggressive
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

From There:

1. play with Sq's code so as to increase initial lot size upon reaching certain balance ... whether %balance or else ....

2. Eventually correlate MAx/Min box size with DD ? I think it may be statistically significant.

3. Might be worse having even another lot strategy .. that would guarantee a define "equity slope" .... it might be more than Sq's auto-martingale but less than Mer's

4. Define MAx/Min box size on prior day volatility/volume and high/Low ?

That's my thinking so far. I hope this might contribute.

.... few more backtest and I go live. I will let you know.

PS: I'm impressed by both Squalou and Mer.

Do you guys have the report showing your trades that were taken as well, not just the summary.

By the way, I will not get results from Monday up until Tuesday morning as I just got back in town from a seminar about an hour ago and I'm exhausted and need to get some sleep. Plus, I have a surprise for everyone.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
mer,may we know what is the surprise you mean?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hey,

1.) wanted to ask you where you have the instruction from to create those tickdata. I've found one and followed the instructions. I have 99% modelling quality too but I cant backtest in an M15 mode. M1 is doing well.

2.) do you use the fxt.multiloader to disabling the MT4 default behavior to regenerate the backtest files? If yes can you save the full report after the backtest? When I use the multilooader it shows me the dialog where I can save the report....i klick on it but nothing happen. I hope you can help me.

EDIT: Found my Problem. I have deleted my files in the templates-folder: statement.htm and statementdetailed.htm. After reinstalling its ok now.

I'm glad we can bring you over to the dark side. I am really amazed you were able to test this with such a small amount. I'd love to see the trades it took.

Well, it wouldn't be a surprise then now would it? It's nothing major, just a few changes. I'm sure everyone will be happy to see it.

Thanks for reply. I got your point. Is it possible to change logic of is EA to be 100 % sure that trades 2&3 are moved to BE+1 always when TP1 is hit?

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #320 ---
i'll work this out, indeed, this is not satisfactory, it gives an unreliable behaviour and we definitely don't want this to happen, especially with the martingale enabled...

SQ

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I agree, it would be silly to have the two remaining trades stopped out when they should be profitable trades. In backtesting, we obviously don't run into this, but in a live environment with spread widening and news events it could be devastating. The perfect solution is to move T2 & T3 to BE+1 if A) price hits Target 1 or B) if T1 is closed before reaching Target 1.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
hi tazmaan,

the report you posted shows a martingale_sequence being set to the what i called the "fibonacci_sequence", however the lot sizes in the report are definitely the "powers_of_2_sequence"... ?!?

This is confusing...

Have you changed the EA code itself to replace the sequence ?

You could simply copy/paste the contents of the "powers_of_2_sequence" string into the "martingale_sequence" input, and that will do it... no need to change the code itself.

This is why i added those extra sequence strings in the end, just as an easy-to-find reference.

SQ

--- 帖子 #323 ---
absolutely!

that's what i'll do.

Ok,

just to compare the report of mer071898 from post #276 I have made one with the same settings. I set the tickdata with 3pips spread. Here is what I got:

Hello WatchERKB

I use Birt's EA website instructions on how to DL and convert the Dukascopy data.

I do use the multiLoaded.

I set a fixed spread at 4.

I play a little with the Leverage. Sometimes I set it to 100:1, and also to 200:1 and 500:1 so as to refine my "live" strategy. (respectively FXCM, Alpari or GoMarkets) .... yes the Leverage for one's account is written in the fxt files ;-)

Hey SQ,

My test EA didn't work last night for some reason.  Using IBFX, mini-account (nano) with .01 lots on GMT even.

I have attached my .set file and all I got was 'box' to big warnings with 'old tick data' messages in the journal.

I have the limitboxsize variable to false in the EA?

Thanks..

Looking forward to following this thread and EA. Been trading manually similar strategy for a bit now. Would love to automate my night shift and get a full night's sleep for a change.

Awesome work! I could see a few tweaks to prevent false breakout scenarios. But will wait and see what you are already working on.

Okay, before I try to catch up on the results from Monday, I will let everyone in on the little surprise. Like I said, it's not a big deal but most of you I'm sure will be using it.

I have added two (2) more target levels to the LBO indicator and have posted it below along with a new template and also replaced it in Post#1. For those traders out there that like to let your trades run, this is for you. You can see the Target 4 & 5 on the charts in the pic.

You will only see the input for TPFactor5 in the indicator's parameters because TPfactor 4 is calculated the same as TPFactor2, by adding Target 3 & 5 together and dividing them by 2. Target 5 is set to the 3.618 Fib extension by default. Feel free to change it to whatever you are comfortable using. I have also e-mailed sqaulou and we are looking to add this to the EA, but we are deciding on the proper way to best take advantage of the new Targets.

***Update***

Sqaulou has made a few adjustment to the indicator where it will now draw the zones over the weekend from Friday and added a few comments to the parameters. I have updated it here and in post #1.

Nice job Guys.

I'm still waiting to see how this system plays out. Solving the false breakouts seems to be the biggest issue but this can be quite fixable. I opt for a risk/profit 30 pip pyramid method to get similar results instead of the martingale. Moving the stop loss to the mid-point might work with a bigger box or a fixed pip amount would be nice. Concentrating on these issues I predict will quadruple the results of the back test.

Thanks,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Good evening or morning all!

Quick question, is there anything in the settings that would allow entry points 1-5 pips outside the box?

I trade the breakout box manually and have had much better false breakout avoidance if I set my orders just outside the box by 3-5 pips depending on pair. I set the same for my initial SL, just outside the box on the opposite side. That way the price actually has to leave the box range before getting into a position.

It doesn't catch them all. But is sure helps.

Thanks and great work. Love the EA!

ScottyB

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Is it only me that sees the price reversing at the London open a normal thingie. If not then why not change this to some other method of determining direction of the break out. No offense but breaking through the Frankfort high or low just ain't working very well.

1. Maybe code the thing like this, If the last mini trend within the box is up then sell short at the pivot. Whether the price is within the top and bottom of the box or outside the box isn't relevant.

2. Another thing that I see is a price almost reaching a take profit level and then reversing to a loss. Once the price reaches a certain number of pips within range of a take profit level it should be in a no return zone and any price retrace back across this zone is captured as profit.

3. Another set-up is not selling at a set profit level. Once a price has reached a fib level the price is left to go to the next level and the next. Profit is taken only on a retrace out of the zone. This is like a trailing stop but is activated only after a profit level is reached.

Just some ideas here.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Unfortunately, there are no settings for that because the strategy doesn't dictate it. But no one is stopping you from trading that way manually.

Not working well, really???? +13,613 pips on the Breakout strategy were possible last week, and then add another +5893 pips using the new Counter Trend strategy (and that hasn't been fully developed yet!). Yep, your right, it's really not working well at all.

Look, no strategy is perfect and this one is no different. I've said it way too many times on this thread already.

If you don't like the strategy, change it up however you wish to make it work for you and good luck!

I just added additional levels to the London Breakout indicator so you can trade to additional levels. A Counter Trend strategy is in development as we speak. sqaulou is working on a trailing function for the EA. So yes, we are trying to improve everything as we go, but I am only making small changes and not looking to revamp a whole strategy for just 2 or 3 people.

The strategy does require that the price is within the box, hence that's why they call it a Breakout Strategy.

Use the LevelResizeFactor function, this can be used to widen or narrow all TP and SL values by the same factor to shorten the levels if this is happening too much for your taste. This is also why the Counter trend strategy is under development.

Again, we're back to the old  "if you don't like change it" routine again. If you want to take profit on your trades a different way, by all means do so.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Mer,

Thanks for the info I didn't mean to increase your blood pressure. A great system is measured by the percent of draw downs to profit, not just profit. I spent six months, 7 days a week, 12-16 hours a day writing and rewriting code for EA's. I know what makes a system tick. Starting from a blank screen in less then a week I can write a code that produces 15-20 profit factor. Couple that with a your Martingale system or my Risk/Profit system and it explodes exponentially from there. How's a 43 to 1 win/loss ratio raise your blood pressure? I know it did mine.

Pease be with you and good luck I won't bother you anymore with ideas,

Cheers,

Johnny

Don't worry about me, I've learned to develop a thick skin on this site. There are very few people here that can raise my blood pressure. It seems to me that you're coming across as the one who's blood pressure is raised. Just because we don't instantly make changes to suit your needs does not mean you can't take the information here a develop it on your own , which you've apparently done.

If your an experienced coder and you've developed strategies with a 15-20 profit factor and a 43 to 1 win/loss ratio, you'd better dump a couple hundred thousand bucks in the bank. You should be retired in 6 months and not have to bothered with us lowly forum members.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
you publish him at the best here in the forum!!

regards mtbf40

--- 帖子 #362 ---
there is actually of way of doing this...

it is not called "buffer" in the inputs (that's what you want: a "buffer" of 3-5 pips), but you can achieve that with the "LevelsResizeFactor".

It is set to 1.0 by default, but increasing it will expand the box size and levels by this factor.

If you have a box of 40 pips range, and you set LevelsResizeFactor=1.2, this will expand the box by 20% of its size, making it 40*1.2 = 48 pips instead of 40 pips.

And you have your 4 pips buffer here... (4 on top and 4 on bottom = 8 "expanded" pips)

Watch-out that LevelsResizeFactor also expands the target levels as well, so you might want to reduce their values if you want to keep the same levels as for the regular box (divide them by LevelsResizeFactor).

FYI, as this is somewhat in the same topic, you might also have noticed that you can set the target levels as a FIXED pips amount instead of a factor of the box size.

This is achieved by setting the TP1Factor and/or TP3Factor inputs to a number of pips instead of a factor value.

Any value >=10 here will be taken as pips instead of a factor.

LevelsResizeFactor does not apply to fixed pips inputs.

Example: TP1Factor=40 will set the TP1 to 40 pips away from the box edges.

TP1 will remain 40 pips whatever LevelsResizeFactor is.

mer,

I retired a long time ago and my blood pressure is fine. I was just trying to be nice and give some ideas but I understand you being defensive so please calm down I won't do it again. As I said before the system looks great and with a little tweaking you'll do just fine. The next thing you'll be doing is planning your retirement.

Good Luck,

That was remaining from the LBO V1 EA, but could not be kept as per the strategy.

I will use that code for trade #3 at least; perhaps also for trade #2;

Knowing that a trailing/jumping stop can actually make the trade close at a lower price in case of retracement.

With hard TPs, we are locking these pips for sure.

Just a choice.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hello mtbf40,

I don't really understand what you're asking but I finished the EA before being a member of FF or any other Forex site. I was into trading stocks and not currencies at that time. It is not an MT4 program so would be quite useless posting it. I traded off the Daily charts and it was trend line system with stochastic filters. It works on any chart with similar results and was based on a book I read by a professional trader.

Writing it taught me how to trade as I found writing code by a bad trader as I was back then just didn't work. I first had to know how to trade and then write the code. The EA's you see on sites like FF and even the ones for sale on the internet are at best written by good coders and designed by bad traders and hence they only work some of the time and on some charts but in the long run they really are junk. A few months ago a guy was advertising an EA on the internet for $1,400 saying how great the system was and a user would be rich in no time. It showed $143,000 profit in a one week time period for the GBPUSD. This guy posted the back test which showed $675,000 in draw downs. Another site showed 46 continuous losers before the first winner on the back test of their EA. It was obvious that the only money these two could make is scamming people on the internet dumb enough to buy. I'm convinced neither had a clue how to trade.

I'm not in anyway saying that is the case here as very little time has passed since the beginning of this thread and Mer and Squalou are doing a great job and at break neck speed. I'd help them if I could but I do not trade on the MT4 platform and find it lacking in a lot of ways. I also do not trade like this but that doesn't mean their method is flawed and mine is better. The process of building a great EA is a very tedious one and I can only wish them luck.

Johnny

Thank you for that info! I will play with that setting and see what I come up with. I love the strategy as is. But when you have been doing one thing for so long, it's hard to chnge cold turkey. But I think you have me sold on this one. I just need to build my account more to handle a marty across several pairs before I can use the EA as the strategy as described.

Great work and thanks again!

should I send EA issues directly to Squalou or is it better to post them here once for everyone to keep track of the EA development, or would Squalou post a log-file (if I may) of the changes done (if we pm him) each time he upload a new EA version ?

Now, for profitability: I backtested your strategy thanks to Sqalou EA since 2007 on the tick data of Dukascopy, initial deposit of 2500$ and starting lot of 0.01 (see my previous post with complete report) .... I have a complete successful 4-yr backtest that at least double every year.

So for anyone here, the NEW LBO strategy of Mer is incredibly profitable (and risky ... not going there ... but there are multiple ways to manage risk as you are pleased considering all the features Squalou has implemented ... see for yourself ... or blow your account if under capitalized or over-greedy).

Squalou:

1. ECN issue:

I'm using GoMarkets that is an ECN broker. The EA does not work with it although I activated the BorkerECN = true.

I went through the code and realized that you have SL and TP for non-ECN and SL@0 and TP for ECN ... I believe this is the problem as it should be SEND with SL@0 and TP@0 then MODIFY with SL and TP.

I will try this tonight and come back to you.

2. London timeZone:

I think (think, not sure yet I have very little time to spend on Forex these last few weeks), that the EA and indicators should auto-correct for London open considering London is either GMT or GMT+1 depending on the year .... not a biggie to code (will eventually send you something Squalou)

XmPh.

Please post your remarks on the thread, so we can all track what's wrong;

i will be posting the changes history along with each new EA version;

please do

please send your code.

we are running into these questions all the time, so, if there is a reliable way of getting rid of this recurring issue, we'll all be very happy about it, and spent less time (mainly Mer's time...) answering the same questions again and again...

The DST(daylight saving time)  issue is really something we should automate in the EA, as the strategy is very sensitive to it.

We could then run reliable backtests over long periods without having to break them into DST / non-DST periods.

That would be a great improvement indeed.

thanks

SQ.

xmph,

Am I reading this correctly. 74.85% Draw Down. You might consider holding going live for a while until the bugs in this system are worked out. Even the 17.87 DD on the first one with a two year profit of $1,534 isn't very good. The profit vs the risk isn't worth it. Wait and let them sort this out first would be the best advice I'm sure it can only get better.

Hello Squalou,

When you develop indy and EA for CT option that is really usefull for this strategy, will it be connected into one with BO ? or maybe it will be separate indy and EA?

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I would suggest separating Indies and EAs as eventually some ppl feel confortable working on Indies but not on the Eas (that may be more complex). AS well, it is good to backtest only on Indies and look how they evolve without having Eas interferences.

There is fundamentally no drawbacks .... except that of maintaining up to 2 Indies and 1 Eas at a time, if the Ea is not updated yet to the latest version of the Indy.

I'm not Squalou, but that's how I see it.

It may be that the historical data are wrong.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Our wonderful coder extraordinaire, sqaulou, has made an improvement to V.3 of the Breakout indicator. You now have the option to show either 3 targets (as the original indicator) or 5 targets like the new V.3 does. If you only want 3 targets, set the "TPFactor5" input to "0". He has also added a "BO" comment below the box to distinguish it as the BreakOut Strategy. The CT indicator will have the same comment when it's finished.

After seeing the Counter Trend strategy get hammered on the Eur/Usd over the past few days, I'm going to take out the basic CT strategy and bring in the 3 Tiered CT Strategy this evening for visual testing. I will post both indicators here but I will only add the New Breakout indicator to the first post. I don't want to post a version of the CT indicator if it's not done yet, fair enough?

***The CT indicator is a modified version of the Breakout indicator and is  not in it's finished stage, so please keep that in mind and do not worry  about the specific level info and inputs for now. Once we get a final version completed, sqaulou will be taking a look at doing the EA for it***

The new 3 Tier CT strategy will be taking advantage of the retraces from the targets instead of retraces from the box. This will hopefully eliminate the false breakouts that everyone is getting annoyed with and should cut down on the whiplashing around the box which is what gets us in trouble and increases the multiplier's too fast. I will show examples later on regarding how to enter and follow the trades. I am also going to adjust the Breakout Strategy's target levels to a more appealing 1:1 R/R ratio.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Excelent!

Thank you and SQ.

Perhaps it is better to rename the template file corresponding to 3 Tier london breakout V3.1.tpl.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
hi,

help my how to install the EA (3 Tier London Breakout EA.mq4) to 5 targets (v3.1)

--- 帖子 #380 ---
it's an indicator, not an EA

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I don't think so. As you can see in the pictures...the tickdata are perfect at this time.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Yes, correct, it is an indicator not an EA. sqaulou is currently working on the EA to try and add an optional input for trailing the last trade for better profitability.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now before I start tonight, I will be posting results for the Breakout Strategy only and then I will go over the rules of the 3 Tier Counter Trend Strategy and show some examples of entries, re-entries, stops, and closing trades.I do not want to start the new CT strategy in the middle of the week. This will allow all of you to look things over and see how the trades progress and practice. I will start the CT strategy fresh on Monday.

Here we go, I have adjusted the inputs on the indicator to allow the first target to represent a 1:1 R/R ratio in relation to the box size. Here are the settings I will be using from here on out:

TPFactor1= 1.0

TPFactor3= 2.618

TPFactor5= 423.6

By using a TPFactor of 1.0 to start allows us to have our Target 1 just outside the 38.2 and 61.8 extensions which is going to help prevent those quick reversals at the start of the session. Target 5 at the very extreme end of the extension levels (423.6) which is where most of the long runs will exhaust themselves and should be, idealistically, your farthest target. I've attached a pic to show where the levels are drawn in relation to the most common Fibonacci extensions.

I have also made the decision to extend my  "MaxBoxSizeInPips" input to 100 to lessen those spikes after the box is drawn when the "LimitBoxToMaxSize" has kicked in. (Gbp/Jpy will be set to 120). This may decrease the amount of trades taken by a little but profits should be higher as well, so it should offset each other in the long run.

You are using the M1 chart to run the EA, which is fine.

However, the EA uses the M15 data to determine re-entries.

If the M15 data is incorrect, then the EA will not re-enter properly, and this is what we are seing here.

Re-entries should occur only when an M15 bar has closed inside the box, which is obviously not the case in your chart if we try to draw 15-minutes "super-bars" out of the M1 chart.

Make sure you correctly (re-)built the M15 FXT files in tester/history from your Dukascopy tick data with the Dukascopy2FXT script.

Otherwize mt4 will rebuild it itself by using whatever is present (or missing!) in its history.

For instance, for some reason Alpari lacks historical data between march 13 till 26 (2010) on GU... (or maybe it's Metaquotes history, i never know where mt4 gets its hostorical data from the F2 window).

Okay, now to the rules of the new 3 tier Counter Trend (CT) Strategy. As I mentioned earlier, what we are looking to do instead of using the box for possible retraces, we will look to the Entry/Target 3 and the Entry/Sell target 3 as our pivot points for the retraces. Now just like the Breakout (BO) strategy, we are not going to have trades go our way all the time, just look at the Eur/Jpy BO tonight for a great example.

I will use the Eur/Jpy chart I just mentioned for my examples since it is relevant. All we are looking for for our entry is a touch of the Entry/Target 3, whether going up or down. This entry is a little different as we don't have to  wait for a candle to breach the box because, well, the Entry/Target 3 is outside  the box. A lot of times we will not have a candle close past Entry/Target 3 because it is a Fibonacci extension, so that is why we will allow just a touch for our entry. Targets are marked on the indicator so be sure to pay attention as we will have overlapping targets. For example, Sell Target 1 is also the Buy Target 2 and so forth. We close our trades the same as we would in the BO strategy (see pic 1). The stop for this is the next level past the Entry/Target 3, which is the Buy Target 4 and the Sell target 4.

Hello everybody

I have just joined FF but been here for quite some time. This is my first post in FF. I want to thank mer for this great system and Squalou for his contribution. Great work guys. You rock!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
The other thing you will notice is that at times we will have more than one set of trades open at a time. This example shows trades placed the next day before the remaining open trades were closed. Actually, the next day's trades were closed before the previous day's trades closed.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hello Mer,

Thank you and Squalou for new indy for CT option.

However I have noticed that your rules had changed and logic of taking positions is quite different to the one you have presented so far. Before CT rule was to take Sell on max box level and take buy on min box level. It was understandable for me becouse it reduced loses of retracements.

Can you explain why you have changed the rule?

Please also explain how many positions you open when signal is triggered? One or also five?

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I have changed the CT entries due to the fact you are more prone to see reversals at the Target levels rather than the edge of the box. The natural tendency is to see reversals at key Fibonacci extensions and we are not taking advantage of that by using the box edges for entries. We got creamed on the Eur/Usd this week and the CT concept is only a few weeks old, we needed a better solution.

Look at the way the BO strategy has so many trades that hit Target 1 and retrace back to the box edge or even to the opposite side targets. At the same time  the BO Target 1 is hit, we are entering a new CT trade in which we can make money on the reversal (see pic). Sometimes trades will open and close quick and some will run quite a ways. Some will get stopped out, which is expected, but that's where the multipliers come in. If a CT trade gets stopped out, most likely there is a coinciding BO trade that is hitting Target 2 at the same time and that trade may continue down even further. This is what will counteract the losses we incur along with the multipliers we use.

With regards to how many positions you enter, if you read the posts  earlier, I mentioned it is a 3 Tiered strategy. So we are entering the same 3 trades as the BO strategy and closing them out the same as well, except now you have additional targets to shoot for if you wish.

Ty,

works great with M15 Data!

Another thing I found out today: When I have an mini-acc with little margin, then the setting lot = 0.1 & risk = 1% became an error. look at pic

It happened two times with these settings. But some orders with these setting were ok!

Ok. I got your point.

I was confused about quantity of trades for CT after uploading new indy on the chart becouse I was not carefull enough and did not read your warning that is only simple rework of BO http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

I will wait with patience for final indy and EA for CT. The most important thing now is to settle correct levels , not too small and not too big http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif - easy to say but we will have a lot of forward testig in near future and this strategy is really worth it.

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Maybe your broker does not accept micro-acc (Lot 0.01).

Pressing F9 and try to manually set the volume to 0.01.

Then you will see whether it is possible or not.

Hi mer071898,

I would like to read the manual of the strategy is it available ??

thanks

--- 帖子 #398 ---
mer,

An applause  for your revisions. One step closer to greatness. Good Job. I now see a revision to the entries a future possibility. Keep up the good work. Don't take any loss lightly and don't stop eliminating them. Throw out that thought it is impossible to eliminate all of them.

It would be nice to see you post the results a little differently and more advantageous to you. The Martingale is good to eliminate prior losses but at this stage of the development process I believe you would see the weaknesses of the system quicker if you showed a column of 1. Losses, 2. Winners, and 3. Martingale applied. This way you see the losses first which is what you want to key on and improve upon.

When I first started writing EA's I also used a very aggressive Martingale system which worked very well but the the program always hit a brick wall as far as the amount of profit over a given period of time in back testing. The only way I could get the EA to produce more pips was to key on the losing trades. At first this proved correct as the profit went through the roof but as each loss was eliminated then my Martingale system didn't come into play because it only came into play after a loss. That's when I realized that another method needed to be added to the EA to maximize the results. The maximizing of the EA became an obsession as the total pip count went through the roof. The question in my mind was just how far could I take this thing.

I then added contracts as profits were won on each new trade and the pip count quadrupled. Again it was an extremely aggressive formula but still the end results were not quite there yet. You see I decided to learn about risk after losing 250K in one week on a back test which was similar to what you just experienced. I went looking for information on the subject and I found what I was looking for in an article on the internet. I applied the new formula to the EA. The end result was very impressive and almost as good as the two very aggressive methods, the contract adder system and the Martingale system put together.

All this with no addition to risk. I eventually took the Martingale out of my EA as it was no longer needed. I know you're not there yet but keep adjusting and you'll eventually get there. Nothing is impossible. You are already way ahead of where I was in the little time you started but I also had to teach myself how to write code.

Sorry for being so long winded.

Good Luck,

Johnny

Dear Johny,

I do not want to be rude but guys like you are quite annoyoing on forums. You do not add anything valuable to the thread or strategy itelf but only write how good moneymaking sytem you have developed.http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif - good for your but my life experince shows that internet forums are full of people like you. Only words words and words without any proofs. If you want to share your idea please do. Take example from Mer and Squalou - they really share their work and it is awesome !!!

I can also post here that I have 10 000 000 USD account a two Rols Royces with golden wheels - but it will be childish. I looked through history of your threads on FF and you keep the same style http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Do not get me wrong and feel free to add any real ideas that may help to develope this strategy - for example how to reduce martingale factor - as you mentioned in your post you have developed the way.

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #402 ---
If you're reading the thread, you're reading the "manual". There closest thing to a manual on here is in post # 271 where sqaulou has posted an unofficial manual for the EA.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
rlewan,

You missed the important points. The first point I was making was that mer and squalou are doing a great job. The second was a road map on how things can progress if you keep reaching for the stars. I do not post how much money I make but if success in designing systems is boasting to you then keep thinking that and you won't learn a thing. I don't need to prove anything but I will explain to you how you can do it.

This system isn't exactly new and the inventor I believe was Russian but I'm sure Mer and Squalou will take it to new heights given time. They are doing just fine and don't need or want anybodies help. If Mer wants the risk factor article I'd be more then happy to send it to him but he hasn't taken this program to that point yet. Let's let him work it out as he seems to want it that way. I'm guessing the revisions are far from over as these guys are starting to see the results.

If you were going to learn how to play golf would you listen to a golf pro or a golfer trying to be a golf pro. Only the golf pro has the experience and the knowledge. He's the only one who can explain how he broke the course record and what made it possible for him to achieve. He's earned the right to tell the story.

Humans keep records on everything so we can measure how far we have to go to break that record. Most people posting on these threads have little knowledge of how far they can go or what can actually be achieved. Most give up before learning much at all as their money is gone in a blink of an eye.

I'm only giving insight to what can be achieved and not to be happy with something less then perfection. A month from now Mer and Squalou will laugh at the 1.28 profit factor posted on the back test of their first EA. It will be 10 times that number at least. If not then I may post something but let's give them a chance to build this thing. The experience will last a life time.

1% risk may give you less than 0.01 lot result when the account margin is low.

that's why it's trying to open 0.00 lots (this is due to rounding down to nearest 0.01 multiplier).

You'll have to risk 2% (PER OPEN TRADE , that means 6% for the 3 trades) or maybe more...

SQ

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Ok. It make sence.

But than it should set automatically 0.01 lot if the percent set is smaller than 0.01lot.

if you're GMT+1, then you're in-sync with London that is DST currently, thus GMT+1. This means you should use 5-814 for box determination, not 6-914 .... you're 1hour late ;-)

I keep getting the same error. And I do have set ECN broker to TRUE.

I believe it happens when it tries to modify the order. I guess there should be a delay build in between open an order and modify. Because if I select "allow live trading" and also select "manual confirmation/authorisation" I manually open the 3 orders when the EA comes up with them and also manually confirm the modification order for the SL/TP points.

After deselecting the manual confirmation, the EA modifies the SL to BE without problems and closes the trades when it has to.

So it's only when automatic opening the 3 new orders.

Any suggestions how to solve this?

Broker is FXCM by the way.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Here is a quickfix you can apply to the code to get rid of the "INVALID STOPS" error (131) for those with ECN brokers.

Perhaps introducing a delay would also be needed.

If the following fix is not good enough, then i'll add a delay also.

This will be in the next release of the EA.

Don't forget to set "BrokerIsECN"  input to true;

replace this section:

Inserted Code     if (!brokerIsECN) {
ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, stoploss, takeprofit, comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);
if (ticket != -1) return (ticket);
} else {
ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, 0/*stoploss*/, [size=4][color=Red][b]takeprofit[/b][/color][/size], comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);
if (ticket != -1) {
if (stoploss!=0) _OrderModify(ticket, price, stoploss, takeprofit, expiration, arrow_color);
return(ticket);//success
}
}
with this:

Inserted Code     if (!brokerIsECN) {
ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, stoploss, takeprofit, comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);
if (ticket != -1) return (ticket);
} else {
ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, 0/*stoploss*/, [size=4][color=Red][b]0[/b][/color][/size], comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);
if (ticket != -1) {
if (stoploss!=0) _OrderModify(ticket, price, stoploss, takeprofit, expiration, arrow_color);
return(ticket);//success
}
}

As you can see, your _broker time is at GMT+0, while you are at GMT+2;

Charts are using Broker(=Server) time.

You box is shifted 1 hour LATER than Mer's settings.

You should subtract 1h from your box and session times settings (which i can't see on your pics...) to reach Mer's settings.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
If the first fix is not enough, here is the "delay" fix as well:

you might want to play with the "2000" (=2seconds) duration if it won't work...

Inserted Code     if (!brokerIsECN) {
ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, stoploss, takeprofit, comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);
if (ticket != -1) return (ticket);
} else {
ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, 0/*stoploss*/, [size=4][color=Red][b]0[/b][/color][/size], comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);
if (ticket != -1) {
[color=Red][b]         Sleep(2000);//wait before modifying the open order
[/b][/color]        if (stoploss!=0) _OrderModify(ticket, price, stoploss, takeprofit, expiration, arrow_color);
return(ticket);//success
}
}

Yes I understand that...but then is Mer's manual wrong, or not?

I have to set the time to 04:00 to 07:00 to become the same range like Mer!

Squalou...I hope you can fix this missunderstandings with the new EA-version

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Mer's "manual" in post #1  is not up-to-date: he has changed the box settings to be 6:00-09:14 (GMT+2).

That is confusing indeed...

SQ

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Ok, there we go. Now we have found "my" problem!

TY SQ

--- 帖子 #433 ---
But my "manual" is not wrong. I based the default time on GMT+0, which if we were not in British Summer Time would be 05:00 to 08:00. That is why if the times are really confusing you, I highly suggest to download the free time clock toward the bottom of the page at www.qlock.com and open up the London, England clock, then compare it to your MarketWatch in the terminal. As you can see in the pic, my MarketWatch is 1 hour ahead of my London time, that's why I have my settings at 06:00 to 09:14. It's really not that hard to figure out everyone.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Squalou and all,

Please DON'T USE THIS PATCH .... if your stoploss is too close to price action as per your broker requirements, you will have an OrderSend passed WITHOUT StopLoss (as it will be rejected ... but it comes after the ordersend has been accepted ... Outch ! ... unlikely in our case but who knows what is your set-up requirement for boxsizes) ..... in a breakout strategy, that may bring DOWN your account.

GMT/DST and ECN are both taken care of. I sent my code (that I use Live on Gomarkets = ECN, GMT+2) to Squalou for review (very little modifications compared to what Squalou already provided us with). He will review it and eventually release a new version soon.

Of note: once the GMT/DST modifications are integrated in the officiel release, you will not be able to backtest anymore (as it needs current time for time-shift determination). A different EA will need to be written for backtesting ... or will need to code a backtesting mode in the EA (not really complex but is it worth it ?)

Best advice, if you're lost with GMT/DST's (I would say do not use a break-out strategy LOL) and/or ECN-hache, wait ... pips will come soon enough. No rush is better than no more deposit !

I would like to suggest a way to control a runaway martingale sequence that could be incorporated within the system and EA. The purpose is to ensure that the current sequence for a pair is profitable and stops a possible runaway martingale sequence occurring.

I am a fan of martingale type sequences but anybody who is familiar with these sequences and mathematics knows that it is just a question of time before a sequence occurs that would cause the accounts ruination and thus it is necessary to stop or reduce the chances of such a sequence occurring.

To illustrate; if a sequence was at 89 (iteration 6) and TP2 has been attained but TP3 is not realised and gets stopped out at TP1 the current system would open the next trades at the same factor of 89. When continuing the next trades at the same factor 89 the probability of reaching a factor of ruination is high after, all it is only 3 or 4 factors further on. In other words these trades have to close a TP3 within the next 3 or 4 trades or the fat lady will sing. Factor 1597 (iteration 9) would margin a $20,000 account and a factor of 4181 (iteration 10) would blow away $50,000 assuming the initial orders were placed at 10 cents (0.01 lots) per order.

When the sequence hits TP2 and TP3 is stopped out at factor 89 (iteration 6) there are significant profits; 1482 pips, (36% of the pairs accumulated losses at the MinBoxSizeInPips=25) in fact it is 36% profit from iteration 4. If the sequence is then restarted at iteration 1 (Factor 1) then this would effectively break a loosing run or at the very least make it more manageable retaining a profit and the account.

The idea would be to have a EA input parameter that allowed the trader to specified an iteration level (Martingale Factor) commensurate with their own risk profile, once the sequence was at this level then when the trades next hit TP2 and TP3 is stopped out be it 'x' iterations later a new sequence would be initiated.

Thanks to both Mer and Squalou

--- 帖子 #436 ---
From my past experience, and now I understand better what Mer told me, the current thread is about the strategy in itself ... not MM. What ever MM, it is useless without proper strategy entry and exit points.

that is the purpose of the thread ... the EA is simply a mean to test faster some ideas. Test yours and let us know.

Again, I had the same reaction in the previous thread but it's by improving the very strategy that Mer came to V2, not by improving MM.

Just sharing my experience

There are always users who have a difficulty with the time window.

I can especially picures only for the EA, the GMT (for example, to take) so that all users use the same window of time.

Also, you can adjust the GMT offset automatically.

Perhaps this indi helps.

OMG ..... not really complex ... I was probably drunk when I wrote that ... the problem is: what is the day of the year that corresponds to last sunday of march and last sunday of October (and eventually make this code simple enough that it shall be embedded in a function so that it is re-usable fr te big-dog breakout) ?

Well, it's a mess, taking into account leap years, day shift and everything. Basically, I spent 1hour checking on the internet and answers are in the following book:

I'll spend some time on it ... cannot tell when it will be finished. Until then, every backtest is .... definitly not accurate.

G'day Mer.  I thought I had read all the posts but I have missed something somewhere.  I have V3.1 on my charts which has the same values for TP's1, 2 and 3 as V2.1.  But on your charts you have TP1 to be about the same as the box size.  Which version are you using and can you recall in which post this was discussed?

5 digit brokers need everything multiplied by 10, 30 pip stop looks like 3 to them. So 30 pip stop is sent as 300 pip.

I don't know if that's your problem, but it can be a problem.

Dear traders,

Since last Monday I take positions on GBP/USD, EUR/USD or USD/CHF based on your breakout system with for now nothing but winners!

Just keep in mind that I trade temporarily manually (no EA) and only wish

to get out on Target 1 on Buy or Sell entries.

For practical reasons I have no time to wait until an entry level is triggered,

so I use a script where I place OCO orders instead. So I am sure I never miss the boat if an opportunity arises.

Since I am satisfied with a daily gain of about 30 pips, I do not need to attend further more during the rest of the day.

Gilbert.

with ECN brokerz, there's NO choice: trades MUST be sent with NO SL and NO TP, and then must be modified to setup the SL+TP.

This leaves open any sort of "manipulation" you could imagine between those two non-atomic operations...

like a fictive "server connection problem", modify refused, fictive "server busy" errors, etc...

especially when you will start reving up your lot sizes to try to recoup losses...

I let you figure out the possible outcomes...

Hi Squalou

I have an instance where the pair hit TP1 and the EA only modified TP3 to BE but no order was sent to modify TP2 by the EA, (I do not mean a failed order, there is no record of the EA attempting to send an order). The price action retraced and closed TP3 at BE leaving TP2 open, the EA did not open a new set of orders when the price again exceeded the entry position which I looks correct as an order is still open. Still waiting to see if TP2 was modified when the price action attained TP1 position. See attached image which explains everything.

I checked the VPS / windows logs and can confirm that there was not some other event or issue that prevented this order being sent to modify the TP2.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
And that was wise my friend. You should not ordersend before making sure your StopLoss will be accepted for your Ordermodify or you may end-up with a free ride to blowing you account simply because you have no stoploss in your order.

Now for the impatient, and because I can't stand ppl blowing there account - Squalou for you review (I use this Live with success and it maches exactly Mer's chart, but it's up to you, I made no recommendation):

EA:  Attached File(s)   LBO_3 Tier London Breakout EA.V2- XMod.mq4

50 KB
|
652 downloads

- ECN fix, GMT/DST fix and automatic - SQUALOU: this is a cleaner code than what I sent you earlier ... it allows to leave your code almost exactly as -is.

Indicator:  Attached File(s)   GMT-offset.mq4

3 KB
|
591 downloads

- if you have this one, replace yours with it as I modded it also (but did not rename)

Library:  Attached File(s)   GMT_DST_TimeMod.mq4

2 KB
|
547 downloads

- if the above indicator works fine (which I believe), then this should take care of everything.

This will automatically take care of everything for you, specifically in terms of GMT/DST, and you should have an EA that matches exactly the charts posted by Mer. If not, please provide your GMT as given by the indi, your borker's name and any error message (there should not be if you run windows and if previous squalou versions were working). For the geeky ones, I will try this code on Linux/Wine as this is my personal trading server's configuration.

This will work for backtesting and for Live account (I use this Live, but it's up to you, I made no recommendation).

For backtesting, you need to manually set GMT_Datasets and BacktestingMode = true

For Live, Set BacktestinMode = false and NoTradeLastDSTWeek = true

This is not perfect yet, the NoTradeLastDSTWeek shall be obselete soon as it simply prevents from trading the last week of March and October as I don't have the means to determine which day is the last sunday of March and October (the DST time switch).

However, I think I have that issue taken care of considering there is 31 days in both Months and that Sunday is either one of 25 to 31 dates .... so I may simply check for this. I will keep you posted.

Let me know if this does not work for you.

I consider this my contribution to Mer's and Squalou efforts. Now, considering this is fully automatic, How much time until we find this one through a commercial offer ?

From there, I would do the following:

- there should be some mechanism in place to prevent passing order 2 and 3 in case order 1 failed ( I don't think that exists yet)

- write a log file with the major variable to recover from a Metatrader crash

What is your agenda Squalou? Like I said, I will contribute eventually further.

hi all, i love this thread. similar to the 1 minute daily system but better, has an EA and martingale.

ive only read pages 1-4, the page where CT was introduced and the last 2. 30 is alot to get through.

gilbert- this is a gd way of trading the system, i also would prefer only one BO trade per session as i think when 1st TP is not hit  (3 losses) this hurts us.. if the strike rate is good 1 trade is all thats needed.

You said on Monday you have had no losers on GU, EU and UCH. I have my time /charts set to the same as yours and get the following -

(added EJ, GJ and UC as mer suggested)(Y=TP, N=SL)

16-20 aug:-----------------------------

GU: YNYNY 60% WR

EU: NNYYY 60% WR

UCH: YNNYY 60% WR

EJ: YYNYY 80% WR

GJ: YNYNY 60% WR

UC: YYYYY 100% WR

A RANDOM WEEK aug 2-6--------

GU: YNYYY 80% WR

EU:  YYYYN 80% WR

UCH: NNYYY 60% WR

EJ:  YNYYY 80% WR

GJ:  YYNNY 60% WR

UC:  YNNNY 40% WR

The av of these results gives a 68% win rate. Assuming this rate is constant, this is a good system!

I guess an average of win ratio over this year would give a better story.

mer/ squalou, is it pos to run the EA with only 1 trade?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Another thought on martingale. (im not a hater)

I guess the best way to use the EA is to backtest without mart. Find the best pair time, WITH THE LOWEST LOSERS IN A ROW, then trade it with mart?

The prob i see with the martingale aspect is if we get a run of losses it all over. Mer’s post 442 shows a multiplier of 34 (only the 5th losing trade gets x 34)

1st trade = .01 lots. If SL = 3 trades @ MM loss (say 2%) = -2%

2nd trade = .02 lots. If SL = 3 trades = -4%                                               running total -6%

3rd trade = .05 lots. If SL = 3 trades = -10%                                             running total -16%

4rd trade = .13 lots. If SL = 3 trades = -26%                                             running total -42%

5rd trade = .34 lots. If SL = 3 trades = -68%                                             running total -110%

So if the 5th lot of trades fail its bust? I could be adding wrong.

Back to the lowest losers in a row part, if this is below 3 or 4 in a row we wont be bust (always in fear tho). The other thing to do would be to lower the mart sequence risk.

Just constructive criticism, i want this to work as much as everyone else.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
There is not an option for that at this time but I'm sure sqaulou already has that idea running through his brain. We are currently looking to work out the bugs first and then we will be looking into possibly adding or modifying options.

I know it's a pain in the butt, but you really must read through the whole thread. I've mentioned several times that this is a strategy that needs capital to work properly. Now there are some that have used a much milder martingale series with success, but that is up to the individual trader.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Okay, here are the results for Monday. I will continue from Friday with the results as normal for the Breakout strategy, but the Counter Trend strategy will be fresh as of today.

Let remember the rules for the new CT strategy:

1.)  Enter on a breach of the "Entry/ Buy target 3" or "Entry/Sell Target 3" from either direction. If entering a trade towards the box, Target 4 must be triggered first. This will prevent whiplashing back and forth across our entry point and will guarantee that our current series will close before the a series is opened.

2.) We will only manage one series of trades at a time, unless a new box has formed in which new entries can be placed even if there are still open trades from the previous day. Only re-enter same day trades if a target has been triggered or stopped out. Again, as stated above, this will prevent whiplashing back and forth across our entry point and will guarantee that our current series will close before the a series is opened.

3.) Close T1 and T2 trades as normal. Close your T3 trade at Target 3 as normal if you wish, but for testing purposes I will be leaving the T3 trade run until either Target 5 is reached or stopped out on a retrace. This way Target 2 is "locked in" and we can have more pips to bank if the trade goes our way.

@Squalou:

Today, with v1.1, the EA went short @ the breakout of EURUSD.

But when reaching the TP1, SL2 and SL3 didn't move to BE (+1pip)

I am using an ECN-broker.

Is there something wrong in the EA in the ECN-code? (maybe only when going short with this EA like mentioned in post #298.

Or is it caused by the spread, like mentioned before in posts #319, #320 and #323?

Just bringin it to your attention. Sorry to bother if it is the "fault" of my broker

By the way. Good work guys!!

Incredible what amount of work you've done so far! I'm grateful for it.

Dear JulesvH,

First, can you reproduce the potential bug in backtest (with today's data) ?

Second, can you reproduce the potential bug with the version I posted earlier and where I did modify the ECN code ( ... using the "temporary fix" as suggested may lead, as I explained, to an order being passed without SL being approved of) ?

I used the code I provided earlier (V2-modded by XmPh few post ago) and everything is OK, I was not able to reproduce the potential bug).

Finally, any error message in your terminal ?

thx for the feedbacks.

New setting EA 3 Tier London EUR/USD ForexPlace.

2009/03/20 to 2010/08/24

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi

what's your setting?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Squalou,

I've been playing around with the MaxBoxSize and using low numbers and notice your code is centering the box on the Median. This approach I believe would cause more false breakouts.

If the price within the box is moving to a high pivot then moving the top of the box down will make the price break through the box top and a buy will take place. If the box extents is recoded so the High or Low whichever came last is the bottom or the top of the box and the box is extended from that point would be a better box position.

The box is depicting the high and low and a break through of these levels is considered significant enough to signal a buy or sell. The last occurrence of this is the most significant in drawing the box as it is the London Break out. An additional pip or two above the high would be wise for the top of the box as this high point can be revisited often as it is a line of resistance.

This can be seen happening five different times on the EURUSD on the August 23 with the MaxBoxSizeInPips set low enough that the high was above the box. The high pivot reached 1.2729 within the box and 1.2727, 1.2718, 1.2712, 1.2723, 1.2725 and 1.2722 occurred on retraces towards that resistance level. All bounced down close to that level but never reached or broke through the 1.2729 high.

In this example it never became a problem because the price never broke through the top of the box but then again it could become one even on higher box size settings.

Just an observation.

Hi,

First of all, I would like to thank mer for starting this great thread and also

thank SQ who made it possible to do it with ea.

keep it short, I want to point out that i found some interesting

backtesting results with several pairs which showed gradual loss.

that was interesting because if I buy instead of sell or I sell instead of

buy ( that would be CT method ) it can turn up the result up side down.

I just changed TP/SL and without martingale I let it run for past five years

which kind of cover almost all kinds of market condition.

I attached one example which can turn into good result with CT EA.

I will go through more backtests with different settings and different pairs.

I appreciate all who contribute this thread to work things better and

I look forward to see SQ's CounterTrend EA on this one. that will be great

combination with BreakOut EA.

This is first time to post on FF and Thank you guys again for great work!

Hi Jules,

This issue is not related to the ECN problem.

I can reproduce it in backtest (Alpari data) on EURJPY on Aug.18:

Backtest on EURJPY from aug.18 to aug.20, 2010;

Settings are "regular" times/box size:

StartTime="06:00"

EndTime="09:14"

SessionEndTime="04:00"

MinBoxSizeInPips=5

MaxBoxSizeInPips=80

LimitBoxToMaxSize=true

TP1Factor=1.000

TP3Factor=2.618

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Trade 4 hits TP1, but trades 5&6 go to initial SL...

We'll have a fix soon.

SQ

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi SQ,

when will the next EA come?

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I have added that option for the coming release

You'll just need to set your TP3Factor to 0 to keep only Trade 1 with TP1 and remove trades 2&3.

SQ

--- 帖子 #475 ---
We should probably leave TP2 & TP3 in there for those who like trades to run  and instead have the option to open 1, 2, or 3 trades.

Hi Johnny,

I'm sure you would have been banned from any of SteveHopwood's threads long ago with your previous posts...

I'm glad you are now getting to useful posts at last...

This is an interesting observation indeed.

The box is formed of 4 parameters: EXTENT in TIME and PRICE, and POSITION in TIME and PRICE.
We have been focussing on the 3 first parameters, and left quite appart the box POSITION in PRICE until now.

And this is clearly a key factor in the success/quality of the breakout, as you are pointing out.

We should play around with that parameter as well, and i think your remark about S/R is truly relevant here.

Centering the box on its median price was a first approach to limit its extent while still allowing trading it, but it might very well not be the best we can do here.

Let's see how we can improve this parameter.

Your suggestion of using the most recent high(resp. low) price to setup the box high (resp. low) edge clearly goes in that direction.

Now the other parameter would be how many pips of "buffer" should we use?
This is another factor to be optimized.

We definitety have to explore this path.

Thanks Johnny for being constructive, finally...

We need some "taskforce" to do that, guys...

please contribute as you can.

Hi Sq.

Today trade on GBPUSD had a serious problem.Candel of market touched the entry buy or entry sell so your EA actuated many times,and suddenly it reversed and went the reverse path and oscillated between two entry buy and entry sell, and it didn't have any good performance in oscillating markets.

Do you have any plan to compensate this problem ?

I apologize you because I'm not good English.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Many times? If you look at my chart above, it was only triggered twice. This is going to happen all the time, so you better get use to it. That is why we have added the martingale aspect to the strategy so we can recoup those losses when this situation occurs. You might want to go back a re-read the thread from the beginning because you do not have a full grasp of how this strategy works yet.

thanks for your kindness

--- 帖子 #485 ---
ok, so, after JohnnyBSmart remarks in post 469, and my reply in post 476,

i have modified the Indi and the EA to allow us to explore further into this direction.

Attached are the modified version of the indi and the EA.

EA Version 1.2b: !!! EDIT#2: v1.2b replaces the v1.2a posted earlier today !!!

!!! i have uploaded a fixed v1.2b here;
- v1.2a fixes a bug when using the Martingale options with only 1 Trade (TP3Factor set to 0).

- v1.2b fixes a bug in the "StickBoxToLatestExtreme", which was sticking the box to the highest price only (never on the lowest price...)

(Note: i have not yet included fixes for the "trade 2&3 not being moved to BE+1" issue, still debugging it...)

- Added "StickBoxToLatestExtreme" input:

when true, the box will "stick" to the box high or low, whichever comes last; else it will be centered on the EMA(box_time_range) value;

(applies when "LimitBoxToMaxSize" is true)

Other changes in EA v1.2:

- when "TP3Factor" is set to 0, Trades 2 & 3 will NOT be sent; only Trade 1 will be used.

- fixed session time calculation issues seen when running MT4 on Linux (thanks to xmph).

NOTE about adding a "buffer" to the box, as suggested by JohnnyBSmart as well: this can be achieved at the moment by playing with the "LevelsResizeFactor" input, setting it to a value > 1.0 will create some "buffer" pips, that will be variable as it is a factor of the box size.

I have not added a clear "BoxBufferInPips" input yet, but this could be done if we(you) find it easier to handle/understand it this way...

=========

Indicator v.3.2a: !!! EDIT: version v.3.2a also has the fix for "StickBoxToLatestExtreme";

- Added "StickBoxToLatestExtreme" input: same as in the EA v1.2;

Backtesters, get set, ready, GO!

Let's see what we can gain from this.

SQ

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I had that in mind as another option.

I wanted to avoid adding a new input, and the code changes where very limited(=quick!).

I might just as well recode it that way...

thx

SQ

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Squalou, I see that you modify the ECN code for:
Inserted Code ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, 0/*stoploss*/, 0/*takeprofit*/, comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);
if (ticket != -1) {
if (stoploss!=0 || takeprofit!=0) {
Sleep(2000);//wait before modifying the open order
_OrderModify(ticket, price, stoploss, takeprofit, expiration, arrow_color);
what happen if, due to spread and price action, or most probably a delayed order,  you have a StopLoss >= Ask- [(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_STOPLEVEL)+MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_SPREAD))*Point];

well you end up with an order that passed without StopLoss ... and if it reversed you are F*"/$%

Doesn't happen ..... well that happened to me on the first day I live traded the system because I set-up the BoxSize to 20, I had a 4spread against me, a 3 slippage and some delay in my order .... went all the way back to .... the other side take profit .. Hmmm not good (hopefully everything is recovered since then).

So if I may, I reiterate the fact that this should be coded as follows (while creating another loop to handle MinSL issues):
Inserted Code double MinSL = (MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_STOPLEVEL)+MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_SPREAD))*Point;
// SLPrice will store the Long or Short StopLoss price.
double SLPrice;

if (type == OP_BUY) {SLPrice = NormalizeDouble(Ask,Digits) - MinSL;}
else {SLPrice = NormalizeDouble(Bid,Digits) + MinSL;}

if ((type == OP_BUY) && (stoploss <= SLPrice) )
{ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, 0/*stoploss*/, 0/*takeprofit*/, comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);}
else if ((type == OP_SELL) && (stoploss >= SLPrice) )
{ticket = OrderSend(symbol, type, lots, price, slippage, 0/*stoploss*/, 0/*takeprofit*/, comment, magic, expiration, arrow_color);}
else {Print("Error: SL @Buy does not respect Broker Minimal SL for OrderModify: Desired = ", stoploss, "Minimal = ", SLPrice);return(-1);}

if (ticket != -1) {
_OrderModify(ticket, price, stoploss, takeprofit, expiration, arrow_color);

Another solution would be to have a function that checks every order at every tick and assure that a StopLoss is present for every orders, eventually to integrate that mechanism in your OrderCheck/OrderManage function. Which way would you like to go ?

I will finalize the GMT/DST code so that it will be ready for next release.

Thx for providing more input so as to "play" around with the box size .... I think this shall be dynamically determined based on price action if there is specific sign that volatility is high for example.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I have updated post #485 with fixed versions.

Please reload them from there.

I haven't integrated the last changes from xmph on previous post yet, so there WILL be new updates to the EA soon.

(sorry xmph, too many things happening in too short timeframe...)

However, you can use the EA v1.2b for backtesting, and for non-ECN brokerz.

I had the same idea as Johny BSmort about fake breakouts and would be good to add option as pip buffer and (or else),all can sett it as they want (as spread is wide etc..)... and was wondering why 2 and 3 trades doesn't come to BE +1 ??

and have seen that great team (squalou first) are working on it...great guys !!!

ECN brokers still refuse trades (ie. wrong SL.)...

there is another idea I want to tell...like would be good if and  when second trade reach level 2 to move 3th trade to 2cond level +1 like new BE...coz many times I have seen that 3th trade just fail.... all this as optional tools....

and is good idea that can be martingaled just 1st trade .sounds clever...

great job guys

sorry about my bad english

cheers to all

Hello squalou,

Gee thanks for the back-handed compliments.  I have never been on any of SteveHopwood's threads and actually have posted on very few threads. I've been banned more then once and for the dumbest reasons. People think I'm just plain crazy when I start talking about trading and especially when the discussion leads to EA's. You and Mer are going down the same path so be careful.

The trading methods I see posted on most threads are of little value as they are not designed around any real intelligence. I trade from support to resistance and back again and find indicators as mostly useless pieces of code.

The Fibs are support and resistance levels as big money traders seem to use these thingies and thus have become useful SR levels. I still look at true SR's for reversals and when they line up with the Fibs it's dynamite.

You may find the profit factor on back testing hitting the roof and your tax liability following if you start making changes like this. The brokers will start banning you from trading.

Have a great day,

Johnny

The pic I posted was for Tuesday's results, not today. But yes, I see where Wednesday (today) was rough on the Gbp/Usd, but we should all know days like this will happen.

Thanks Squalou for your latest version. Just running it on the tester, I've noticed the bugs you can see in the pic attached.

The initial buy order was taken correctly, however after tp, when price came down, the next buy was taken not at the box buy line but some pips 10 pips higher. I've noticed that on the tester on more than one day.

Its also not taking any sells.

Just thought I'd bring it to your attention.

thanks

sasan1000,

If you place a  fib retracement indicator from Tuesday's high to Tuesday's low you will find the price oscillating at the 50% level which is always the norm. To combat this all you have to do is readjust the box which is now very easy as Squalou has adjusted the code. If you move the box so the 50% retrace line is above or below and use a small box size the price will oscillate from profit to profit level.

This program is geared to the London Open but it will work at any time of the day. I don't use this as advertised as I want to be in the trade at the open and use the buy and sell levels as take profit levels as they are actually lines of support and resistance.

Mer uses these lines as confirmation the price will continue to move up or down once the price breaks through these levels which is correct but the price has to actually break through and not just touch as the price is just as likely to bounce off these levels as break through them. If I get a break through I close one(1) order if I get a retrace down after a cross up I sell all remaining Long orders. I only reenter at the next fib level or other thingies I have over-laid on this template which could be up or down as this line has now become a support line. You can set your own Fib levels or adjust the settings.

I hope this helps,

Johnny

again good idea, excelent one to trade with 50% H_L daily ! do I understand good ?

you said that the box should be sett with pivot line ??? and you said it should be above or below 50 % Fibo, what is pivot line (isn't ?) ....but aint be better to put pivot in the midlle of the box ??? and I dont understand well if you putt box below or above pivot line ( is that depends  of trend, if it  is up or down???)

can you  explan little better please.

I dont know what I am doing wrong, but can't put box in or out Pivot line (H_L daily), today (EURUSD) even if I wanted to sett time like 01-04 to put pivot in the midlle of the box, EA still said  buy trade 1.2735 etc.....

can you please explain how I should do it correctly ???

thanks and cheers to you and all others

Hey,

I had same problems. You MUST test/trade this strategy with M15-Candles because there are special rules for this trade which can only work with M15

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Thanks watcherkb, I'll do that.

Pardy

Pardy,

please use a white chart background to display the colors properly (F8 to set the colors).

So you can actually see what the EA prints in the Comment area (up-left corner);

In particular it shows the buy/sell entry prices and TP1 levels;

You can actually load the template that Mer has on post #1, and copy it "tester.tpl" AND also as "default.tpl" in your (mt4)/templates folder.

That way charts will use the same template when opening new charts or a backtest result chart.

The displayed trades show BUY orders being taken inside the sell-TP area, all at the same price, and same TP, the last one seem to be taken at the opposite "box"

What i think may happen here is that you have loaded the Indicator with the "default" settings on the backtest result chart, BUT the EA is configured with DIFFERENT box/Factors settings, so you get "silly" looking results because the indi shows box and levels that are different from those used by the EA.

This is a possible reason.

Make sure that you are loading the Indicator with the same settings as the EA.

You CAN run/backtest on M1, M5, or M15 timeframes, there should not be any difference unless your M1, M5 or M15 history data is incomplete, which happens quite often...

Hi SQ,

in another thread you said I must use M15-timeframe....

http://www.forexfactory.com/search.p...duser&u=136405

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Thanks Sq,

I'll re-reun it making sure to check the settings on the tester each time.

On the tester I do not run the indicator, letting the ea draw the box for me.

Big thanks once again, tho'.

Pardy

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I think i said the EA uses M15 data for re-entries which does not mean it needs to run on M15 chart. (quote me if i'm not remembering correctly)

As long as the history data is correct, the EA should work fine on any timeframe charts (in "every tick" backtest mode).

SQ

--- 帖子 #511 ---
The box and levels are drawn by the EA with the same values as the ones used to trigger trades.

I cannot see why the EA would draw the box and levels differently than the trades it triggers.

Another pix with the correct color scheme and showing the "comment" area as well as the box and levels lines would help.

The Journal also contains useful information on the computed box and levels, and the trades taken.

Thanks, re-testing again as you advised. BTW, have sent you a pm.

Is there any possibility of having an option of the first break even stop in the EA set at a different time than when the first target is reached? In manual back testing I had dramatically better results when I set the stop to break even when price had reached about 2/3 of the way to the first target. On the majority of trades, by the time price had gotten that close to the target, it either went all the way or reversed to a loss. Very few times did it get stopped out and then go back to hit the target. The net gain was much better with the stop set that way, prevented quite a few losses. At least in manual testing. I also like the idea of the buffer for the entry. In the manual tests I only entered when price broke out of the box by at least 1 pip. This prevented a few false entries. Setting it any higher than that didn't seem to help much, just cut into the profits and even a buffer of 5-10 pips didn't prevent the ranging trades. But that's where the break even stop at 2/3 the distance from target 1 helped. This was generally in the 18-25 pip range.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I have similar observation as yours, but a slightly different conclusion. SL must be adjusted based on price action (not a predefined level), and so the box shall be guided in the manner described by John.

However, if we start to do this, I think we will diverge from the current "London Breakout" to a more dynamic, eventually less and less correlated to the London Session. What is your view on the matter Mer ? For or against a dynamic Box extent and price-action based SL ?

Personally, I'm fine with the box extent, but I do move manually (if in front of my computer) the SL of order 2 and 3 at BE if current price is 2/3 of my first target, and I lock in some profits as well. However, I did not backtest such "behavior" on a long-time period. This will be my next move ... you sometimes it appears good on 1month, and it decreases profits over a year !

X.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Squalou,

On the attached chart the box on the left should be down at the bottom. The box on the right is correct. This is the only box I have noticed that is not correct. Have you noticed this happening? Please disregard all the squiggly lines.

After further review I believe you are including all the box extents into the determination of the box position. The Box Start and Box End should be used to determine the last high or low pivot then the box size should be drawn from that point.

Cheers,

Johnny

Manual back testing takes *forever* and I was trying to figure out a way for myself to place manual trades at a time other than 3am (I am in Florida). After some scanning of the charts I settled upon a box time that worked quite well for the Eur/Jpy (possibly even better than the normal London setting).  I set the box time to 00:00-05:00 (this is 5pm-10pm EST, yes a 5-hr box) with a max box of 75 and the original level settings (.618 and 2), and session end time of 20:00.  (I also tried out the indicator someone made with setting the max box size according to ATR and that did give somewhat better results.)

For the back testing purposes, I only counted trades that I would be able to place manually.... pending buy and sell orders at 10pm and then re-entries if applicable from 8am to 1pm EST.  I tested with these settings and the first break-even stop placed once price reached about 2/3 the way from target 1, and only placing orders/trades when price breached the box by 1 pip.  In my back testing, I did take spread into account.  Tested from Jan '09 to present. Also, no martingale strategy. You would have to net 100,000 pips at .01 lots to make the same amount of money as netting 1000 pips with 1 full lot. My personal preference is larger lots, no martingale.  Anyway, the e/j with these settings netted about 1300 pips per month in 2009 and about 1000/mo in 2010.  The break even stop at 2/3 the distance from target 1 gave dramatically better results over this time period, from Jan 2009 to present.

The London box times work really well with the g/u, e/u and u/c. The e/u and u/c also work most of the time with New York settings, a box time from 5am-8am est.  But there are so many variables, different times, different box sizes, different target levels, different ways to set the break even stop.... that I just have not had the time to do any more manual tests, and currently the ea doesn't quite have the parameters I need.  I've tried some back tests with the ea using the settings I used with the e/j and did not get the same results. After looking over the ea back tests results, the reasons it did not come out the same were 1) the ea does not reliably move the break even and other stop losses on trades 2 and 3, 2) the ea does not have a buffer for trade entries, 3) the ea cannot place the first break even stop at 2/3 the distance from target 1.  There may be other reasons, too, but those are probably the main ones. So far I have not been able to get any good results from the ea with any settings, nothing even close to the results I got with the manual testing (yes, I have the newest version). I am also trading it live with the e/j with the same methods I used with the manual back testing and am getting the same good results.  I'd like to trade the e/u and u/c in the morning after I get up, but have not had time to do any manual testing for those for any length of time, and am waiting on it until I can.  Even though those two are similar, the c/u seems to work much better with the New York box times.

Although I have made some adjustments that suit me personally, all in all I think this is a great 5-star system and completely applaud mer and squalou for their efforts and excellent work on the system, the indicator and the ea

argon,

Here are two charts depicting the same time of day. One shows the London open settings and the second shows the box at the NY Session Low. All I did is reset the time in the Input Box.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #518 ---
i do get the correct box when i set my box time to match yours...

You are using the latest (v3.2a) version of the indi, as the previous one would not stick ANY box to the low side (the box next to your invalid one does stick to the low edge).

The Indi uses M1 data to determine the most precise hi/lo times, not the current chart's TF (M15), to try to prevent boxes where the hi and lo would be on the same M15 bar (where would we stick the box in that case ?).

Perhaps your M1 data is incomplete in that time area.

Try switching to M1 on this chart, and see if all bars are displayed within that box time, and if the box is still wrong on the M1 chart.

Can't find any better answer yet...

SQ

--- 帖子 #519 ---
That was not my understanding of your explanation.

Quoting you from post 469:

Can you clarify ?

SQ

--- 帖子 #520 ---
That could be a good idea.

An input to specify at what position (factor?) within Entry~TP1 to move to BE would do it ?

Something like "MoveToBEAtTP1Factor" = 0.66 ?

Default would be 1.0, so we move to BE at TP1(*1.0).

?

That's my roadmap for the week...

Hi squalou

Thanks for the achievement u did in cooperation w Mer...

Pls allow me to put some questions in order to enhance the use of this EA (....v1.2b)

1- MagicNumber=0

Do we hv to change the magicnumber everytime we create a new chart

2- Do we hv to put both : Indic and EA, on the chart

3- SessionEndTime= 02:00---- is it 02:00 AM of tomorrow or 02:00 PM of today?

4- Can we put (SessionEndTime= 23:45) ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hello Squalou,

That would be great improvement but can we move BE before hitting TP1? I think it will help to lock some pips in case of chart reverse. It will be some kind of initial/safe TP. Is my thinking logic? What do you guys think?

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I think that would be a good way to do it, consistent with the way the ea works using factors. Just eyeballing the charts, that does seem to be a good idea, kudos to the guy who worked it out.

Pardy

Hello Squalou,

If I want to run latest version of this EA on two separate charts for the same pair ( EUR/USD ) but with different box times ( on first London brekaout on the second New York breakout ) shall I do anything with Magic Number ?

Thaks and regards,

RL

--- 帖子 #525 ---
yes, you'll have to make them different magic numbers, that's the purpose of magics

Yes, I think that would work extremely well!

celticheart,

What was your MaxPipBox setting? Was this at the start of the London Open or did it occur later?

Now that an option to have the box fixed to a pivot high or low as a user option then the opposing box level is just an arbitrary number of pips above the pivot and may or more likely is not a support or resistance level. Breaking through this level has no real meaning and from what I see is not contributing to the profitability of the trade and is actually detrimental to the profit.

If the trade is a successful trade then it is more then likely it started from a major pivot or at least a minor one. If this is true which I think is quite obvious then a lot of pips are lost on getting to the buy point. If this buy point is indeed a resistance level then we have the real possibility the price will bounce and reverse direction.

It seems to do this quite often and when this happens we not only have the real possibility of a reverse after a break through which just cost us some profit getting to the trading point and a loss of the trade but now we are in a wrong way trade. The Price now has to retrace across the same box extents to get to the bottom side to make another trade thus another profit opportunity is lost. A good example of this is the GBPUSD on Wednesday as seen on post #500. This is akin to filling a bath tub from a water well fifty yards away with a leaky bucket. If you add up all the lost opportunity costs to the trade costs it is a very expensive way to trade and one I won't be trading anytime in this lifetime.

I really like the look of the box as it highlights what has taken place before the open and the start of the open and noticed this idea about three years ago but didn't have an MT4 platform. I tried adjusting the box size to 5 pips and then using the LevelsResizeOption but that just increases the box size as well as the take profit levels.

My observation is the box should be placed forward or backward to hit the pivot dead on so the box floats and thus the extents are not rigid. I do this now visually at the open and manually thereafter. A pivot calculation is as simple as a left strength/right strength formula and a value of 3-1 or 3-2 would find the pivot. This would eliminate the sell short orders being placed on exhausted down moves which is just throwing money away in a wrong way trade. I've noticed most days the first trade or two are losers before the direction is right and a profitable trade takes place. This is not a normal event of a well designed system.

Once the pivot is found then the direction the price is heading is pretty obvious. The only thing still unknown is the strength of the move from the pivot point. That is why wasting pips from the pivot to the buy point is not a wise decision. Who needs 30, 50 or 80 pips to figure out price direction. By that time I'm usually taking some profit off the table?

Once the price gets up a head of steam in the right direction arbitrarily taking profit as the price rockets up at some preset level seems like another leaky bucket. Only on a retrace down to or below these levels will I take profit. A good example of this is the GBPUSD on August 19th. I believe in taking money off the table but there's a right way and a wrong way. The price action which oscillates up and down may of hit these profit levels on a downward move before going back up anyway but I don't want it to be by system design.

Having 1000, 2000, 5000 and higher pip losses before I bet 250 plus more contracts on the next trade to bail me out so my wife doesn't divorce me is not what I'm going to do even if I'm well funded. I don't believe anybody here is going to do it either as the risks of even trading partial contracts like this is way to high.

I know from experience that all of these issues can be worked out with everybody helping with the ideas and the discussion. Let nobody take issue with an idea until it is discussed and thought out thoroughly. The best of ideas come from the most unlikely of people and places.

Let's just do it,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #529 ---
xmph,

Once the increase in volume and the market defines direction and the move is made it is no longer a London breakout move but a secondary move brought on by many different factors. If no factors exist then big money will make it move in one direction and then the other anyway.

Moving the box and viewing the market from a new perspective is only logical and I believe more profitable. A trailing stop as has been discussed in a previous post would solve your 2/3 of the way to the target issue or additional levels with the retrace across them signaling a taking of profit. These do not have to be plotted on the screen and only need to be part of the code.

Happy Trades,

Johnny

sorry another issue with the martingale approach.

Please treat this as constructive..

mer, in previous posts you’ve stated a big bank is required to run this system successfully. do you know how big?

i believe the worst run of luck has been 5 losses, making the next trades at multi x 89? next being x 225?

i think its great all these people are perfecting entrys and exits, but as the win ratio is only around 60-65% a string of bad trades is inevitable.

i think someone with time needs to do a spreadsheet calculating the bank required to withstand 5,6 7 loosing trades is a row (1 pair), thus telling us the required bank to trades this system.

Say the min bank to trade up to 8 losses and miss a margin call is $20k, who of us has this? this makes the system un tradable to the small guy. who with a 20k bank would be willing to watch the 8th trade running with the bank depleted to 7k?

fun graphic- post 467 made 5% in 5 months (12% per year non compounding) this is ok but risking your 20k bank for 12% return is too risky for me.

While writing this i did the spread sheet. Shows a bank of 20k is required to withstand 8 losses leaving a 35% bank intact. 5k and 10k banks bust at 7 and 8 loosing trades

Im properly gonna be hated for this but its fundamental to trading to know the risk before trading. Thats why we’re all here, to discuss and achieve success by brain storming ideas.
The only way i can see this working is to get the win ratio up. Or apply the same martingale strategy to a higher winning system?

Hey do u have any info on "surefirething"?

thnx

--- 帖子 #534 ---
jimnz,

I have zero information on it. I didn't realize it was a Pivot EA when I downloaded it. You might try googling it.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Jimnz, it depends on your settings my friend.

2500$ if you can bear some risk.

5000$ if you are more reasonable.

That is my conclusion on cable (G/U) for 2004.01-2010.08 .... realizing at least 1000$/year ... that is some return ... and no compounding ... thus removing every benefit at EOY and restarting fresh.

Now, this has been extracted from MT4 90% modeling quality backtest I performed. I would be more convinced once I run these on my 99% dukascopy set-up ... if only my backtesting computer didn't crash yesterday.

HTH.

PS: the point of the EA is actually to help tweaking Mer's parameters to your "trading risk personality"

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Johnny, this is the today's illustration of what I mean: Why would you initiate the Buy-Trigger considering it is exactly at today's resistance ... whereas it was well placed for the earlier sell-trigger ...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now, considering placing/moving/adjusting (whatever we call it) the box, on the provided illustration it is clear that box (normal one with the last indy) was definitly meant for a Sell at the breakOut .... The Box extent is almost the Resistance/Pivot Deviation ..... Slightly above the pivot to increase our chance for taking pips from a sell ... and eventually quite well placed for a rupture of the resistance ... but I would not have go there ..... way less risk with the support.

That said, I would have moved the Box up to the resistance level (few pips anyway), actually even a little above, so as to guarantee more profit in case of Support testing, or at least ranging round the pivot, and providing a clear statement for the Resistance Breakout.

This does not happen every day .... but today .... it was easy to make more pips ... and that's exactly the configuration I'm trying to code in the EA right now.

What do you think ?

Mer, This is also exactly how I defined my CT mechanism right now .. that is I have fewer CT that you, but I'm more convinced it will not go against me (although it does from time to time of course !)

Many thanks for the extraordinary work of mer and sq.

After visual backtesting the last 9 months on eur/usd i derived to an observation that celtic posted few posts back when the initial breakout reverses I tried the following...first I put my sl @ .50 of the box (red line) my new entries are not at the original  levels but at the  .236 levels of my box fibs  (blue lines) and my  new targets are  tp1 pips away from those lines so the first tp is very close to what celtic has suggested a few posts back.

With this reconfiguration after the failure of the initial break out has almost eliminated the need of martingaling because after the first loss the second loss ...if it happens is much smaller.

A million thanks to mer and sq for sharing this system

--- 帖子 #539 ---
0- "RTFM" (read the F@!$@ manual) first... it has most of the answers...

1- MagicNumber=0  means the EA will determine it for you, with different values for different pair/TF/"objPrefix" values.

You can use 0 if you run the EA on different pairs, all will have different magics so no confusion;

When using the EA on multiple charts of the SAME pair and same TF, you can either input a non-0 MagicNumber (easiest and safest i think), or input a different "objPrefix" string (which will produce a different magic).

2- the EA can run without the Indi loaded; it will compute on its own the box and levels; it can also draw them for you ("ShowBoxes" true);

3- 4- times are in 24h format (00:00 - 23:59)

Hi Johnny,

I'll admit that I did not fully grasp al your points when you're talking about pivots,although I do understand the point you are making about all th "lost" pips as it were in waiting till the buy/sell point by which time its is possible that the move is exhausted.

Am I correct in understanding as in the followng: Lets say you have an initial box, with therefore tp1, tp2 and a tp3. Lets say short tp3 is triggered. Price might now start moving long, therefore we now consider the tp3 as the buy extent point. This way, we have changed the pivot point, and have a far higher likelihood of taking profit going long, compared to waiting for price to reach the original static buy point.

I also think there is much merit in your suggestion to tp on a retrace to the tp point. So, by way of example, if going long and tp1 is crossed, rather than tp at that point, we tp only if price comes bck to hit tp1. If however it continues on to tp2, goes beyond and then retraces to hit tp2, we tp both tp1 and tp2, thereby considering improving our return.

Also agree with being averse to huge martingales when trading real accounts, this could begin to address that.

Neat ideas, I think.

Hi, Johnny,  completely different time. Only the e/j (although it would probably work with the g/j), max box size 75, limit set to true, the times of the box is 21:00 GMT to 02:00 GMT (this should equate to 5pm EST to 10pm EST), session end time 17:00 GMT (or 1pm EST). Session end time for this pair might work a little bit better cutting it off an hour earlier, have not had time to test that.

I settled on this box time partly because of the Asian session time and partly because after visually scanning the charts and starting some back tests, it looked like a good time period for breakouts. After the manual back testing back to Jan '09, it did work out pretty well, possibly better than the London times for this particular pair. Although i'm not positive of that, did not do the back test for the London time. I wanted something I could trade manually without getting up at 3am. The London time works better for the e/u and g/u, and the New York time also looks like it works well for several pairs, but I have not had time to back test. It takes many, many hours to do one pair (with one set of settings) manually for that long a time period.

I am hoping that with some of the upcoming EA revisions I will be able to reproduce similar results and can then test lots of different settings and times   Although it still may not come out exactly the same.... in my manual back testing, I traded it just like I actually would... I set one buy and one sell pending order at 10pm, then re-entered manually if applicable after 7 or 8am until 1pm. Adding iParamonWorkTime to the chart made it easy to see those times. This worked out a little bit better than taking every single trade during that period.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Valid points, Jimnz. The bank requirements are quite steep, OK in a demo, but real trading not many could afford it.

I have been pondering and testing how I can overcome those things to keep it realistic for me. I do not wish to be greedy, in fact a safe 20 pips per day would do for me. If I start with a 1000$ a/c at 1$ per pip, I'd be happy with an average return of 400$ per month ( which is probably more than most would achieve).

To accomplish this, I've been testing a box based on 0600 to 0629 london time. The box is normally therefore smaller in range. I use not 3 trades but just the one, to keep martingale values low in case of loss. I use a tp of 1.5, which also enables me to keep the martingale low, yet return decent profit.

The thinking behind this is that you start getting some volatility with Frankfurt and London open. If the box range is say 10 or 15 pips, you should hit tp pretty soon since the daily range of GU say is over 100 pips.

I am only interested in 1 win, at a pip box size of say 15, that would give me 22 pips profit. I've found that in my testing you can be finished before 11. Whatever price does after that, whether it ranges or whatever, I have already taken my profit and will wait for next days trade. Squalou has very kindly agreed to add a condition in the EA similar to the Max Loss Trades, which would be Max Profit Trades. We can then specify whether we are happy with just the one winning trade for the day or more than one.

If you do hit a loss, the box size being smaller means that your losses and hence drawdown is much smaller as well.

In reality, I would probably be trading more than one box. Another box I'm looking at is between 2300 and 2359 - same principle, Tokyo opens then and should provide the one winning trade pretty soon. Small box size = smaller losses and drawdowns, even if you have 3-4 consecutive losers.

So essentially, have more than 1 box ( currently putting EA on more than one chart), go for the 1 tp on just 1 single trade.

Actually, this resonates in principle with the points Johnny has made about shifting boxes on moving pivots, if I have understood his points well.

Will be glad to hear peoples views.

Thanks for sharing the EA.

Ive had it attached to some charts but it wont open any trades. It just keeps saying its failed in an alert box.

Any ideas please.

many thanks

Interesting idea Pardy,

However , when looking at charts with your settings there are still days when market jumps from entry to SL several times before hitting TP ( especially when box size is small ) . We need new version of EA with possibility of one trade and MaxWinTRades option to make more backtests.

Squalou's hard work is very appreciated.

Regards,

RL

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Squalou, please review the following EA behavior, that occured today: Sell-trigger occurred in the middle of the profit zone ? whereas everything was fine first.

Attached Image

The unexpected behavior is reproducible in backtest (I just did it). I don't think it's a matter of spread. I suspect the problem came from the fact that during the SAME candle, I closed profit for first 3 sell orders, then it directly re-open 3 sell-orders (no apparent reason) ? ... so the only unusual thing is that it happened within the same candle.

And yes, another great day .... 2 false signals (that I actually cleared with my set-up which I will present in the next post) and then 3 orders profits + another 3 orders profits ;-)

PM me if you need further info for checking what I believe is a bug.

Mer, I would appreciate you tell me what you think of the following.

Your LBO (london break-out) is excellent. As it is, I have a complete 2004 to 2010 profitable backtest starting with a fresh deposit of 2500$ every year .... and at least 30% / year. That is, no curve fitting, simply finding good parameters for handling different market conditions and understanding what's underneath a break-out strategy. This is a conservative setting for my trading feel. (I mixed this with gambling with half the house profits ... and .. well it's gambling some years I reached 500% profits, some years I crash, and some year I crash after making up to 300% my gamble .... I believe there is a clean line here.... I believe in this strategy and there are lots of ways to be happy with it) .. personal note: Gambling is not Trading.

Now to my point, we will bear the cost of false signals due to box-ranging .... you cannot avoid this, that is the core of any B-O anyways and, considering what I said earlier, that can be handle very well.

I dug into some of the most popular B-O strategies in FF, TSD, and some russian forums (thank you Chrome for auto translating websites), and I now use the following:

to trigger a signal XpMA and PSAR have to agree with the LBO signal. Add a little Support/Resistance as I personally think any system shall consider these. This results in the following set-up:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

That is today.

I got burn at the first sell trigger. I didn't take the second buy-signal because XpMA and PSAR didn't agree. I took the third sell-signal .... Well, the EA randomly open the 4th-sell signals .... I manually moved TP2 to the Support Line ... I do not believe in moving/altering TP1 (from my experience so far and the backtesting I did) .....

All this dramatically increases the profits for the day, while being coherent with your methodology, and market price/action behavior. That's perfect to my standards.

To all, this is my current set-up, and this is what I'm trying to code in the EA. I usually wouldn't share up to this point on a public forum but Mer and Squalou did so much that I felt I had to.

Let me know what you think about it Mer.

Squalou, like I did before, as soon as this is implemented in my Modded version, I will lend you the code.

Why did the first trades series close before TP1 ?

Did you  close them manually ?

The EA will look for opening opportunities when "today" trades are closed.

It opens a new series if the previous M15 bar closed inside the box (as per Mer rules), and price has breached the box edge.

That's your case, so it immediately opened new trades.

Note that I added a safety check in the EA to allow opening trades only if price is within the first half of the Entry<>TP1 zone, to prevent opening trades too far away from the normal Entry lines.

This is not in Mer's rules, but that was just my own common sense.

The reason is to prevent the EA from doing silly things you are starting the EA in the middle of the session, and price is has just rocketted off the Entry and TP zone.

Like during news release for instance....

Squalou,

First trade was closed at TP1, and order 2 and 3 were stopped after moving SL to BE+7 (in my case).

I have no clue why the other set of 3orders open ... that is actually what concerned me in the first place. I will re-start a backtest and provide the log file ..... well that's gonna have to wait until sunday night cause testing this with a 8-fixed spread will not really help.

First set of 3 sell orders behaved as expected ... .I di not know why the second set actually even open.

I don't know what settings you're using, but using the new adjustments, I never made it over a multiplier of 13 all week (including starting at 2 on Monday).

Dude, you should know me by now, I am all for someone who takes the basics and makes it their own (I feel like American Idol). And I'm sure sqaulou appreciates all your input and suggestions with the code, as do I.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Squalou, I believe the issue lies exactly in what you said, which I just got from the code:
Inserted Code if (iClose(NULL,PERIOD_M15,1) <= BuyEntry && Ask >= BuyEntry && Ask < (BuyEntry+BuyTP1)/2) {

This met exactly the conditions I went in today .... which is not desirable in these (maybe isolate) price-action settings.

Let me think about it and I'll come back to you with a new piece of code with some justifications. You'll pick what you want in the end ;-)

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Mer,

That's internet. You don't know no one out there.

Without looking for appreciation, I'm looking for a little bit of your experience with regards to what I proposed as a coherent slight add-on to your strategy, without parting with your core methodology (which I thought was how you wanted ppl to contribute).

If this is not how you want ppl to contribute (which means though, you also need to discuss any relevant add-on in the spirit of your methodology), I'll suck it up, and keep basically profiting of everything out here.

Really, no hard feelings here ... but I won't take the time to post if it doesn't help me go forward.

I am running the EA through the tester, all works well except it is not recognizing the MaxBoxSizeInPips.  When reviewing the results from the tester, it is still showing trades on days that the box is outside my max limit.  I have triple checked my inputs.

squalou,

Sorry I missed your reply until now. The problem with the box is shown on the attached chart. The box on the left is out of position and is positioned for an up trend which is totally wrong. I will let you analyze this for a short time and I will then post my solution. Thanks again for your reply.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #582 ---
johnny,

you sound like a "university professor" during a "practice session" ...

" I know you can do it... just twist your brains a bit more, you WILL get something out of it..."

Ok, so, what's wrong with that left box position in the chart you just posted ?

It sticks to the lowest-bar-which-comes-after-the-highest-bar, and that matches your suggestion in post #469, unless i misunderstood it.

The right box is also correct according to this rule, but you didn't seem to bother about that one...

Again, here is your quote from post #469:

I interpreted that sentence as:

- if the lowest bar in the box comes after the highest bar, then stick the bottom of the box to the lowest low;

- if the highest bar in the box comes after the lowest bar, then stick the top of the box to the highest high;

What am i missing ?

Another (hidden) rule probably...

How do you distinguish the 2 boxes in your pix then ?

They both stick to the lowest low, which is the one that came last.

However, i agree that the left box on your pix in post #515 is incorrectly positionned, but i still don't have an explanation for that other than "incomplete history data", or, "you have modified the Indicator code".

?

SQ

--- 帖子 #583 ---
squalou,

Hey wait a minute here. Just because Mer has taken a vacation doesn't mean you can pick on me, that's his job. Besides this is serious business so let's think about a solution to the problem. First and foremost quit sleeping in class and look at the last chart I posted again. Yes it has stuck to the last bar but it is still not correct as far as maximizing our pip gain.

This is how I meant the box to be placed:

- if the lowest bar in the time span left to right comes after the highest bar, then stick the bottom of the box to the lowest low;

- if the highest bar in the time span left to right comes after the lowest bar, then stick the top of the box to the highest high;

This is why some box placements are out of whack. I believe the code "Maxpips" is defining the box too soon and the code should only be looking at the highest high and the lowest low with no MaxPips screwing up the placement of the box. Once we find the extreme high or low then we place the box with the MaxPips restriction from the extreme point. But enough of that as we are still not placing the box in the correct position.

The last chart I posted placed the box in the correct position as I requested but if you look at the trend from the previous major pivot point we could have placed the box in a better position. My post was to get everybody thinking and some feed back. It was a surprise quiz and you failed it but I'll give you another chance with the book open so continue on reading.

Please understand I'm not the coder you are as this is my first attempt at looking at the MT4 code. It has been two years since I attempted coding and back then I had a son in college taking courses who advised me when I got stuck. He has since moved out of state and fallen in love which makes him totally unavailable. He is totally focused on other things. I've been recovering from surgery and am just limping along and sometimes in a pain killer haze.

As I stated in my original request before you changed the code was that the top and bottom box extents(excluding MaxPips adjustment), could be resistance or support lines and that the price movement will just as likely bounce off these lines as go through them. This is a the key to the placement of the box. Placement of the box where there is no S or R is just wasting pips.

Placement of the SL should be above the last point of resistance or below the last point of support. Understand that major points of resistance or support is what we are looking for as minor SRs will likely be breached with only slight hesitation or a small reversal by the PA.

With the clear understanding of the most desirable box placement and considering all factors such as the SRs and the SL where are the best places for the two boxes on the chart to be located?

Rule #1

The top or bottom of the box should be placed on a support or resistance line and a major point of SR is the most desirable.

Rule #2

The StopLoss should be placed above the point of resistance or below the point of support.

Let's look at the box on the left first. With the trend obviously on a sharp downtrend the placement of the box below or on the SMA-9 (Magenta) line is just plain crazy and is asking for a losing trade which is exactly what transpired as the PA moved up to hit the BUY LINE and then promptly reversed to continue the downward trend. Following the rules laid out above the only logical placement is the highest high with the BOTTOM of the box at the point of resistance. The top of the box providing the stoploss. As you can see we don't need 30 - 50 pips of stoploss and we don't have to wait 30-50 pips before a trade is made thus eliminating numerous losing trades in the future.

Now let's review the box on the right which is a classic hit of a very major reversal point at 1.2625. Anybody who can read a chart would have placed the S1 at 1.2625 way before the PA actually got there. The PA hit this point to the very pip and bounced like a rubber ball. The PA bouncing off of 1.2625 was not a chance occurrence but a very foreseeable point of reversal. Only new traders would have been caught with their pants down here. If any of you got caught it shows your lack of pre-trade planning and chart reading. Trust me here if I can do it so can you. It just ain't that hard to learn.

The placement of the box here is again quite logical as this is a major line of support. The TOP of the box should be on the 1.2625 line of support with the bottom of the box our stoploss. What is the chance our stoploss will get hit? Zilch!!! And that's a beautiful thing.

Now you're are wondering where do I put my buy and sell points right? It's quite simply the pivot point. If you place the point of the box at the pivot point and have the start of the breakout float to that point you're in the money one tic from the pivot. Now the pivot does not show as a pivot on a pivot indicator for at least one bar and some indicators three or four bars but there are other ways to see the point of price exhaustion. Even if it takes you a couple of bars to make the trade you're still way ahead of the game.

Attached is the revised chart. The reason the box is so small is that's the only way I can get it to work at this time. This also brings up the issue with the Take Profit lines being a factor of the box size. The box size should have no bearing on the profit lines except they should begin at the pivot point. The user should be able to set his profit lines wherever they so desire. I also would suggest more profit lines as five is somewhat limited.

Johnny

Squalou,

Please understand this is not to belittle you or Mer or any of either one of your ideas but only to make the system better with an exchange of knowledge and ideas.

On post number 498 Mer posted the results for 8-25-2010. Please compare that to the chart posted below. You will not find any losers with my proposed method nor will you ever unless the price totally reverses faster then a speeding bullet. This trading method is a function of the markets known reversal points and thus the actual placement of the box should be placed at these points regardless of the time. Please note the pivot occurred one and one-half hours before the London Open on the attached chart but this is where the box should be placed.

If the major reversal starts one hour before the London open or one hour after then that is where the pivot is located. Time is not the major factor here and is only an approximation of when an event is likely to happen. It is volume combined with market sentiment that moves the market in a particular direction.

We are attempting to capture the momentum of a major move to put a ton of pips into our trading accounts. With this goal in mind why place the box on a minor pivot if it is likely to only bring us pain and a loss of pips. Putting the box on a minor pivot and totally on the wrong side of the prevailing trend is only going to get the trade stopped out.

As I have stated before in a previous posts, if you concentrate on eliminating the losing trades and ignore the winners you will get to the promised land and reap the rewards. Without the need for the Martingale as you will soon realize.

To make the comparison easier to view I've included a copy of Mer's 8-25-2010 EURUSD chart below.

ohnnyBgood work as always. its easy to see the thinkers from the followers.

this logic is good, but how does one define the turning point or if the BOX moves with the PA how do we define the box?

also can u post ur template so i dont have to try to replicate. zigs, ma's, semophores??

thnx to all the contrubiters.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
jimnz,

Thanks but understand this is all discussion at this point. The boxes drawn on my chart were buys and take profit areas. As far as defining the box that's quite easy to see as I wrote in my post. The indicators as well as  Support and Resistance levels will show you when the PA is about to reverse.

Here are the template and indicators.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #587 ---
jimnz,

Here are the remainder of the indicators. These show the pivot points which I only used to show where they occurred and I am not implying to trade off these. They will not show up when you actually need to make the trade and they will repaint. That said you don't have to hit the nail on the head to make this a profitable trading method. If the pivot repaints and you're already in the trade then move the box. The important thing is to have the box on the line of support or resistance as the trade progresses.

Good Luck,

Johnny

Hi guys!

I have just one question. Can one use Squalou's original '3 tier strategy EA' on two USDJPY M15 charts at the same time without changing the Magic Number on one of them?

Thanks to mer for starting this thread.

Squalou, I really admire your coding skills and the work you did with this strategy. Keep it up guys!

--- 帖子 #591 ---
The automatic magic number (when MagicNumber input is 0) is generated based on pair+timeframe+"objPrefix";

Same pair+same timeframe means same magics, unless objPrefix input is different.

If you don't want to change the magic, then you need to change the "objPrefix".

SQ

vuser06,

That indicator is incomplete and even if it was complete this is Mer,s and Squalou's thread. They may find objection with me posting a different version. My post was for discussion only. You can download the V.3.2a version indicator. Maybe Squalou will see fit to post an optional indicator for those interested. It is not my call.

Cheers,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #593 ---
NOW you're talking !!!

I have now moved from "intrigued"  to "all ears open" :nerd:

Let me just summarize Mer's strategy to lay things down clearly for everyone.

The Breakout Box is based on the observation that market opening (London open for GU or EU) brings increased volatility, volume, and price action, compared to the calm few hours prior to the market opening.

The breakout strategy tries to take advantage of this increasing price action by hoping that price will break through the calm zone's high/low range, and price will fly away from it.

The box high/low are set to highest/lowest price action during the few hours prior to market open, which can be seen as "local" (weak/minor?) support (box low) and resistance (box high) levels.

We buy if the resistance is broken, sell if support is broken.

That's for the BO mode.

CT (CounterTrend) mode assumes that price will bounce on the support or resistance rather than breaking through them. We trade inside the box rather than outside.

The box is built using a fixed/arbitrary time range, supposed to give us enough pre-breakout price action to create our SR levels, and ending close enough to the breakout event itself.

Now back to your suggestions.

Your examples suggest that price will likely bounce on the SR levels, so you place your box outside the latest SR level, right next to it.

This will show where your stop is, which is fine.

However, it doesn't yet show where you would enter -- as price has already started to bounce on the SR level that forms the edge of the box, we are already too late to enter.

Or, as you suggested, we wait for a few (2 or 3) bars to confirm that price has bounced for sure, draw the box at that time, and enter a trade.

We are already away from the box edge, but we are still ahead compared to using Mer's box, on which we would be somewhere inside the box, waiting for price to break the other edge before finally entering (and too late, if i hear you well).

A clarification: you're talking about using the "pivot point".

By "pivot point", do you rather mean "swing(reversal) point" ?

To me, "pivot" is the half price between a high swing point and a low swing point ( daily pivot = (daily high + daily low) / 2 ).

The other question is: how do we determine that a swing point is "major" or not ?

You gave as an example on aug. 31 the "so obvious" 1.2625 major support level...

Don't get me wrong in my next few lines, i want this to be constructive.

Here it is.

Looking at the chart again, i can't see what's so obvious there...

To me, "major" SR levels are past unbroken/untested swing/reversal points, and/or 00 or 50 round numbers (RN).

1.2625 is the farthest that can be from a 00 and 50 RN...

Look at an H1 chart, zoom out, you'll see that the nearest unbroken/untested support level, before aug. 31, is 1.2609 on aug. 25, or 1.2588 on aug. 24.

So 1.2600 would clearly qualify as major support.

Where am i wrong ?

Can you explain how you ended up with 1.2625 being so major to your eyes ?

Here is my comments on the following two points,

I believe this is the worst place for the box. It will keep bouncing, thus potentially exponentially increasing false signals.

I believe the more you go in this direction, the further away from the LBO essence you'll get, and the closer to a traditional Sup/Res BreakOut strategy.

However, I do agree with the use of Support and Resistance ..... but to adjust whether the box size, or adjust the Take Profits.

Now Squalou,

Actually, my understanding on the system ... IF it is active after 2pm London Time (that is in between 7-9am EST ... yes you see me coming) ... then Mer's BreakOut is actually taking the pips out of a potential session breakout at the London Open AND doing same for the BigDog BreakOut (for which the box may not be optimal ... yes you see me coming too).

I leave it there. That explains everything I use while trading mer's strategy and I'm sure you understand everything I meant by this.

gd brainstorming,

id like to see the "anytime BO" stategy with the threads "box" methods combined more.

i see too many false BO's from just trading the calm of the asian to the vigor of the london. if we can define the trend reversals better, this could be a real winner.

i under usint the semofores to show extended trends, major SR for possible reversals, but we never know if they will stick. how about getting the EA to move the box auto.?

EG: once we get a "2 or 3" semafore, the box appears, top of box on top of price + 5 pips (sl) and bottom of box (entry) on a fixed pips, ATR, last low+5 ect.

Once the trend fails, takes our entry, start a TS?

This requires a trending market and a range forming at the "pivot" will kill the trade, so adx to filter ranges?

Sorry for directing off topic a bit and i know a complex EA may not be the direction to go , don’t want to sound like a cheap EA seller. Just throwing out thoughts

--- 帖子 #596 ---
this may be of interest. sort of applies

the indi shows S/R and draws and enter point on reversal.

the mid lines are fibs

i add semafores 2 & 3

again slightly off topic but still applies to CT trades

Hello squalou,

Thanks for your response.

[quote=squalou;3993721]NOW you're talking !!!

I have now moved from "intrigued"  to "all ears open" :nerd:

Let me just summarize Mer's strategy to lay things down clearly for everyone.

The Breakout Box is based on the observation that market opening (London open for GU or EU) brings increased volatility, volume, and price action, compared to the calm few hours prior to the market opening.

The breakout strategy tries to take advantage of this increasing price action by hoping that price will break through the calm zone's high/low range, and price will fly away from it.

The box high/low are set to highest/lowest price action during the few hours prior to market open, which can be seen as "local" (weak/minor?) support (box low) and resistance (box high) levels.

We buy if the resistance is broken, sell if support is broken.

That's for the BO mode.

Your statement above has the word "hoping" in it which I don't use when discussing Forex methods or systems. If I have to hope  a trade will happen I simply don't make the trade. Please understand  I'm not being adversarial with that statement. I have developed a system  that has proved to be 100% accurate which shows the probability of  success at any given time.

Without the determination of the high and low as minor or major then strong price action prior to the open is completely ignored and thus a great opportunity for profit is lost. Adversely if a weak support and resistance is found within the box extents then a counter trend move could actually be happening which could be very weak and result in a losing trade. This is what I've seen occurring.

CT (CounterTrend) mode assumes that price will bounce on the support or resistance rather than breaking through them. We trade inside the box rather than outside.

There you go you need to think and trade outside the box. Sorry I just could'nt resist it.

You are doing this with absolutely no knowledge if the high and low is anything but minor support and resistance which the PA will blow through these like they aren't even there.

The box is built using a fixed/arbitrary time range, supposed to give us enough pre-breakout price action to create our SR levels, and ending close enough to the breakout event itself.

The box is built around the assumption that time equals price movement which has some historical truth due to an increase in trading activity after the Open. The fallacy with this assumption is time also equals direction which it does not and hence the hope factor. The fact that the price usually reverses before or after the Open is well documented but time will always be a variable as well as strength of move. If a reversal has already taken place it is easy to see and if a move off a previous reversal point is about exhausted this too is easy to see meaning a reversal is going to happen shortly. So why dive off a cliff when you know the tide is going out and not in towards shore?

Now back to your suggestions.

Your examples suggest that price will likely bounce on the SR levels, so you place your box outside the latest SR level, right next to it.

This will show where your stop is, which is fine.

The top or bottom of the box is put on the SR with the Stop Loss below  support or above resistance if you are inclined to use a Stop Loss. I choose  not use them.

However, it doesn't yet show where you would enter -- as price has already started to bounce on the SR level that forms the edge of the box, we are already too late to enter.

I start trading three hours before the London Open. So get up a little earlier to catch the Major reversal point.

Or, as you suggested, we wait for a few (2 or 3) bars to confirm that price has bounced for sure, draw the box at that time, and enter a trade.

We are already away from the box edge, but we are still ahead compared to using Mer's box, on which we would be somewhere inside the box, waiting for price to break the other edge before finally entering (and too late, if i hear you well).

If you don't use anything to confirm the move then waiting to visually see the move is all you have.

If the PA starts up at the extreme bottom of Mer's box and the box is set at 50 pips due to the high and low this amount of pips has to be over come before a long trade is initiated. If the PA only moves beyond the buy point 45 pips and misses the 50 pip TP1 and then reverses we end up with 50 + 45 or 95 pips of PA movement and nothing to show for it plus the cost of the trade. My method gives you most of the 50 pips less only the confirmation of the trade + most of the 45 pips as my TP1 is at 30 pips and my TP2 is at 45 pips. The 20-50 pip loss of profit occurs on most of the first trades with Mer's method. If you don't trust your SRs why use them to place the box?

A clarification: you're talking about using the "pivot point".

By "pivot point", do you rather mean "swing(reversal) point" ?

To me, "pivot" is the half price between a high swing point and a low swing point ( daily pivot = (daily high + daily low) / 2 ).

The semantics is irrelevant. Call it the point at which the PA has  changed direction. The cardinal or crucial point. Whether this is a  change of the overall trend is yet to be known and maybe only a short  term reversal is about to take place which so often is showing up in  Mer's method. Having to use the Martingale system to attain  profitability sends a very strong signal to me that a change is needed.

The other question is: how do we determine that a swing point is "major" or not ?

You gave as an example on aug. 31 the "so obvious" 1.2625 major support level...

Don't get me wrong in my next few lines, i want this to be constructive.

Here it is.

Looking at the chart again, i can't see what's so obvious there...

To me, "major" SR levels are past unbroken/untested swing/reversal points, and/or 00 or 50 round numbers (RN).

1.2625 is the farthest that can be from a 00 and 50 RN...

Look at an H1 chart, zoom out, you'll see that the nearest unbroken/untested support level, before aug. 31, is 1.2609 on aug. 25, or 1.2588 on aug. 24.

So 1.2600 would clearly qualify as major support.

Where am i wrong ?

Can you explain how you ended up with 1.2625 being so major to your eyes ?

If you look at the Daily chart you will notice an eight day  period from early July to mid July the pair was hovering around the 50%  fib retracement level. This level again proved to be a strong support  level on August 4, 2010. The 50% level was 1.2625 and again on the 31st  of August it bounced off this level. The surprise would have been if the PA broke down and through. All this and no crystal ball who would have thunk it. Just kidding but it's not that difficult. You have to go back to June 7, 2010 to find the reversal point. Put the Fib indicator from this point to the high on August 6, 2010.

I use the stochastics and the bols to tell me the price has exhausted it's run and is about to reverse. The degree of angle is very important factor and a counter trend trade is not taken just because the PA has come back under the bols band. If a counter trend trade is taken then a likely take profit is the center of the bols but only on a retrace move to allow the PA to hit the opposite Bols Band. I have two Stochastics indicators and a Momentum indicator placed in one panel. One is for the high and the other is for the low. If both come together at the same time at a high (100) or a low(0) with Stochastic "D" and Mom confirming then its take profit time. A counter move may only retrace to the center bols as stated above but extremely rare is a loss.

The take profit lines are not based on the Fibs but the Fib retracement lines are on my chart. Buy or Sell stops can be placed as the PA continues its run to catch a reverse of direction. Once a reverse starts it is often very fast and furious. I still believe letting your winners run is the best way to increase your profits instead of the arbitrary set profit levels.

Thanks,

Johnny

Please read my previous as per putting the box at SR .... bad idea.

for the 100% accurate that shows probability of success .... if it shows anything else than 100%, then you have a bug  Come on Johnny, did you succeed in modeling human emotions .... if so you should talk to DARPA, I'm sure they'd be interested.

No seriously, I agree with the concept of SR ... but don't over do it.

I already tried multiple add-ons to Squalou's codes (and Mer's method in extent), and I may say that up to now, nothing passes a 2004 till now backtest except using the original method with appropriate parameters.

What would be nice Johnny is you provide daily chart of your trades with a box placed at SR without any StopLoss (come on again ... whether you put one, or you stick in front of your computer and be a human StopLoss .... I would accept you mentioning a dynamic StopLoss based on SR and Risk ratio). I wonder what would really happen.

I may add .... you told Squalou about "fallacies" regarding time and price action/direction (I think you went strong on him so I allow myself for the next comment) ..... but my friend .... what is Support and Resistance to you (don't tell anyone, I think a reversal is a price action direction for a given time period) ? Ooops .

xmph,

THE BOX.

Some want a little box and some want it big.

Some can't decide as they're new to this gig.

Some want to trade the box as prescribed.

Others are questioning and need to be bribed.

Some want to trade with the box in the middle.

With others it seems like an insolvable riddle.

I'd like the box out of the way.

So think about it what do ya say.

Convincing you all of the box position,

is becoming quite a proposition.

But until that time of agreement has come and past,

we'll continue this discussion until the last.

Please review the attached chart. What can be better then this? Do you see any losses? Any reversals back to the box? Any stoploss hits? Please show me a better way if you have one. BTW the box doesn't bounce.

If the placement of the box is the top of the box on a major low reversal point why would you believe the price will go anywhere near it. Even if the price does retrace to this point, if the price doesn't touch the stoploss above this level it will never take out the trade. The whole point of this placement is to take the box out of the picture and to create a stop loss for the initial trade. Once the first trade has completed the box has no further use and the Take Profit Levels take over as the points of buy and sell.

How can you say this? You are confusing time, the London Open, with good trading methods. Placement of the box is critical to get a strong price movement and correct direction of the initial trade. With the first trade being directionally challenged we are then looking to recoup the losses and enter into high risks trades with the Martingale. This method is a momentum system attempting to jump on the increased movement of the PA due to volume. If we can only get the program going in the right direction it can't lose with or without the Martingale system.

My initial suggestion of moving the box has helped where the price was at a major reversal point. This suggestion moves the box out of harms way so to speak and also eliminates the need to wait to the top or bottom of the box to place a trade. The waiting for the price to move to the top or bottom of the box is just lost profit opportunity.

The Take Profit positions are being adjusted on every new London Open which is being based on prior high and low over a user defined time period. What is the logic behind this? Please tell me as the answer is eluding me.

If the logic for determining the size of the Box was valid then it would be valid on the NY Open and the Asian Open. The fact is the Frankfort Open to the Close has little or no validity to determining the size of the box on the London Open no more then then phase of the moon and if it does I'd like to here the explanation.

I'm not trying to be smart here but the size of the box, TP levels, the placement of the box and how the initial trade is made is questionable in my mind and others I'm sure. This is the whole reason why we are discussing it so improvements can be made as new ideas are presented.

Yes we can as Mer has suggested, change the box size to whatever and place the box wherever but the problem is still how the box is placed. I can only get the box where I want it by changing the code which is not an option for everybody. I believe a simple trend formula may also help with the box placement as even as it is now a one bar difference in start or end location and the box could go from above to below the trend. Now this alone would not change the way of the PA and it has so far to go anyway to become a trade the placement of the box isn't that big a deal.

Happy trading,

Johnny

Hello xmph,

xmph;3994549]Please read my previous as per putting the box at SR .... bad idea.

I know it was a bad idea for you to say that. I forgive.

Please I'm all eyes and ears please show me a better solution.

for the 100% accurate that shows probability of success .... if it shows anything else than 100%, then you have a bug. Come on Johnny, did you succeed in modeling human emotions .... if so you should talk to DARPA, I'm sure they'd be interested.

The method is 100% accurate how can you beat that? It wasn't even all my idea as my son helped. I knew that college would make that boy smart.

No bugs and I feel fine but thanks for asking. Show me a losing trade with my revised box method. Please show me as the elimination of losing trades in a particular method is the only way to improve the end result. Finding these code or method errors is like finding little diamonds. I welcome all with open arms who posts any and all logic errors or holes in my method. I absolutely take nothing personally so go ahead unless you get personal then that's a horse of a different color.

No seriously, I agree with the concept of SR ... but don't over do it.

How can you over do the use of the SRs? That's like saying making too much money is a bad thing.

I already tried multiple add-ons to Squalou's codes (and Mer's method in extent), and I may say that up to now, nothing passes a 2004 till now backtest except using the original method with appropriate parameters.

Then the only logical solution is to shoot the coder. Sorry it's only business.

What would be nice Johnny is you provide daily chart of your trades with a box placed at SR without any StopLoss (come on again ... whether you put one, or you stick in front of your computer and be a human StopLoss .... I would accept you mentioning a dynamic StopLoss based on SR and Risk ratio). I wonder what would really happen.

I will not be prey for the stoploss hunters. I will not be prey for the stoploss hunters. I will not be prey for the stoploss hunters. I'm not going to play your game and become a Forex trainer here. I don't even trade this chart as it is not ready to trade as advertised as far as I'm concerned much less trading the EA. Nothing personal just my opinion. Why give up a tried and true method for a new one.

The discussion is about the box placement and alternate ways to trade the box and not how I trade. Let's keep the discussion relevant shall we.

I may add .... you told Squalou about "fallacies" regarding time and price action/direction (I think you went strong on him so I allow myself for the next comment) ..... but my friend .... what is Support and Resistance to you (don't tell anyone, I think a reversal is a price action direction for a given time period) ? Ooops

Something was lost in the translation. I don't understand Chinese but that's alright.

Aren't you the one who said the backtest only had a 1.++ something profit factor? And you're telling me this is the best you can do even with changing the code? If you didn't reach a PF factor of 10 on the revised code then you haven't even begun to reach coder stardom. Tell me you're just kidding. And you're calling me crazy?

All good fun my friend but I really must get on with other things. Thanks for the chat.

Here's hoping your trade makes it out of the box you put it in,

Johnny

PS: I let mine out of the box to run to the profit lines. It's funny just how much faster the profits rise without that darn box slowing them down. It's like a race horse running a race with a 300 pound jockey. Just get a little jockey and the horse will run faster. In this case get a tiny box and don't put the price inside it.

Cheers

Hello juzgood1978,

It really has a very simple concept but it isn't a program thing. I will explain it in simple easy to understand language.

I have a little miniature Dashund by the name of Jack who loves to take a walk through the woods in the nearby public park. As I walk on the path with Jack on a long rubber cord leash he looks for signs of the rabbit he knows is hiding somewhere in the bushes. He will absolutely stretch his leash to the limit when he smells something and then he will move to the opposite side of the path and do exactly the same thing. He doesn't always do this and only when his nose tells him the rabbit has been there. I always know when he's going to stretch his leash as his tail starts wagging after a long inhale and abrupt exhale through his nostrils of obvious fresh rabbit scent. By now you probably think I'm crazy but I assure you I'm quite sane.

You see the market does exactly the same thing as Jack. Sometimes during the 24 hour period of a single day the market smells something either good or bad. When this happens the price on a chart goes beyond the normal highs and lows and is very noticeable on a chart. The market again reacts just like Jack and crosses the line of equilibrium and goes in the opposite direction for just about the same distance. This happens on average of over five times a day. So when trading a market open or for that matter anytime of day I watch for signs the market has stretched the leash so to speak. If it has gone up I wait for the top and short the market knowing it's heading back down to the line of equilibrium and beyond. I have found this to be 100% accurate and is easily seen on any chart. There are many indicators that will highlight this such as the Bollinger Bands. This occurred four times on 9/1/10 and eight times on 8/31/10.

Happy trading,

Johnny

I coded a small change to the Indicator that will allow us to explore a first approach to JohnnyBSmart's inputs;

i.e.: consider the latest extreme (reversal) within the box as a S/R level, and

stick the box OUTSIDE using the latest extreme/reversal move as the box edge.

This is somewhat similar to using the CT mode of the strategy, where the box edges are used as reversal levels.

If the reversal point was a "major" reversal, then price will fly away from the box towards the TP zone.

We yet have to determine if the reversal will persist (hitting more TP levels), or if it was only a minor retracement (and PA will run back to us)...

Note that with this option, the rule for the FIRST entry must be modified;

price has already bounced off the box as per its definition, so we should enter immediately when the box forms, unless perhaps if price is already too far away from the box, and has already pierced TP1 or even beyond.

This will make us enter beyond the box edge, and reduce our TP zone, but this is the price to pay to get in the move earlier.

Remember that with this mode, we are most likely entering ahead of the "regular" box entry point.

- I added "StickBoxOusideSRlevels" input; set to true to enable this mode of drawing;

Let's see how our playground looks like with this new input;

I have attached the modified Indicator, and a template to load it with some settings that doesn't look too bad on EU.

The main settings are:

box time: 06:00-08:59

MaxBoxSizeInPips = 20

TP1 = 15 pips

TP3 = 50 pips

TP5 = 100 pips
And of course:
StickBoxOusideSRlevels = true

This is all still very experimental.

The box is still drawn at a fixed time range.

The next step would be to find a way to form the box at a better time.
Adding a ZigZag indi to determine the "better" swing point is a possibility.

This is what Johnny does with the "3 ZZ semaphore" indicator, which draws 3 different ZigZags with numbered+colored "spots" rather than a zigzag line, but it's basically the same.

We could have a "floating box time range", for instance a 6 hours range starting at 03:00(gmt+2), during which we would monitor our "box locking signal" indicator to wait for the "lock" signal.

When the "lock signal" comes, we draw the box at that time, which may happen before or after the regular 09:00 fixed box "endTime",

and enter a trade immediately;

Now we need to find the best "box locking signal" indicator.

ZigZag can be a good candidate;

ZigZag repaints of course, as it follows the highest/lowest price points;

So we need to wait for ZZ to survive for let's say 3 M15 candles.

At that point, we have our "lock signal" and we enter the game.

Let's see what this path can give...

Below are two snapshots of 3days action on EU from aug 25-27, with the same settings EXCEPT the StickBoxOusideSRlevels value:

---- 1 -----

StickBoxOusideSRlevels=FALSE:

(this would be the "regular" box mode)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

---- 2 -----

StickBoxOusideSRlevels=TRUE:

(this is our new "experimental" box mode)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It seems quite obvious that the "experimental" mode gives better results: we get much less caught into the Stop zone.

Now, this is a "chosen" example... it doesn't mean that this is going to be that cristal clear every day...

This looks encouraging, doesn't it ?

Dear all,

I took out the childish spirit and provide constructive information. I believe this answer is worth reading. I will not further comment on the 5pips 1Hour30min box placed at S/R levels without StopLoss suggested by Johnny after this.

Check the following - year 2005-2006 .... you're lucky I actually work on this yesterday so I can quickly wrap up some screenshots ... and I think it's good for Squalou not to go through what I've been as well

So I was backtesting 2005-2006 as it is an interesting year for testing Box placement with respect to Res/Sup ... but I guess you know that, you are smart enough to backtest a little more than few days back right.

... let that one run again ... you're a rich man in 3yrs, after retracement !

Here, green lines are support, red resistance and blue pivot. Depending on price action, I move move at +/- 4-5 pips to red or green, and it may be at a first or second level of S/R depending where price-action is occurring.

Now of course, there comes into play the time-window for the breakout, the active trading time-window, and size of box. These are parameters of the current strategy suggested by Mer and the very reason of the thread. Take these out, and this is no more the original strategy (as it would mean you don't believe in the strategy in the first place) so start a new thread.

Indeed, this is a London BreakOut Thread with a starting point defined by Mer. This is not a 5pips breakout strategy, no StopLoss, wishing it will retrace in the right direction ! Just to make sure there is no chinese mistranslation here: your box is 5pips, on a 15Min chart, does not include ANY Ask/Bid price, on a EUR/USD pair that is known (maybe I'm wrong) to have more than a 5pips daily volatility, and well, I assume your GMT correction is fine as I don't know your broker but it is definitly not covering our time constraints for London Open (it doesn't fit in your 1Hour30min box). So what's wrong (and here I assume this box would make any sense) is that it's not a London BreakOut (actually it's not even a breakout), it's (again assuming) a S/R strategy which is not the current thread discussion.

From a personal perspective, WTF do you get out of a 5pips box! No meaningful information here ... specifically for a smart statistician like you ... check your p-value I'm sure it's about 50 !

I suggested the following (it is self-explanatory if you understand S/R levels why putting the box in such places will extract the most pips while keeping the spirit of Mer's Break-Out). You don't like, fine, but don't keep on pushing for diverging from the current strategy or riddling about a 5pips-No StopLoss strategy in a thread that actually is a profitable strategy (for my standard ... 2004 till now profitable system).

My last words, No I do not develop system with a yearly 10times ratio that I would trade live. Every system I developed has to pass a 2004 till now period, with a starting deposit of 2500$. My goal is to double every year, and to date I manage to reach a minimum of 60% yearly which is not too bad. I'm not up to your backtesting standards ! I live in the real life where being a millionaire is only possible if you know how and when to loose.

Johnny, wanna keep along these lines, PM me ... no need to further pollute the thread.

PS: do you know why I didn't appreciate some physics teachers (and classes) in college .... they try to explain the world saying Earth is round, and that its weight is in the center just because that way, they know how to handle the math .... well, I had more fun spending one week re-demonstrating gravity laws in quantum physics courses some years later.

To me this is a new strategy: different times, different box .... and it does not even encompass price action.

I'm not saying this is wrong, I'm saying you should start a new thread for this. I would follow BTW, but we have to keep this thread dedicated to a LBO, as it was started by Mer.

xmph,

You need to read my posts twice before posting. I do not use a stoploss is very true and it is my choice but I do use BUY AND SELL STOPS, TAKE PROFIT LINES, FIBS, BOLLINGER BANDS AND PRICE CHANNELS which accomplish the same thing which is to minimize loss.

As far as this thread is concerned I believe Mer started it to share his ideas and to get input from others to better the system and thus attain a higher level of profitability. WE ARE DOING JUST THAT SO WHAT'S YOUR COMPLAINT AND WHY ARE YOU RANTING. Every trader I know wants to eliminate losses, minimize risk and just plain make more money. What is your goal???

What the heck does it matter if things have to be changed to attain our goal. So we move the box and adjust the TP levels and now instead of the box at the London Open it's now 30 minutes sooner. Get a grip on reality. You are putting all your efforts into proving my ideas wrong instead of seeing the obvious advantage of having the initial trade a win everytime.

Squalou changed the code to get closer to my ideas and although not spot on it is indeed getting closer. The positive results are proof or are you just not looking and are oblivious to change. Please open your eyes and your mind and you will see the advantages.

We seem to be moving one step forward and two steps back every time you post. Your last post in my mind was totally meaningless and quite frankly without any merit. If you are going to post and rant about my ideas then at least do me the courtesy and read my posts. This would be a step in the right direction to a better understanding.

The reason for the 5 pip box was explained but again you failed to read. This was the only box that would move to the correct position due to the underlying code in the program and also have the TP levels where I wanted them. I would suggest a bigger box but could not use one and show my ideas. Again only for discussion.

You seem to want to fight and take this to a higher level when I am only looking for a discussion of new ideas. Yelling and ranting as you are doing never win an argument and only shows your inability to discuss things in a civilized way.

Nobody has yet said you cannot keep your old system of producing losing trades so get a grip on yourself. You can keep losing all you want and nobody is going to stop you. If you are happy and believe that a 1.28 PF factor is the highest attainable level, then use it but why are trying so hard to convince others? Other threads on FF have back test 10 times better then 1.28 and I don't see you posting and ranting on those threads that they are nuts and this is an unattainable level. Go over to Steve Hopwood's thread or Nanningbob's thread and start your rants and see what happens.

If you're trying to wage a war of words please do everybody a favor and come prepared and fully understand the method I am proposing . Nobody likes your "WTF's" and attacks on some preconceived method that only exists in your mind. Try posting with respect to others and at least read before you start an attack. Better yet posts your new ideas if you have any.

Defend Mer's existing method like it's some kind of Holy Grail or religion is just plain childish. Mer himself liked the last code revision and said so himself. If he is open to change of his system then why are you so steadfast against it and attack new ideas like they are blasphemy without ever fully reading and understanding.

If you have a question I will do my best to answer it and I will forget your last post.

MAY THE NEW IDEAS BY ALL CONTINUE AND BE MANY,

Johnny

I'm done.

Yes, I did see how many indicators you have on your chart. Why don't you use your 100% accurate indi instead.

As per coming prepared, I'm sorry to post charts, examples and backtest days and times where your solution failed to work with respect to the current spirit of Mer's strategy. Like I said, I worked on it, I previously mention this was a bad idea from my experience, what I did last was just visually explaining why.

What you propose is a support/resistance breakout. That should be in a new thread that I would follow BTW.

Yes, I do value Mer's strategy. It nicely evolves from V1 to V2 ... and it's an evolution of the same strategy that previously I wouldn't trade, and that I'm now trading because it's profitable. It is not by introducing another strategy that you will help developing this one.

Enjoy your new strategy. I will not mention again that it's a different one and I will not argue that if you backtest it for more than a year it does not work like lots of strategies in FF. It doesn't mean this is not good, that means you would not sleep too well at night if you really had your money there ! I don't sleep enough, that's a given, but at least my EAs run and I do sleep well.

Please Johnny, open a PAMM account on ALPARI with your 100% accurate strategy and PM the name, it would be a pleasure to invest in it.

Hi,

Surely you know the opposition: Never touch a running system.

I´m a beginner but the "original" system works fine to me. okay, there are normal days, bad days and GOOD days.

I learned the most important thing .... Patience

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I've been following this thread for a while now. Personally, I think that some new ideas that people have contributed are very worthwhile, and I agree with the many very sensible and perfectly reasonable suggestions and comments from Johnny.

I really wouldn't get too hung up on a fixed time box just for the sake of that is how it started. How it started also includes a CT strategy which is not therefore only a breakout strategy.

I am keen to work on Johnny's suggestions since I think that the results would be far less drawdowns and martingales, some of which are currently so steep that it would make the strategy practically very difficult to trade for most ( regardless of all the backtests which might come out as ultimately positive)

What me must not lose sight of is the fact that it is more important to implement ideas that give us a safer more profitable strategy, even if in doing so it looks a little or even a lot different to how it started out.

Whether this discussion is carried on within this thread or in a different one, I have no firm views on it. Sq has already done some great work, both on the indi and EA. Mer I am sure would not mind continuing with the discussion and improvements here, he has asked for ideas anyway. Maybe the stage at which to think of a different thread would be when there is no box being drawn at all, lol.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hello squalou,

I was very excited to see your post and charts. I can't thank you enough and I was about to discuss further ideas when I noticed this post. In my mind this just took you from hero to zero. Why are you slamming the door on new ideas? Why would you even consider listening to the rantings of this guy. You are obviously way more intelligent then that and need to consider the ignore button.

I have a miniature Daschund who attacks anybody and everybody that comes through my front door before determining whether it's friend or foe. I have never been able to break this otherwise great dog from that very bad habit. I find people who also fit into this mold and changing them is just as difficult if not impossible.

Mer isn't a stupid person I'm sure and anybody suggesting he'd say no to a positive change has their head in the sand. Anything that improves his system and puts more money into his pocket has got to make him very happy.

I have no interest in claiming this system and am only posting ideas for mutual benefit. It is and always will be Mer's and your system and the original guy that coded the first boxopen version on another site. What could possibly be wrong with two versions for a running comparison? I have been on threads where this actually happened and it was a blast seeing which version would prevail as the winner. The end result was a system with the best of the best ideas from both which could very well occur here.

Stopping new ideas at this point in the thread is like stopping the fireman from putting out the fire that is engulfing your house and you didn't pay your insurance premium.

Don't let others determine your destiny and set your own goals. You are the one who has to live with your decisions. Anything can be looked upon from a negative view. Some will say the rays of the sun are blinding and look for dark while others will welcome the light and abandon the dark. It is only an individuals shear determination to achieve greatness and his or her's ability to silence the naysayers that will make that person great and see him or her to the fulfillment of their goals.

It comes down to the choice is yours and only yours to make. You can choose the dark and things will remain the same or choose the light and see what enlightenment comes your way.

Whatever your decision I wish you well and thank you again for the revised indicator and template.

May the sun shine brightly upon you,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I will follow you in a different thread Johnny. You seem to think I'm against your method where I'm saying what you propose does not fit nor work with the current strategy. No-one is slamming door. Beside saying it does not work for the current strategy, I never stop saying you should start a thread of your own and I'll join and follow it. Do you want me to start one for your strategy ?

Johnny, don't let our discussions slide on squalou's work and commitment.

I don't know why it's so hard to understand. Maybe you will appreciate re-reading Mer's word from the first post. My understanding is one can build up on the current strategy to improve it ... not change it's core process.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
xmph,

You still post with an air of arrogance. The one thing I've learned in life is to have an open mind and be open for suggestions. What I first believed as impossible is now possible and it just gets down to our own perception of reality. One's reality only changes with education and experience. It's like common sense which my Father-In-Law always said is the least common of all senses and he was quite correct.

You only have common sense through learning from others or making a mistake. Like a child putting their hand into a gas burner on a stove. Even though the Mother has told the child not to do this and explained what would happen the child still does it to find out for itself. Only then does this child have the common sense not to do it again.

Unfortunately some never get the message and go through life making the same mistakes over and over again. I find that it is these types of individuals who are the loudest in our society and the ones marching in protest of some obscure something or other. They always profess their superior common sense yet education has always eluded them.

I never suggested changing this method to a SR breakout system and only explained how I would trade it. Because I take profit at price exhaustion as well as TP levels and trade with the knowledge I've accumulated you say I'm something bad.

You also must believe that the London Open or so called breakout is something different then just the price bouncing from support to resistance. What is this breakout and a breakout of what exactly. It certainly isn't a breakout of some arbitrarily defined box. It is simply the market's reaction of the fundamental factors that drive the market and is usually overdone in direction with the influx of above average volume.

This just doesn't happen at the turn of a clock dial to 3:00 EST. If the Asian market didn't finish the move to support for example a completion of this move will take place before any move by the fundamental factors takes place and the subsequent move to resistance.

You have consistently shown your inability to grasp new ideas along with reading and understanding the written word. You pass yourself off as a learned individual but your posts suggest otherwise. Your lack of writing skills is for all to see. You proved nothing with your back testing and charts except for your complete misunderstanding of the ideas I have suggested. If you fail in understanding the ideas suggested and with your obvious lack of writing skills who may I ask in their right mind would believe your ability to write code is any better?

You keep posting "I'm done" but then I see another post. Please keep your promises. We are done listening to your rhetoric.

Johnny

Hiya Dude, thanks for the EA. I'm trying to test it but get an "order send - failed - invalid stops" alert. I tried changing the SL to a negative number, but that didn't help. Pray tell, what am I doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #618 ---
wow... this is turning into fight!

Johnny, Mer will certainly appreciate ideas towards improving the strategy.

However, as xmph pointed out, Mer has put a clear warning in post #1 about posting new ideas, and keep the strategy the way he has described it originally.

My point about letting it "go too far" is because we are now somehow the mice dancing in the house while the cat is not home...

Even if the mice actually think they are doing a great job and not fooling around, they don't know if the cat will like it when he's back.

I appreciate the new inputs because they are going into the right direction as per my standards.

If it would be my thread, I would be happy to keep it going this way.

But this is Mer's thread, not mine.

That was my point about the heavy housekeeping that Mer will have to do when he's back.

Perhaps he will just bless us to have gone that far and done so well!

So let’s calm down everyone and come back to our main topic: develop the strategy.

A development process can be divided into 2 major phases:

- creation : that's done i guess...

- improvement: that's what we are trying to do now;
Improvement itself is a converging process, consisting in

- testing the current system; this is what Mer is doing by posting the results every day;

- changing the system to try to achieve better results;

- go back to testing step until the results are good enough.

Finding the best settings for the original strategy is the first logical approach, and results posted by Mer and backtesting performed by others are doing fine for that purpose.

But there is also another path, consisting in finding useful variations to the original design.

And that is what Johnny is doing.

I think both have their place in this thread.

We are still talking about a box breakout strategy at this point:

we have a box, we have TPs and SL, all drawn by the same simple Indicator, even if it is modified.

The only difference with Mer's original strategy is that we are trying to find a better place to plot the box.
So, I don’t think time has come to fork a partner thread at that point.

Mer has already changed the box "default" time and price range settings several times in this thread, and from the V1 thread.

And he might just continue to do so "manually" as market conditions change.

What’s wrong in trying to automate that?

All the changes I made to the indicator and the EA are optional, and you can still use the original settings as the defaults.

We are currently "debugging" the system, and we need tools to do so.

We already have a very basic tool to draw our box and levels: manual inputs for the box time and price ranges.

These inputs can be seen as an Indicator that will signal when and where to draw the box and the levels.

All we want to do here is improve this basic tool, in order to plot the box and the TP/SL levels at their best places.

We will need other tools to move forward: additional indicators.

They are necessary at this stage of the development process.

Once the convergence stage is stable, we can simply remove all “debug” indicators from the chart and only keep the resulting box & levels, using the indicators internally without plotting them.

So, let’s continue with the discussions Johnny and I had started, will you?

SQ

--- 帖子 #619 ---
The box size is our SL.

I put 20 pips because i think that if the box is plotted at a "good" place, then we shouldn't need a bigger SL.

You can make it bigger to allow the trade to breathe more, but bigger SL also means bigger losses when it's hit.

Of course, smaller SL means that SL can be hit quicker.

SL size (box size) is also part of the optimization process.

SQ

The attached charts is a comparison what is happening now with the standard method on the second chart and the optional method on the first chart. This is for those who have not reviewed the difference between two methods. The price exhausted it's downward momentum before the start of the London Open and that is the reason for the earlier start.

Many times this doesn't happen until sometime after the Open which now puts you in a position of waiting or jumping in and taking a risk that the direction doesn't suddenly turn on you which is very likely.

On chart the first chart, the optional method you will notice eight(8) take profit levels TP0, TP6 AND TP7 are added.

Notice the top of the box is a take profit level and not a buy line. The buy is at the top of the box but is located within the box extents. The method of confirmation is optional. The solid dark blue line is the Gann Hi-Low and as the price crosses this line then buy. Also below is the Stochastics and Momentum which also can show direction change and price exhaustion.

I suggest using buy and sell stops to protect profit as the PA moves up or down in your favor. The positioning of these is up to you.

I personally am more likely to take profit off the Bols-9 with confirmation with the indicators then with the TP lines. This is because I can pinpoint the PA exhaustion and thus take more profit.

The chart is now showing turning down of the Bols and price consolidation at the TP0 line. The price will likely only go as high as the bols centerline and I will take profit there or on any retrace down. Confirmation of direction is needed before entering the next trade.

Our pip count at this point is + 80 x 3 = 240 using this threads initial three contracts at entry. A risk reward system would have upped the number of contracts count every 30 pips and thus the pip count would now be at least an additional 40 x 3 = 120 for a total count of 360 pips.

The second chart shows the buys and sell shorts in black rectangles. The red is the PA hitting a stop loss. There are no take profit hits at this time.

The pip count is 25 x 3 = -75 pips.

This is happening way to often with the standard method and why I'm asking for a revision to the standard or the use of an alternate method. The use of indicators is the users own choice. Using the TP levels and a stoploss would still make more pips with the alternate method.

The trades after this point are probably very similar except for the optional methods eight profit levels and the Martingale vs the Risk/Reward impact on the trades. The method I use always maintains risk no higher then the initial trade. Three contracts or thirty contracts the amount of risk never gets any higher. At some point I will take the initial risk amount off the table and from that point it becomes a zero risk trading session. You either break-even or make profit.

Again this is still at a discussion point on this thread. Some have already voiced their preference. This post is only for understanding the differences in the trading the two methods. The ultimate decision is not mine to make. Personally I'd like to see both running at the same time for a while.

Cheers,

Johnny

Hi SQ, cannot follow the ideas or the arguments of this thread but love the indi (don't know about the EA).

Wouldn't normally post but as you say "While the cats away..."

My 'time' is 0600-0630 but the range is often too smakk and I am stopped out both sides, big losses. I wanted to have a 25 pip SL. You have just provided it! Many thanks.

Nobody needs to reply to this and Mer should just ignore it.

To JBS and XMPH, please stop your arguments here, I cannot keep up with them, please start your new thread, I am sure that it will be a good development. Using Mer as a springboard may be just the thing for a successful system.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Squalou,

Thanks for explaining so eloquently. I know what mer posted but he has already accepted the last revision and acknowledged the advantages.

I have given some thought to the problem of the box and to how it can be placed in the correct position. On the Stochastics indicator within the code is the line itself as you already know. I believe by setting the line as a Global Variable of the Client Terminal we can then determine the direction of this line by the code itself giving us a very good trend direction. Then it is just simply putting the box below the PA on an uptrend and above the PA on a downtrend.

The most important trade is the initial trade and the problem with using the  15 minute chart is the many ups and downs. Even the M15 trend from the last reversal point is not always what you get for direction at the London Open. Often this is a short counter trend before the trade with the trend shortly after the Open which is the true breakout of the PA with heavy volume. In any event the stochastics will show the direction at any particular space in time.

The ZigZag is a good indicator but you may want to look at the NonLag ZigZag which I posted earlier. It still repaints but usually an acceptable pivot has already been established before the open or just after.

I will continue looking for solutions.

Have a great day,

Johnny

Just a note that I have been following this thread from the beginning and see the point of JohnnyB's words. I am using the EA live and am very pleased with the results. Thanks and kudo to Squalou for the coding, Mer for the concept and Johnny for his S/R points.

Of the VERY FEW losses I have had. They have occured whenever the EA opens a position near a support or resistance line. The strongest gains seem to occur when the position is opened away or opposite from these lines.

Since I do not have the bank to run a martingale YET. I am running the EA during different times on 3 pairs. Single trades only. I.E. MaxTradesAllowedPerSession=TRUE. In backtesting I have gotten a 80%+ winning rate on these three pairs and the profit to boot. With each pair doubling or tripling the account within a year. But i fear my settings may be too far away from the intent of this thread to post here. I would be happy to share those times and settings with anyone wanting to PM me or if a new thread is opened as I don't want take this thread away from the prescribed method. But if anyone does not have the money to run a marty. This is still a winning EA.

So in summary, optimize the times per pair, Don't go short near a support line, don't go long near a resistance line. I think it's awesome. Great work ALL.

ibthescottyb,

You're welcome but this has just begun to be great and with luck and determination it will be another "Black Box". High 90's percent wins is attainable.

Go ahead and posts your results and settings. As squalou has said the cat's away and we mice are raiding the cupboards, having wrestling matches and getting into all sorts of trouble. I feel like one of the Gremlins in the old ladies house rigging the automatic stair climber for Granny's send off out the upstairs window. So what's a couple of more posts? Mer is only going to have just one heart attack. We might as well make it a big one. We can always blame xmph.

Go ahead take your best shot.

Hi ibthescottyb,

hi

I'm glad you are doing well with it, but be careful with live trading the EA.

It is ok trading only 1 trade at a time, but i have not yet released the fix for the Trades2&3 not moving to BE after TP1 hit.

You are welcome to post your settings and results here, even if it's not the regular "London breakout" time range.

It will give us another exploration opportunity, and another reason for believing that this strategy IS profitable!

Real (live) results ARE valuable.

Thanks for your contribution.

Phreddy,

You've got it all wrong. Weez all here to save Mer from his inevitable blown account on a run away Martingale System. Xmph and I were just creating a diversion away from our main objective. If we started are own thread we'd have to kidnap squalou to do the coding. We figure if we get the win/loss ratio in the stratosphere he'll never have to go to the Mart.

Here's hoping Mer has a sense of humor.

trades 2 and 3 do move to BE after TP1 is hit "IF" the PA allows it. I say that because we all know that MT4 works on a tick by tick basis. Also, It only can send one signal at a time.

Let's say we are in a long position. The PA moves up and TP1 is hit. That order is at the server already so it gets fulfilled. However, let's say the next tick after TP1 is hit, the PA moves down. Since it has moved down, MT4 and the EA have nothing to send since it is waitng for one tick "Above" TP 1 before it sends it modification to the remaining two orders.

Fortunately it does not happen often and I believe in the theory of "More often than not". More often than not the PA moves at least two ticks above TP1 and MT4 and the EA do their job fine. But their will be those instances where the PA moves just to the TP1 and drops, especially if TP1 is at a S/R point.

Thank you for that, to both you and johnny and everyone else putting their 2 cents in. I am still new at the MT4 screenshot thing, but I will work on something. If anything I can add helps, great. If I say something that seem like totally off the wall or something "everybody" already knows, I apologize. But hey, that's what these forums are all about, sharing ideas and each of us are at our own level of experience.

thank you

bonjour.

je voudrais savoir si une personne pouvait modifier ce expert advisor pour que les heures  soit calculer automatiquement en fonction de notre brocker cela éviterais de faire des erreurs cela est possible ?

A great positive outcome, thanks guys.

Sq, whilst we ponder how best to sit the box, could I request in the meantime a mod/ simple enhancement on the existing ea. Just as we have "Limit box to max", can we have "Expand box to min". The idea is that this way, I can actually specify a box size of say 20. which will give me 20 if the range is higher, or 20 if the range is lower.

Like Phreddy, I am also looking at the 06:630 range - often it can be very small ie less that 8 pips, in which case chances are that you may hit s/l pretty frequently. At a range of say 20 then, I have hopefully taken some of the risk away.

Additionally, obviously, I will have a more reasonable tp.

I thank you for your work, alongwith the many others I have pointed in this direction!!

Regards

Pardy

It took me several minutes to understand that one...

Tell me if i got it right:

What you're saying is that the Stochastic indicator code invokes one of the OHLC lines to determine the hi/lo over the given %K period:

High[],Low[] and Close[] for the regular Stochastic indi,

High[] only for the StochHigh,

and Low[] only for the StochLow that you posted,

Correct ?

There is very tiny difference between regular stoch, stochHigh and stochLow resulting lines.

How do you extract any useful information from their differences ?

How do you determine a trend from a stochastic line ?

When it goes to extreme zones (OB/OS), this does not give you the direction of the trend, unless the stoch period is long enough (several hours).

When a trend forms, the stoch will go into the OB/OS area.

Once it is there, you cannot determine if the trend is continuing or if it is exhausted: in either case it will stay in the OB/OS area for quite a long time before moving back to the middle zone.

The stoch will move from the OS/OB area back into the middle zone if price retraces.

But this also happens when price stays around the same level during more than roughly half of the stoch period.

Using multiple stochs with different periods should help defferentiate the various cases, I haven't gone into that yet.

We can build a stochastic-based trend indicator if you explain the rules.

RSI would be a better trend detector.

Put an RSI(20) on M5: when it reads >55 it's uptrend, <45 downtrend.

Well, this depends of course on how the magnitude you are looking for.

We are looking over

SteveHopwood uses that filter in many of his EAs.

It's probably not the best trend detector in the world, but it does quite a good job.

I built for myself a modified version of the #MTF_RSI, which i called #MTF_dualRSI, that plots the main RSI as a histogram, and shows the 45-55 zone. (it also plots a secondary "entry" RSI, but we're not interested in it right now).

Attached here for everyone to try out.

However, the basic principle of the strategy is again to use the calm zone to form our (small) box, and wait for momentum to produce breakout, and start from there.

By definition, the calm zone will not give you any reliable trend direction...

That's why we trade both directions on the breakout.

i'll check that one, sure.

SQ

Thanks for that post, Johnny. Whilst I think I understand your broad suggestion, could I perhaps ask you two questions just to get the idea firmly in my mind.

1. Since TP0 is the edges of the box, you are saying that we can take the trade whilst within the box, when price reaches TP0, you are already looking to take 1st profit. Would a reasonable way of doing this be if stochs have bottomed or topped out and then there is a cross of PA over the Gann line?

2. At the moment, how would you draw that box range. Is that the actual range say within the times placed, say if it were 20 pips. You would then draw a 20 pip box at a support or resistance. How would you decide which?

Or would the range of the box be the most immediate support/resistance point.

3. What would be very helpful, certainly to me, would be if you could show that in a series of chart from start, point out s/r (chart1), where the box should go(chart2), and where the trade should be taken(chart3), and finally, at what point you would start the process again by redrawing the box and where(chart4).

Hope its not too much to ask, your posts have already helped me in this context.

Thanks.

EA uses the broker time, just like all your MT4 charts.

MT4 only knows about the broker time.

Local time is accessible programmatically, but is not used in the EA.

The Comment area of the EA (up left corner) gives you all known times.

Go to post #433, it explains all you need to find out your box and session times.

Hey SQ,

Are you running the latest EA?  Why would my ea reach mart sec 1597?  My settings are default except for the start/end times.  [See post 627]

Not sure what I'm doing wrong.....

Ok, here ya go. These are my backtesting results and settings. I have only run live for the past week and am carrying a 92% winning rate. Had first lost yesterday on GBP false breakout. Thanks to Johnny, I now have added a S/R indicator to choose whether I will manually allow the trade to enter or not. Times are based on GMT +3 (FXDD). So far, I have only been able to optimize 3 pairs, EURUSD, EURJPY and GBPUSD. My goal (like ours) is to find a time frame that was consistantly profitable over the last year. Also, that is the only data I have through FXDD BT data that I have been able to get to work. Nothing in this post is to take away from the strategy, just my playing with the settings to obtain a more consistant equity curve without the martingale. Nothing against it, just don't have the bank for it. From these tests and settings, I figure I will need a $500 bank per .01 lot, per pair.

First, my settings...

Thank you, Scotty B.

I agree with you that if we can find settings that work well without resorting to Martingale, then this really is the preference. I cannot watch the charts at trading times to check for SR near the trade, so I am excited to see the ideas that are developing here which would push win rate and profitability up.

(Your manual intervention seems to be boosting win rate from 80% to 90% area, which is great.)

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Which one? Please PM me if you don't want to post an indi on mer's thread. Always checking out good SR indi's   I also found that the success rate was higher when the price was more in the middle of the box at the time that it formed, but didn't develop a system for it, though.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Panthere,

You can go here and extract the code for auto GMT/DST adjustment I provided for the EA and insert it in the indi. You'll see, it's quite straigthforward.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
CelticHeart,

On JohnnyBSmarts post 587 there is an offset semafore indi that works pretty well. There is also some others out there I am experimenting with.

I am finding it useful in not only avoiding bad entries, but when it looks like a breakout will not hit my target due to hitting one of these points, I take the opportunity to close the trades in profit before PA heads the opposite direction.

GLTA!

Here is yesterday and today's chart (I do use this Live). I use the original LBO set-up but the modded EA code I posted in this thread.

4 Wins yesterday on 4 entries and 5 today on 3 entries. (it's been like this since I started Live few weeks back).

My philosophy: LBO is meant to quickly extract some pips. It's not a long term strategy as per "order-life". So I'm quickly stacking pips, I don't let orders run as I want to limit my DD and chances of reversal.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Beside the original EA entry point yesterday, every blue square you see is a manual entry I made, and every blue "Check-Sign" is an exit for whether "modified TP1, TP2 and TP3". As soon as TP1 is hit, I move the remaining 2 orders at BE+5 (my broker has an average of 2.5spread).

I use whatever comes first for TP: Fib-Support/Resistance or Original TP as detailed by Mer's strategy. See how many pips I extracted from the market.

Relating to your method, you may see on the previous chart that today I did not exit at Pivot level. This is because I have a minimum deviation I believe should be respected with the box lower band (today it was 6-7pips, it's too close to my BE). 15pips, I would have slide TP1 to Pivot level and stack few pips in my pocket.

Going back to not trading because of S/R I agree only if the Box size is that of Pivot/Sup or Res, or actually include the whole Pivot/Sup/Res .. yes it happens over time (I remember that occurred few times in backtesting 2005 and 2006.) and can actually relate this to volatility so it makes total sense to me.

However, were I'm heading right now is to dynamically adapt the Box range with respect to how close it is to one of S/R. This does not mean moving the box, it means moving up/down one of upper/lower box band so as to let enough deviation with S/R as per my standards.

I will not go back to my whole explanation and illustration that I provided earlier during my kinda discussion with Johnny (basically, not putting the lower/upper box limit at S/R while considering the original Box set-up) but if anyone is interested, PM me, I will gladly share where I go, specifically if you are the kind of guy that puts his money where his mouth is. Eventually, will come back and post the results once this strategy is more thoroughly tested.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Squalou,

Here is the "fix" I use live.

At the beginning of the Start{} loop, simply look if there is one order less than in the previous run of Start{} at tick-1.

If so, check History for Open (you don't to move TP2 and 3 to BE if what closes was a previous order running), if Open was today, then TP1 was hit, move TP2 and 3.

Done, simple, and independent of any price-trigger. (let me know if there is anything wrong)

X.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Let's look at box positions to understand the whys and wherefores of the best box positions.

The first chart shows the M15 and different box positions. The ultimate positions are quite obvious highlighted in Aqua. The PA is all headed in one direction and it's back up the truck and load the pips. These very rarely occur spot on the London Open or any Open for that matter. If you put the box on top or below these your stops will never be hit.

Now let's look at the BAD BOX POSITION depicted as a dark orange rectangle with an "X". This is the position the program initially put the box and when I refreshed the screen it jumped up to the GOOD BOX POSITION.

I want you to think of the PA action as a highway and this highway has big rigs running 80 MPH in one direction. Would you want to stand in their way? Well putting the box inline with the PA trend is exactly the same thing. The Bad position Box is going to get hit and I guarantee you're going to lose some pips and your bank account is going to need resuscitating.

The GOOD BOX is within the confines of the start and end times and is acceptable to keep us out of harms way. The problem is the bottom of the box is below the last line of resistance and therefore is open for a hit on any retrace.

The FAIR BOX POSITION depicted in dark blue is also way below the last line of resistance and again may be hit with a retrace. Why play near the highway and get run over by a truck?

The BEST BOX POSITION is at the line of the last point of resistance. Weak but resistance all the same.

Now let's look at the same chart but on the H1. You see the FAIR box getting run over. The BAD box had a narrow miss and the first trade would have been a loser with the standard method. There are no losers on the

other box positions. The standard method would have put the box just above the BAD box and directly in harms way. Not a good choice.

Now let's look at the same chart but on the H4 chart. All the noise as they say is gone and only the ULTIMATE POINTS of support and resistance remain. Notice the vertical red lines depicting the London Open which show all of them nowhere near the swing highs or the swing lows.

In all cases and on every chart please notice the stochastic indicators which show price exhaustion every single time.

Where do you want your box?

Happy trades and stay out of the way of those big rigs.

Johnny

Johnny...........................WHILE your advice about 4H charts is excellent, I get a headache looking the charts you uploaded, what are you trying to show here..............I can't make anything out of your charts.....just confusion.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
squalou,

My personal opinion is the RSI is way over rated and I will not use it on a chart. The standard stochastics is a fairly good indicator but peaks to quickly or never reaches the top before turning. On long wick candles you have to be watching it to see the price hit the high as the final stochastics value is the closing value which is purely worthless. The RSI moves so little it's hard to see if it is alive or dead and again the closing value is the problem as is with all indicators. The closing value is showing what's left after the profit takers got done with it. I don't want the left overs.

Every indicator I use I alter the code to show the High value and the low value. I close my positions based on either hitting resistance or support and the indicators value. If both indicators are at 100 for both the K & D values and the PA is at resistance the price will reverse.

Using the closing value for anything is crazy as this is a meaningless number. Why would I want to wait for the close to make a buy or sell position. I will pull the trigger on the high of an up candle which occurs late in the formation of the candle as then the PA will then retreat to the close. On a down candle I will take the high which occurs first before going down to the low and back up for the close.

As far as determining trend a standard deviation or linear regression works very well but with the M15 it is a small amount of time. We are dealing with a two to four hour period and if we just gotta have that first trade exactly at 3:00 EST then we are looking at the trend of the M15 at a very short interval of time which is the whole problem. The standard method places the box in the middle of a four lane highway and we are getting run over by a big rig.

quoted by squalou:
the basic principle of the strategy is again to use the calm zone to form our (small) box, and wait for momentum to produce breakout, and start from there.

This just isn't true and I challenge you to look at any chart and show me where this occurs before 3:00 EST. There is no calm zone. We are not making money on the volume ups and downs but only the price action. Volume may be taking a break before the LO but the price sure doesn't and that's why this isn't working so well at the LO.

There are exactly zero break outs at the LO. Why? Because a break out by definition requires a consolidation of price which depicts market indecision. Once direction is established by either more sellers then buyers or the other way around then and only then does the price break out of consolidation.

So what do we really have here. It's simply lower volume sometime during the Asian session on some days. That's all we see so what is happening prior to the LO. A lot of price movement starting after midnight.

But since this thread is about the London Open let's try to keep the theme the same and see what we can do to improve it from that standpoint.

Determining the box placement off the last #3 semafor would give us PA direction but not necessarily the trend but who really cares as long as we make positive pips. The other problem being is that knowing direction off the last pivot point doesn't tell us price exhaustion as far as the last candle is concerned if that candle is a long time away from the last #3 pivot. This is only a problem if time is entered into the equation which is my point with a floating box. A linear regression channel from the last pivot would show the relationship of the PA to the outside channels and hence whether making a trade is a wise decision. The placement of the box would be above the down direction and below the up direction. The best placement assuming the box position is not totally time restricted would be at a #3 pivot.

The chart below shows this movement of the box and the advantages are many. We placed the initial box to catch a directional move which in this case was a with the M15 trend move. When a #3 semafor appeared at the end of the initial move the box moved to this position and now we play the counter trend move down. This box movement places the box at a more favorable and stronger point of resistance minimizing the chance of a stop loss hit.

The second chart shows the next movement of the box which again protects from a stop loss hit and also takes the box out of the consolidation area and resulting oscillating PA which would drive us nuts sitting on the initial boxes buy line.

As you can see we didn't have a losing trade. I believe this is the method we should strive for in either method as after the 3:00 Open it is no longer a London Open thingie.

The #3 chart shows the standard method which as you can see is a complete train wreak.

Only one little question to the great thinkers: did you think to use as box the bars 1 hour before news?

In the chart below is a system in development (the boxes are not the right).

In the lower window the green histograms show the small BarRanges according to which follow large movements, which one can trade with great safety.

This is my 200% Accurate Method ...

Hi Swingman,

That looks interesting. I know of someone who trades red news, using 15 min charts, where he will take a breakout of the candle with the news - on the assumption that traders have decided by then what direction to move price based on the news.

Could you please post your indicator you are using, looks very good.

Many thanks.

stupid question (anyway I'm not a clever girl :-))

If  this method works is what is increasingly known not likely to destroy  it because it is sufficient that the bulk (banks, institutional etc. ..)  know our points of entry and they can stop us easily and thus save a  lot money because we have not so?

or the fact that it is known by more and more people fueling this method?

FRENCH

question bête ( de toute façon je suis pas une fille intelligente :-) )

si cette methode fonctionne le fait quelle soit de plus en plus connue ne risque pas de la détruire  car il suffit que les gros ( banques ,institutionnelle etc..) connaissent nos points d'entrée et ils pourrons nous contrer facilement  et donc gagner pas mal d'argent grâce a nous oui non ?

ou bien le fait quelle soit connus par de plus en plus de monde alimente cette méthode ?

been using that for a while (since LBO V1 actually!) and works really great.

Put it on M1 charts.

Very nice, this is the mini box news trading...!

But is also possible to use the macro box with the same or other trading rules, at least with martingale...

--- 帖子 #660 ---
You are right! The blue and red histograms identify very good the market impulses. They identify with 90% precision the daily events. Interesting is that for some pairs they gives signals 15-30 minutes before the events (the rest of 10%).

Possible is every time to trade the PA after such impulses (Shockwave theory), and the other possibility is to identify statisticaly the times of the appearances.

Here the Vola indicator for you...

--- 帖子 #665 ---
nightingale,

I wish that were true but this thread is trend challenged and that's why the box is all wrong. The London Open usually begins a Big Money counter trend trade that takes out the "with the trend" retail traders Stop Loss placements and leaves them with their face in their crying towels. The change in direction entices some to jump into the counter trend move they started. The more money they can convince of this reversed direction the more money that will be made when they suddenly sell their positions and reverse the direction again. They play this game all day long but this is their bread and butter time.

This doesn't always work for very long and a return to a "with the trend trade" is inevitable. After this little game is played the PA runs fast to support or resistance because of the volume increase. The PA isn't changing it's course in any way shape or form and would have reached it's destination in due time anyway. The PA just moves faster due to volume and hence the misconception of a breakout move.

Learn first then trade,

Johnny

thanks goes to the thread starter for this good strategie and indicators. i modified it a little bit. my bo box starts from 0:00am till 7:00am (gmt +2) during asia session. if london begins, i draw one parallel line from the first highest high to second and put the downline on the lowest low, or vice versa first lowest low to second and the downline on highest high (like screenshot) to get a second channel. i think the most of the time that gets the bo earlier. after breaking one of this lines i open only one order with tp 30 and sl 20. if the market choppy (bo is about 30 pips) i will use the horizontal lines. i used it on gbpjpy and sometimes on gbpusd.

thanks Johnny, i am like getting 50% of your strategy.. i know you are not obligated to but if you could include some examples would be really great, i am all ears and all heart to learn. One big question is how do we have it has stretched out the the unusual high or low and if its high enough ot low enough to enter trade...

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hi Johnny,

In your charts on post 646, e.g., you give the best box position as sited just above resistance. The bottom of the box is thus at the resistance line. Whilst this would prevent a trade going long as it is likely to lose, where would you actually take a trade, since price does not enter the box itself. What would the trade trigger be?

Also, in that case, how do you determine the range, and if we are looking to trade "outside" the box as it were, why would the range actually matter?

Hope you will address this.

Thanks

Pardy

Hi Swingman,

Could I request you to kindly post your news trading lines indicator, please.

Pardy,

The trade is taken as close to the box as possible. I use the Bols-9-2 and the High and Low Stochastics set at 14-3-1 with Momentum Indicators set at 10. A trade is taken after the completion of the move. In your example the move would be an up move to resistance.

The box to me is just visual thing depicting the Open. I do not wait for the 3:00 EST to make a trade. The semaphor that I'm using forms very quickly although it can and will repaint. Confirmation is essential to confirm the trade. You can also use the Gann indicator set at 3 and buy at a cross.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Squalou,

I modified  Inserted Code void MoveSLwhenProfit(int profit_pips_target, int pips_to_lock)
as currently, there was the Order3 issue not moving to BE+ and, I realized that if I trade on M30 instead of M15, it does not handle the Move the BE+ for Order3 at any time.

I used your variables but rewrite the complete logic based on price action.

Logic:

@TP1, move order2 and order3 to order1+BE

@TP2, move order3 to TP1+BE -> you may not want this if you want to let Order3 ride ... I personally prefer to lock-in pips.

This can be improved.

Here is the code:
Inserted Code if ( OrderType() == OP_SELL )
{
if (Ask <= SellTP2 && OrderStopLoss() >= SellTP1-BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip)
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), SellTP1-BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip, OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
else if (Ask <= SellTP1 && OrderStopLoss() >= OrderOpenPrice()-(BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip))
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), OrderOpenPrice()-(BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip), OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
}
else if (OrderType() == OP_BUY)
{
if (Ask >= BuyTP2 && OrderStopLoss() <= BuyTP1+BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip)
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), BuyTP1+BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip, OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
else if (Ask >= BuyTP1 && OrderStopLoss() <= OrderOpenPrice()+BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip)
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), OrderOpenPrice()+BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip, OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
}
In this manner, moving to BE+ is no more TF dependent and everyone should be able to enjoy only a more profitable EA. Again, if you copy/paste that in place of the previous function logic, everyone one should backtest/forward better results.

If not, let me know.

X.

SQ, here is a variation, I simply played a little with the SL for order2. In my yearly 2004-now backtest, this maintains the DD at a max of 45%, not too bad for a martingale system.

Inserted Code double HalfLvl2;
if ( OrderType() == OP_SELL )
{
HalfLvl2 = MathAbs(SellTP2-SellTP1)/2;
if (Ask <= SellTP2+HalfLvl2 && OrderStopLoss() >= OrderOpenPrice()-HalfLvl2)
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), OrderOpenPrice()-HalfLvl2, OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
else if (Ask <= SellTP1 && OrderStopLoss() >= OrderOpenPrice()-(BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip))
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), OrderOpenPrice()-(BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip), OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
}
else if (OrderType() == OP_BUY)
{
HalfLvl2 = MathAbs(BuyTP2-BuyTP1)/2;
if (Ask >= BuyTP2-HalfLvl2 && OrderStopLoss() <= OrderOpenPrice()+HalfLvl2)
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), OrderOpenPrice()+HalfLvl2, OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
else if (Ask >= BuyTP1 && OrderStopLoss() <= OrderOpenPrice()+BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip)
{_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), OrderOpenPrice()+BreakEvenProfitInPips*pip, OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);}
}
However, this does not pull out as much additional pips as I thought, although it does not reduce the profits neither.

Beside correcting the bug I had, I realized that the Auto-GMT library does not work properly ... specifically if you start the EA at specific dates such as .... october 25th - october 31th (if you dont know why, check note1, and then explanation in note2 .. if still no clue go back to note1).

Until I figured out how to do this automatically, I prevent the EA from trading the last week of March/October, but still automatically adjust for GMT the rest of the year.

note1: If you have no clue what this means, I suggest you do not use my modded version and use SQ's one  until I can provide some code that does not require any understanding  .... not a big deal but calendar programming is a messy subject.

note2: here is what I need to do to handle all this automatically - if backtesting starts on october 28th, I need to check the previous day up until the 25th, and check whether or not that is a sunday, for which case we are already in winter time ! I know, a hell of a headache.

The bad: all this mess if for automatically handling London DST time ... .

The ugly: what about USA that changed the time on which to set DST in 2007 (if I remember) - well that means that one need a real calendar function to do correct backtesting other than for London breakout.

I'll think about it but I guess there is no choice but to have a hash table of every DST time switch since 1999, for every country one wants to trade - SQ, for that purpose, I think I need to go back to the indi I pointer you earlier.

note3: To the backtesters .... if some adventurous ones tried to investigate few years back for different BreakOut (in terms of London, NY, Asian, News) .... well I hope you made sure all the above were consistent to have a meaningful result

Hi Johnny,

If by #3a you mean using the sema with s/r, then yes. Works well in avoiding stupid trades, I use price action for triggers, such as 3 bar reversal/ engulfing bars etc.

Pardy

--- 帖子 #684 ---
johnny,

While the box is forming, ZZ-sema will follow the  highest/lowest bars.

On sep 2, you end up with the ZZ showing the BOTTOM  side as the best place at the time the box has formed.

Here is the 3-zz-sema at  the end of the box on sep 2 (GU):

as you can see, the sema #2 is at the bottom, so the box should be put there as per your rule:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A few bars later, it may become a different story because the ZZ have repainted, and sema 2 may have moved further and leave just the #1 at its previous position, giving your final picture.

However, I must have different settings thean yours, because i can't get the #2 to move away:

i use periods 5/10/34, dev_step 1,3/7,5/13,8.

What are yours ?

If you're changing them for every picture you post, we won't be able to follow you... can you post the settings along with the pictures so we can give it a try?

On sep 3, it's even more obvious:

at 7h45(gmt+2): box would be placed at the BOTTOM ("good" position, but that's told "once the war is over"...)

Attached Image

But at 9h00, the box is finally placed on the TOP because #3 is now up there, and #2 has disappeared (actually #2 and #3 now overlap):

with all these #3 at the top, how would you figure that it's not the "strong" resistance that we should use ?

Attached Image

At the end of the battle:

Hummm... easy to find the "good" positions at the end of the day, but in the middle of the battle, it's a different story...

Johnny B, I am sure that you have a wonderful solution but there are so many of us bemused by it. You seem to be against a wall of doubters here and I suspect that when Mer re-appears he will say that it is not his basic scheme.

Could you take it to another thread where only your idea is posted? I would dearly like to understand but with all the 'opposition' I get too confused.

I don't feel that the 3t system is needed if you have a way of placing the box for a breakout.

It also does not have to be London Breakout.

I am pursuing an idea of 30 min ranges for breakouts through the day your idea seems to be in tune with that.

Hi All

I've been running the EA as standard (apart from resize factor 1.2) for two days. First day with auto martingale, +61 pips. Today with no martingale, only because I forgot to set it, I'm already 177 pips in profit and +164 pips in open trades  trading GBP/USD, Eur/Usd, Eur/jpy, Usd/Jpy.

I hope every day is like this, if so it won't be long before I've got this on a live account. Seriously though great concept Mer, and thanks for the Ea Sqalou.

I wish i'd found this system earlier.

Cheers

Hi Johnny

Now, I would never try try to suggest that what you're doing is wrong, but...

isn't your method just trading from a semafor alert and then setting your TP and SL levels from your placement of the box ?

What I mean is, it's not a box breakout anymore, therefore not Mer's system.

I only ask after trying to follow this thread I feel it's starting to get mightily confusing with all these different ideas and indi's that are popping up.

Cheers

Simmo

Hi Johnny,

you have completely taken over mer's thread: you put your beautiful and good ideas in front of, you teachest the members, you give squalou advices  etc.

In every post you are against the London Breakout idea of this thread, and you recommend other ideas that are very good.

How other members here, I would like to ask you to present your wonderful ideas in a new thread which has nothing to do with LBO.

Squalou or other coders can improve the old systems, or working on a new one, what they find to be good.

I believe that mer will start a new thread "LBO 3", because you have hijacked his thread...

A few years earlier I had made a similar recommendation  to @spieler, and his was one of the most visited threads in forum.

FXMajors,

I think you are over-positionned @8lots for a 50k account. I would suggest no more than (50000/2500)*0.01 = 0.2lots to be on the safe side while playing with a Mart component.

Also SL is a good idea

Hello FXMajors,

What is the idea of your red lines? How do you calculate them?

Rgds,

RL

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Squalou and co. (I know mer is on vacation...)

Are we still on track for a '5-tier' target system instead of the current '3-tier'? I know someone had mentioned it on this thread before. Nothing else in the strategy/system changes, except of course, you'll have 5 TPs instead of 3.

I can see lots of merit in having a '5-tier' target EA. It gives you just a bit more flexibility, will add to overall profitability and ,in my opinion, works better than having a built-in trailing stop.

Thanks and keep doing what you're doing!

Just to clarify

In the previous post I was not referring to the indy that we're currently trading and testing, but to an EA.

Ok, thanks Swingman. I hope this thread can get back to what the title says.

I've only just found it !

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Hi,

the EA still trades only the 3-tier version currently.

You can still setup the 3-tier so that its far end (TP3) is your 5-tier far end (TP5).

A 5-tier version EA would open 5 trades instead of 3.

That has also to be taken into consideration, as it will be 5 x losses if SL is hit.

SQ

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Hello Squalou,

We will really apreciate, as much as we appreciate your current work , if you release EA with fixed moving to BE after hiting TP1 and with GMT time recalculator. If you could also add MaxProfitPerDay it would be great.

Thanks and regards,

RL

--- 帖子 #705 ---
There's probably a nice simple solution.

Start a thread called "London Open Semaphor Bounce System, with Trailing Box Stop", whatever. It's an interesting and potentially profitable system (with the repainting Semaphor problem), but NOT a box breakout system. SwingTrader is correct.

Spare us the psychodrama, pontification and dissertations and long essays, please.

It would be great on another thread. You can moderate it.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Tell you what here's an idea, open up a chart, add your semaphor indi plot your support and resistance, draw a fib for your Take profit levels and Bobs your auntie !!

Who needs a box. Oh ! but of course thats Johnnys idea, damn I was going to start my own thread there.

Maybe I will start a thread for you , Johnny and people who like his ideas.

Then maybe us "newbies" who don't contribute can do what the original author wanted and try to learn his system.

I am new to the threads (LBO and LBOv2) since having started reading them over the weekend.  I have been watching the London open for a while and am excited to find EAs that can autotrade at that time (unfortunately, I am New York time/ET).  Thanks to Mer, squalou and Steve and others for making it happen...

I look forward to testing the 3 tiered system and finding the best pair and start/end combination.  For anyone that's tested this for a while, have you found less is more (ie, fewer pairs equal greater profit or the opposite).  And is the default gap duration (adjusted for time zone of course) proving to be the best?  Comments appreciated, thank you!

Welcome. Feel free to check out my post at #639. It shows three pairs that I have narrowed down to be consistantly profitable for me. I time optimized these pairs as I do not have the bank for an effective martingale.

@Squalou

I know this is more of a PM type of question, but since I am a junior member I don't know how else to ask...

Recently I've been testing a Breakout strategy using the LBO V.2 indi and your amazing EA. instead of placing the initial box for 3 hours, I only place it for the 2 15min candles of 8:15-8:30 Pacific ( I believe it's -7 GMT at the moment) MaxBox=20, MinBox=2, end time is default. Since the box is so small moves can blast through the three TP's rather quickly. Will the EA set the BE+1 up to the TP3 line if I change the TP number in the EA? I find this spot a great point to lock in pips while also getting ready for another 20+ pips where I can get out at my choosing. Maybe a trailing stop after TP3?

Also, TP1 and TP2 aren't closing a trade, is this normal?

Thanks a lot for all your hard work creating these tools for us all to use!

cheers,

Brochington

FXMajors,

Since you're using the JBS modified version I will tell you. You need to set the minimum and maximum pip settings the same for the two charts to be the same. On one you show 5, 20 and the other I believe is 15, 80.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #715 ---
JB

Both charts have the same value which is the default values...

--- 帖子 #716 ---
FXMajors,

On the top of the chart they show the input settings which are different. Recheck the input values. Are you using the same template? Also there is no EA yet for the 3B version. The 3b version was a modified still under construction project.

It is not a break out of the box style method. It is a break from support or resistance style method. The box breakout version is 3a. Both can be traded manually and in the same manner. The only difference is the trade is made from a bounce from the box and not a break through the box. It is also best to trade off the bounce when the bounce occurs instead of waiting for the London Open. Both are momentum trades on the direction of the price action and the actual breakout is one of volume resulting in fast price moves.

The initial move may be a false short move with the second move the real break from present price level. One never knows for sure without other means of verifying price exhaustion. I use confirmation before every trade but that is your choice. Mer's method is a break out of the box believing the break is confirmation of a long run to the take profit level. It is your decision which version you want to trade although Mer might delete 3b upon his return.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Good morning all!

FXMajors,

Alpari UK is GMT +2. My settings are for GMT +3. Simply subtract 1 hour from the start and end times for the box and you should be good to go.

Ah, the light dawns with a clear explanation.

Many thanks Johnny

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Phreddy,

You are welcome. Here is how I would trade Mer's version 3a. See the attached mer-#1 chart below.

MinBoxSizeInPips = 10;     // min tradable box size; when box is smaller than that, you should at least reduce your usual lot-size if you decide to trade it;

MaxBoxSizeInPips = 10;     // max tradable box size; don't trade when box is larger than that value

LimitBoxToMaxSize = true; // when true, a box larger than MaxBoxSizeInPips will be limited to MaxBoxSizeInPips, and centered on the EMA(box_time_range) value.

StickBoxToLatestExtreme = true;  // (applies when "LimitBoxToMaxSize" is true) when true, the box will "stick" to the box high or low, whichever comes last; else it will be centered on the EMA(box_time_range) value;

TP1Factor    = 20.000;

TP2Factor; // set to half-way between TP1Factor and TP3Factor;

TP3Factor    = 60.000;

TP4Factor; // set to half-way between TP3Factor and TP5Factor;

TP5Factor    = 100.000;// TP4 and TP5 targets are OPTIONAL: set TP5Factor=0 to allow only up to TP3 target;

SLFactor     = 1.000;

LevelsResizeFactor = 1.0;

These settings adjust version 3a to trade close to 3b. The box becomes more manageable and still provides a some confirmation of direction. If you want more conformation the you can increase the MinBoxSizeInPips = 20 and the MaxBoxSizeInPips = 20 or some other higher number.

See the attached mer-#2 chart below.

Remember the stop loss setting (SL) is based on the box settings so if your box is 10 pips then the SL is 10 pips.

This should clear up some things on the settings.

You will notice on chart #2 the box on the left of the chart is a winner coming out of the box while the box on the right becomes a loser with an immediate sell short out of the box. This is an example of the bad trades I was trying to fix before the blow up on this thread. I think mer would have approved of this attempt at fixing this problem. It's just too bad people can't just read the thread before posting untruths. Fixing this problem doesn't require opening a new thread it requires discussion and ideas. This bad trade out of the box occurs way too often. Hence the "BIG FAT ZERO" post.

Trying to get people to understand sometimes takes a baseball bat across the head. Simply pointing out this problem was not getting the message across. The Martingale system is an attempt to cover up these bad trades and ignore the underlying problem. This will sometimes only exasperate the problem but the problem will never go away. Damn me and my methods if you wish but you will end up the loser. Your vote so far is to leave these losing trades alone. Are you ready to reconsider? I alone do not have all the answers to making a great system and that is why we posted openly to show and discuss out in the open. Discussing only behind the scenes is limiting the input of all the traders here. We have traders with experience like SwingMan visiting this thread. Why shut down the ideas from the masses by discussing in the dark? Mer, Squalou and others have got us to where we are now but we are quite a way from greatness. Being relentless in improving this system is the only way it will get better. Attacking the very people that have already doubled the profit of this system will only stop any further improvement. The choice is yours.

Trade well and prosper,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #722 ---
All Traders,

This chart of MER's version 3a is showing the explanations "FROM" and "THROUGH" as I posted earlier. The PA movement from support is not necessarily going to continue it's upward move from the bounce off support although the increase in volume beginning two hours before the open usually results in longer moves.

The question always in your mind, "is the #3 low the reversal point"? There are many ways traders confirm the move but none are right 100% of the time. One way is a break through prior SR points as shown on the chart. Number 1, 2 and 3 are all breaks of support or resistance levels with #2 being the one I would choose. Yes I choose to trade within the box but that's the way I trade. This can be done with an adjustment of the box size to 28 pips as shown in chart #2. To do this go to the user input menu and adjust the MaxBoxSizeInPips = 28. Note any number can be entered but too low a number effects the SL setting so an input of five(5) is also your SL setting.

I would be looking to take profit if no break through occurred at #3. The problem with a large box setting is the wasted profit and the chance the move up will never reach the take profit level and reverse to the stop loss.

This is exactly what would have happened if the TP levels were not adjusted as shown in the chart. The TP1 would have been at 57 pips or 114 pips from the pivot point. To me this is wishful thinking because of the size of the move.

The lesson here is to watch the prior S & Rs and set your box size within reason to maximize your chances of success.

SwingMan,

I'm sure Mer would welcome your input and valuable experience on this thread. Mer's system is working fine but we still have the box placement which could be improved. Any improvement in making the initial trade a win would be great. Mer's method doesn't seem to need much help after the first trade. Improvements have been made and the win/loss I'm sure has improved from the beginning but more wins are always welcome. Thanks for your post.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #725 ---
I am totally with you Johnny as per confirming entry point with a S/R retracement @ minor level (second-order) S/R confirmation after major level (first-order) S/R testing. I would not change the box size, but would simply enter earlier.

This is Mer's version 3a, with an enhanced entry point. It is no different in essence than Mer's CT strategy. Exit as you wish.

X.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Ok, Sharks it's not feeding time.

X,

You state you would NOT change the box size. But if you look at this example the box need only be set to 20 pips in the Maxpips user input menu to break through a good point of resistance to confirm the trade. The 55 pip setting is just a waste of 35 pips in profit. The TP1 is also too far away and has little chance of success reaching that level. The adjusted setting is at 40 pips profit now where the standard setting is going to make zero. Not setting the MaxBox to true and the Max Pips to 20 will kill this trade.

Leaving the Box size at 55 pips makes this trade a loser and dead money. The chart on the right show the adjustment if the MAXpips input were changed to 20 and the MaxBox to true.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Johnny, you are too aggressive for me. Instead of passing through the door I just opened, you slammed it and make your point that this is actually your home.

So be it. I'm no more willing to keep this conversation with you.

A wise man would have ask: " if not downsizing the box size, what are you willing to do in this example", instead of taking one example, where you make your point ... for the benefits of yourself.

I'm sorry but I tried my best. You are not a nickname I'm willing to exchange idea with (as you may have multiples and this personification .... I don't like) .

Profitable trading to everyone.

X.

PS: let the winners ride, and cut-short the losers .... that means you have to learn to take a hit to be overall profitable. That is the whole point of a martingale system.

PPS: Do you understand that seeking for these S/R boxes is a new strategy whereas making use of S/R (known retracement stategies) for a better/earlier entries is still the same strategy ?

--- 帖子 #728 ---
X,

Trading the Asian Session is not like trading the London Session with a great increase in volume. Trading with a wish and a prayer anytime is not my style. Trading should NOT be done with a gambler's mind set as this is not a casino. This thread is not called the Martingale system and is only the users choice if he/she wants to use it.

Whether you use the martingale system or not every trade should be done with intelligence and not with hope. The chart set-up here tells me the PA will likely turn down at some point after the upper channel is hit. Trading with intelligence is not a new strategy. The term "Letting your winners run and cutting your losers does not imply you have to take losing trades" It means don't sell your trades until the PA has exhausted it's move. If you make a bad trade don't hang onto it wishing it will suddenly go your way. Close the loser and live to trade another day.

You say looking for prior S & Rs is a new strategy for determining the box size which I disagree. What do you think this is a break out of? Why do you think the input values are adjustable by the user which include time, Box size, Box placement and TP Fib levels or Pip TP levels. Not everybody wants an 80 pip high box with a TP1 at 80 pips. Who would let 160 pips go by before taking profit? I call that wishful thinking unless you use some other means of determining that the PA will reach that level.

You seem to take everything personally when someone disagrees with you. I posted with Mer's 3a version and the new traders in mind and not whether you would take some preconceived issue with the words. You didn't say anything beyond not changing the box size. I believe this is not the way to trade this method and is just wasting profit. The box in the example was drawn from a high to low and in this case the high was minor resistance but high enough to become a reversal point. Why trade into an ambush and get slaughtered?

It is your choice to trade anyway you like and post it if you wish. I for one do not like taking a hit and will avoid it whenever I see it coming. No Mart in my trading I'll just stick to smart.

I have been playing with the settings for a while now and have tried several different pip sizes for the box and I have found that a box size of 20 - 25 pips tends to give the best results.  I have not done a lot of back testing and I was wondering what results others have had with the box sizing?

Perhaps you should read up a bit on the FX market and how it works. Banks and institutional buyers don't move against or with the trend, they SET the trend. Institutional money accounts for more than 90% of the FX trading volume - hedge funds, multinational companies, banks, insurances, pension funds. Less than 10% of the daily trading volume of 4.3 trillion USD is from private traders and investors.

For the very same reason, no bank or broker would ever bother to sabotage your EAs or "stop" you out. Wake up, no one cares about the few dollars you put in a mini account while the Big Boyz are trading trillions. 7 banks (Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Goldman et al) handle 77% of the daily trading volume and, again, they have better things to do than stopping you out.

I tend to agree that big boys won't be paying any attention to retail forex traders' account due to the small size compared to what they are trading. However, one of the reasons with the popularity with MT4 platform is that it allows the broker who offer it (i believe there are still very few good brokers among them) to "tweak" or "adjust" the price data feed to their favour in the detriment of their customers (retail forex traders). Having said that, i'm using a MT4 broker ... ...

Well everyone, I'm back!!!!

I hope everyone has had a great couple of weeks trading and have made some money while doing so. Since getting back I have gone through the past few weeks of posts and can honestly say that I am a little miffed by all the bickering and bashing going on. But, on the other hand, I am also glad to see creative juices flowing and some great ideas coming to the forefront.

First, I want to address JohnnyBSmart. Your posts are worded very intelligently and I feel you are very intuitive when it comes to using S & R and all that but, and please don't take this personally, you have a slightly abrasive way of presenting your thoughts and ideas which may come across as being rude to others. While you obviously make complete sense to yourself, several members (and not 1 or 2, but about a dozen) have pm'd me saying you are cluttering up the thread and making it more confusing to follow the original premise and I honestly have to agree with them. Again, I think your ideas are very interesting and have great merit and substance, but the delivery is a little rough around the edges, which apparently has offended some of the followers of this thread. With that in mind, numerous members have suggested to you that you should open a new thread regarding your ideas and I'm afraid I have to agree with them as well too. This method is a primarily a time based strategy with a little Fibonacci targeting thrown in for good measure. To me, when you change how the basis of the box is being derived, it is changing the strategy which is not what I want in my thread. If traders want to play around with inputs by changing targets or entry points, fine, those changes do not alter the main strategy, they just alter it to fit the traders comfort level, that's all. I'm pretty sure that if you open a new thread, others will follow and help you test and implement your theories. I will make every effort to support you in that endeavor by offering the indicators and EA's for you to modify as you wish to fit your unique style of trading and I might even stop in on occasion to check how you've progressed and maybe add my two cents in as well.

To everyone else, I also have to support Johnny as well as he was only looking for new, inventive ways to help with improving the strategy, and I can commend his diligence in the matter even though it may have came across a little harsh. But in the end, it is still my thread and I would like the bickering and judgmental attitudes to stop or I will be forced to lock the thread which is not going to help anyone. We are all here to learn and sometimes it takes a little patience and understanding with other traders to see the big picture.

Okay, now that I have that off my chest, I want to let everyone know that I will be buttoning up my next project this week and I won't be posting charts for a bit as that takes up a lot of my time that I need to devote to the new project. I'm sure by now that most of you have the concept down and are creatively testing out different entry points and targets. I will still be stopping on occasion to keep you guys in check and to try and answer any questions.

Oh, and for those who were wondering where I went, I just closed on my retirement present, paid in full.

Hello Mer,

Welcome back. I hope your vacation went well. We did stir up the ideas for a short while but the attackers stopped all of that short of greatness. I'm not at all surprised at your decision but must say it was fun for a short time although quite the headache in the end.

I think we were following a good path but understand it was all just for discussion and was not adjusting the end time of the box on the 3a version nor even the 3b version. Finding the best entries by the vertical positioning of the box was and still is a good idea. Trading based on Time without the correct trade direction is not going to increase the odds in your favor. One only has to look at a chart to see where the best results occurred. Why else do you keep a record of the results but to adjust the program?

I will gladly not post any more new ideas as it's not worth the effort. You will find those attackers as mostly visitors who never got past post #1. You once said you had thick skin which is nice because your going to need it.

Have a great life and thanks,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #735 ---
You must understand Johnny, my post was not intended to run you off but to encourage you to bring your ideas to a new thread where they can be discussed in more detail. I have had to close threads before because they went off in a totally different tangent, but that didn't stop me from posting other ideas for everyone to use and develop.

To not open a new thread because you can't post your ideas here or that you do not want to make the effort to open the thread yourself sounds a little selfish and lazy and that will not earn you any respect on these boards. I still think you have great ideas, so please reconsider the new thread. We'll just leave it at that and move on from here.

Hi Mer and welcome back.

Before you ride off into the blue with your new project could you explain, maybe in post #1, just what we are left with.

I am among those who got lost...

It is my intention to use the 3 trade indi on the Asian session and use the 3t EA to look after it. I don't have reliable internet nor reliable electric to demo it so it will have to be 'bit between my teeth' and go live with a small a/c and a micro lot with a broker offering VPS.

Thanks to you and SQ as well as all contributers.

JohnnyB, I will be looking for your thread to improve my Asian trades.

What is the latest indicator that should be used with this strategy?

I noticed on the first post v.3.1 is listed, but on the thumbnail for the thread theres is a v.3 & v.3.2b as well?

--- 帖子 #738 ---
The best thing to do is to re-read through the posts to find out what was changed in the indicators along the way. I am personally using V3.1. I will try and get ahold of sqaulou to try and find out what the latest versions are and post them in post #1. Phreddy, you may want to check with xmph to find out what settings he was using for smaller accounts.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Hi Mer,

Welcome back!

I had started updating the indi with some of Johnny suggestions, and that lead to the version v3.2b which is the latest current version.

Please note that, as i always did, i kept the original behaviour as the DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR in the latest indi.

That is so everyone can keep using the same settings yet loading the latest indi.

Every improvement I make are considered as "options", so if you want to use them, you need to alter the corresponding settings from their default values. They are disabled by default.

In short: you can use the latest v3.2b version safely, and use it to trade either option, Mer's initial strategy being its default behaviour.

You can explore Johnny's suggestions by setting the appropriate options accordingly.

As Johnny stated, and i fully agree with that -- and that's actually the reason i encouraged him to post his ideas and keep posting them while Mer was "out-of-the-office" -- the whole purpose of the additional releases of the indi and the EA are to explore these new ideas and find profitable refinements.

The EA, although still not yet taking advantage of the same additional options, namely the "StickBoxOusideSRlevels" option of the v3.2b indi, is also a tool to explore these variations in an automated way, allowing backtesting against historical data, which is very important, although not giving any guarantee that the performance will remain the same in the future.

I am preparing a new release of the EA (v1.3), that will have this additinal option, so it will be in line with the indicator v3.2b.

It will also have several improvements with some fixes, such as making sure that remaining open trades SL are correctly moved to the previous TP level when a trade closes (ie T2 and T3 SL are moved to TP1 when T1 closes, even if price did not exactly reach TP1 due to spread, and same with T3 for TP2).

Other improvements are also on the way, like the GMT offset issue -- thanks to xmph for that too -- and also an option to move SL to BE when price has reached a fraction of the TP (2/3 was proposed, but that will simply be another Factor-or-Pipcount input, to make it most flexible).

I have quite a few items in my list.

I know i've been silent lately... and you have all been waiting for these improvements for quite a few days now... but i also have my priorities

I'll do my best!

Is there a profitable way to trade this just using one trade and just aiming for TP1?

The martingale multipliers and three trades is too much for me to manage.  I'm more of a one trade win or lose guy.

In the tests he lets the trades go TP or SL for the first trade out of three.  Would it be safe to say that many of those first trades would at least go to some profit even though they didn't hit tp 1?  (Maybe then allowing to lock in some small profit or breakeven?)

Looking at the past few days of EU, it looks like that losers were because it was in a range.

I'm thinking that if I just analyze a pair and determine trend, rangebound or consolodation I could determine the most appropriate TP for a single one trade entry.

That is, if there is an obvious range, and TP 1 is outside that, either dont take the trade if range is too close or make tp what might be the range bounce.

Another thing I noticed by looking at some charts is that durning london hours there can be a false breakout then durning the US/london overlap you get a better breakout that makes it to TP 1 before SL................... Which would work fine for me because I don't get up until a bit before the US open.

Anyway........ Does anyone use this method without martingale and just trading one trade per pair???

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Kumo,

That's pretty much how exactly how I was trading for a while, just using the TP1 and one trade per long/short. I would re-enter a trade if the price went through the "buffer zone" of the box. No Martingale for me, either. I found that I was getting stopped out a lot, and didn't really have a great way to recoup losses. on average I was getting about 300-500 pips a month per pair, which was fine based on my MM. I've switched up my basic strategy now to create

10-20 pip box, and using all tiers. This has been way better at saving earnings for me!

Squalou,

I'm exited to hear about the changes coming to the EA! In the future will it be possible to make T3 a stop point once it's been crossed, and the actual TP point say, 30 pips beyond it?

Thanks again for the tools to make some serious pips!

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi Sqaulou

Thanks for all your work with the EA.

I was wondering if it would be possible to put an option in there to just open one trade only and then just take profit at TP1.

I only test on a small live account and have a goal of 30 pips per day.

Hopefully you can add this to your long list of updates

Thanks again

This is already the case.

Set TP3Factor=0 will use only Trade #1/TP1.

Post #485 where the EA v1.2b was posted has the full release history.

You can also read the comments within the EA source code.

extern double     TP3Factor    = 2.618;      // if >=10, this will be taken as  FIXED PIPs rather than a factor of the box size; if 0, Trades 2&3 will NOT be sent (only Trade 1);

Cool, right ?

@ Squalou:

It is time I came out of the woods to say how much I admire your ideas and coding skills.  I have followed you on the Steve Hopwood threads with great relish, but as a junior member was not able to comment or contribute.  I am a FF newbie, but not a new trader as I explained when using Steve's newbie thread on Epsilon Megastar to try to praise you both at this post:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...3&postcount=92

Then I found you on this thread and became excited about this work, so I concentrated on learning it.  I was previously excited about your

modification of Steve's Super Signal EA and suggested improvements that you could use to make it much better.  I hope you will put your SS EA on the back burner for a new thread.  Here is the post:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...1&postcount=93

But what Mer, you and Johnny have done in this thread is amazing.  I am sad that there has been so much bickering, http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gifbut I am really excited about

your EA version 1.3 that will give us the option of using the 3b indi.  I have checked out your 3b tpl on several currencies and the results are stunning.  I think this potentially is the best EA I have ever seen for consistency and reward/risk.

I was going to suggest using the Super Signal indi for direction changes, and/or the Trade Signals with SMA6 filter that you and Steve Hopwood developed.  Frankly, the super signal indi seems to be the fastest for determining direction changes, but there are problems with it as I explained in the above post.  Nevertheless, I look forward to testing version 1.3 as soon as you post it.  Version 1.2b has worked very well with default values, over 10% gain in one week using mini lots in a 10k demo account.  There are losses that I believe Johnny's ideas will eliminate most of them.

I plan to contribute results when I can, but I do consulting work and will be out of the net traveling overseas soon.  I look forward continued success in this thread.

Excuse me, I'm new in this thread and I have a question about times. You wrote that box times are from 05:00 to 08:00 GMT but default value for StartTime, EndTime and SessionEndTime in 3 Tier London Breakout V.3.1.mq4 file are different:

StartTime    = "06:00"

EndTime      = "09:14"

SessionEndTime= "04:30"

What time should I use when my broker is in GMT +1 + additional 1 hour for DST time zone? Thank you very much in advance for your answer.

Hi Pete,

thanks for the congrats, i apreciate.

I must admit i haven't followed-up with the SS-EA thread lately, and kind of jumped out of it several weeks ago... NNB and LBO work had taken over.

Pardon me for not having noticed your posts there...

Thanks for your suggestions, i shall see how i can manage them.

I will PM Steve to ask that he adds you to his "buddy list" so you can post in his threads

I still have the SS EA improvements in my backpack, silently waiting for my return... i have made some interesting coding on the "auto-optimiser"

feature that i wanted to add to the SS EA, however not gone all the way to having it completely debugged yet, but it is in a promissing state.

I'll get this done some day.

I also let Steve carry on the NNB EA, and it has now developped pretty well, and new excellent coders have joined the thread (maxou, phover, ...)

I just can't do everything at the same time.

I don't know how Steve can get so many EAs posted -- well, yes, we all know how he does: he must have found a way to exploit Einstein's relativity principles: his biological clock displays 48 hours a day  ...

Scoobs has also been a very nice source of "pro traders insight" information indeed, i love his posts!

Hi guys,

Could you tell me if this part of EA is working by default or I need to activate it or there is a problem? If it is a second option how I can activate it?

//buy(sell) on Buy(Sell)Entry crossup(down);

//Strategy suggests to re-enter only once a (M15) candle closes inside the box.

This is the dafault.

EA will re-enter based on M15 PA;

EA v1.3 will have an option to specify the timeframe for re-entry, so you can re-enter if M5 or even M1 bars close inside the box instead of M15 bars.

Squalou:

Thanks for putting me on Steve's threads.  I look forward to contributing to his threads, as well as to yours and Johnny's if he, as I hope, opens a new thread with his ideas.  I think that the super signal indi could help with his system to establish multiple boxes during the trading day.

I know it is impossible to do everything you would like to do in forex and agree with you on Steve Hopwood's amazing work.  I also don't know how he does it.  At some point I would like to see you open a thread to develop further the SS EA.  I really would like to help with that work as well.

Last night I adjusted the parameters in EA 1.2b to use Johnny's method of trading Mer's strategy, but it did not work well.  the 10 pip box allowed too many multiple entries that led to multiple small losses.  I think a 20 pip box would work better, but I did check these trades on a separate chart with the 3b template and there would not have been any losses.  I am eagerly awaiting testing your forthcoming EA 1.3 with the options you have identified.  It should be a real winner.

Having said all of this.  I will be completely out of the net for 3 weeks starting next Wednesday.  My wife just retired from her career and we are going on a celebration vacation in Europe,http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif flight to Venice, a cruise to the Greek Isles, then 3 days each in Florence and Venice before flying back to the states.

It's really up to you. You can close them if you wish but it is best to leave them until the current series runs it's course because if you have a reversal then the other set of pending orders may get hit since you already have them in place.

I second that. Although the thread has been a bit slow the last several days, I'm sure most of us are still checking for updates, and for the next release of the ea. I still feel this is one of the very few profitable systems (and best indicator) out there, and am having success with live trading. I have also experimented with many different possibilities for a "filter" to improve entries, but so far, have not found any indicator or other method that works. Yes, you can filter out bad entries, but so far, anything I have tried also filters out good trades as well, and the net outcome does not end up being any better (and sometimes worse) than no filter. I do still use my personal revisions of a 1 pip buffer before entry and break even stop at roughly 2/3 the distance to TP1. Those modifications work well for me, in addition to my personally preferred box times. I'm sure I will still keep trying out new things, though (that's just my nature)

Hi Mer good news about the new improved EA that is coming I was wondering if you could incorporate trailing SL as many pips are left on the table during big moves.  I use TP1 only and a single position opened thanks for all you are doing on this thread

I have been trading this live for just over a week now and have been doing reasonably well.  However my performance could drastically be improved if I could rule out the times when a pair ranges from top to bottom of the box triggering trades and SL's, I have tried a few ways to spot this and rule it out but I haven't achieved the best way of doing it, has anyone found an approach to reducing this?

Hi Johnny,

I had followed this thread for a few weeks now.  I saw you came up with some interesting ideas.  I am using indi version 3.2b and my setting are as follow:

MinBoxSizeInPips = 20

MaxBoxSizeInPips = 20

LimitBoxToMaxSize = true

StickBoxToLatestExtreme=true

StickBoxOutsideSRlevels=true

With the regular breakout strategy I understand that I will go long when candle breaks through upper box and short when break through bottom of box.  But with these three options set to true, can you elaborate how you would enter a trade? Please view attachment for charts.  Thank you!

NightOwl

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I have looked at this for the last few days and I can definately see how this works:

Less trades - which is good

Less whipsaw between top and bottom of box - which is great

More respectful of pivots and other points of support/resistance

However there is no option for enabling this in the EA so it has to be manually traded which leaves human decision in the mix and I miss several good setups per day.

Thanks for the advice and I will try to improve my entry technique

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Just a further update to this I have entered four trades today based on 3.2b indy and had 3 winners and one loser.  Today I am +76 pips and very happy.  I am currently playing with the code of the EA to adapt it to trade the same way as the 3.2b indy.

Lysian

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Dear Lysian,

Can you tell how you determine entry point using 3.2b? When you enter sell or buy if there is no break out ? Look at above question form NightOwl76 ( post 770 ) and his screens.

Regards,

RL

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hi RL

In my opinion entering trades using a manual system is a matter of judgement.  I look at the trend of the pair and I will also have the pivot points on the charts to give you more clues. I don't personally trade any breakout unless a candle has closed inside the box, please look at attached chart that shows a recent EURUSD movement, recently they have been in uptrend and the pivot points show that the pair are coming off support at around 6am GMT (Europe open), in this case you could have entered long as the upper line of the box is broken.  However I prefer to see a candle close inside the box and then I enter long as they break out of the box and therefore I did not enter.

So I think the long winded answer to your question is I would not have traded any of the examples in NightOwls message as no candles closed in the boxes.  If you cover six or seven pairs with this system there are many trade opportunities and its best to pick one or two good ones rather than trade every possible one and lose.

I hope this helps

Lysian

Hi RL

Attached is the chart of GBPUSD from today.  I have taken 5 trades on this pair and 4 have been winners today.  Trade three was a long that reversed and was stopped however it ended up as a winner short.  I dont know why the system entered trade 5 short but it did just after I applied the modified EA to work the same as indy version 3.2b.

Lysian

--- 帖子 #776 ---
NightOwl,

The first thing you need on your chart is something that will show price exhaustion such as Linear Regression Channel and/or Bollinger Band. The price reverses sometime before or after the LO a high percentage of the time. The big question is when and how can we see it.

The second thing we need is an indicator to show confirmation of the reversal. Stochastics, Moving average cross or a Gann indicator will do the trick.

Understand we are looking for direction and not trend although the LRC and Bols will give that as well.

Happy trading,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Lysian,

Whether the price reverses at the edge of the box or within the box is irrelevant to the success of the reversal as shown in your chart. Your example only shows the need for a better method to trade it.

Trade well and prosper,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Lysian,

The box placement is based on time which is a hit and miss as far as hitting major Support and Resistance. After the initial trade the box is quite worthless unless it sits at a major SR. Waiting for the price to move back to it just waste pips.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Lysian,

My SL would have been placed above the last high shown on your chart. As the PA moved down from the high I would move the SL just above the SR points shown on your chart but never very close thus averting a SL hit. Confidence in the trade will make you pips but until that happens you will get these SL hits.

I just read this again. Why a Long on #3?

I come back to check the line “ SendTrades “ to make sure it
changed to TRUE. However, it is still in FALSE mode
I repeated the process many times but it is still in FALSE mode http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif

What happens & how to solve it ?

Thanks alottt

Hi L,

There is no no need to click save on the inputs tabs of the EA just change the send trades to true and click OK and this should work

Hope this helps

* Hi Lysian & All,

I DID try Not Click On SAVE . I only click on OK, then it prompts me to
small Alert window with words:

LB EA: EURUSA ...... INITIALIZED.....

I click on OK, then appears on the upper left of the chart such words:

Trade Comment = 3 tier London Break out

Local Time,2020.10.01 Broker time 2010.10.01..... Bar time.....

Buy Entry 1.36660, TP 1.37040, ST 1.36280

Sell Entry 1.36280, TP 1.35900, SL 1.36660
Trading hours 9:15...
Moving to BE+1 pips when reached TP1
Martingale Not USED
V1.2b+++++TRADING++++++

However, the EA does not trade automatically . Nothing happens!

Do I miss somethings or Did I do something wrong ?

By the way! When coming back to check the line " SendTrades ",
I still see it set to " FALSE ", not TRUE ( I did changed from False to TRUE) http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif

Hi L,

From what you have written everything seems to be fine but I'm confused as why you don't get trades.  All I can suggest is that you delete the EA from your experts folder and then download another copy from this thread.  Remember not to save on the inputs tab only press ok and, hopefully, this will work

Hi

I have read this thread and I am interested to try this in my demo account

Actually I find two threads by Mer , which one should I follow , and which is the best Pls help me to get started

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Thanks, Lysian.  I deleted the EA and downloaded another copy as you suggested. But the problem has not solved yet. I cannot run the EA

Anyone can help me, please !

Thanks in advance

Hi L,

What broker do you use?  Do they alow micro lots?  By default the EA sets up lot size of 0.01 - maybe the broker only allows 0.1 and above?  Its all I can think of as the readout you get in the top left of the screen appears to be correct

Lysian

--- 帖子 #791 ---
At attempt to send the order there is an error (invalid function parameter value 4051).... What can it mean help who knows?

--- 帖子 #792 ---
My broker is FXDD . It allows micro lots, so 0.01 is OK

Broker Time:  GM+2 ( Start from 5PM EST )

I cannot change :

1) " Sendtrades " from  False to True

2) Start time from 6:00 to 8:00

Conclusion: I cannot change anything in Input Tab

I use 2 computers and download the EA to them .

Both computers have same problem. I do not know WHY.

Hello everybody in here, in order to continue with problems as to the installation of the ea .... I just cannot drag the EA from out of the navigator into the chart! Can anybody tell me, what's the problem?

I tried to fix the parameters in the Editor but I do not have the rights to do so, is that true?

thx!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
this is not EA it is an indicator

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Is there a way to tell the EA NOT to do this, and just let all trades run?

--- 帖子 #797 ---
You can set the parameter BreakEvenProfitInPips=0

[when >0, will move SL to BE+BreakEvenProfitInPips when price has reached BE+BreakEvenPips]

in this case EA will not move SL, or you can set it to 15 pip or more and this allows you to have more profit in case price will not reach second or third targets.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
how can we set the EA to trade just 1 micro lot and close it @ first target

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Dear Mer and Squalou,

First of all I would like to thank you for that really excellent job which you have made. I saw many trading systems, but your LBO is one of the best (possible the best that I ever seen). Special thanks to Squalou for perfectly made EA.

I have made many tests and had come to a conclusion, that System shows the best results on GU.

Now I am using EA on GU with the following settings (not all shown):

MinBoxSizeInPips = 25; MaxBoxSizeInPips = 40;

LimitBoxToMaxSize = true; StickBoxToLatestExtreme = false;

TP1Factor = 35.00; TP3Factor = 100.00

AutoMartingale = true; ResetMartAtFirstProfit = false;

brokerIsECN = true

(25-40 / 35-100 is not very profitable, but with the lowest DD, but if capital allows it’s better to use 25-55 / 35-125 or 25-60 / 40-110 …)

Before the important news, brokers usually increase the stop's levels (mine, for example, usually up to 30p), very often the edge of box breaking exactly at this time, so if the TP or SL is less than 30p, an error message returned and order is not accepted. So I set the parameter brokerIsECN = true, for the same reason I have  to set the level of TP more than 30p.

As to EA, I have a kindly request to Squalou: whether probably in new version of EA to add option LimitBoxToMinSize, similar to option LimitBoxToMaxSize:
"//when true, a box smaller than MinBoxSizeInPips will be limited to MinBoxSizeInPips".

It would allow to test system at small boxes. Besides, sometimes on small boxes, the price can make considerable movements. Well, for example today (Oct., 8) on USDCHF the size of box was 17p, however the price has passed nearby 65p from edge box. So if  we EA can limit box from 17p to (for example) to 30p, we can reach two targets – 30p and 54p.

Thanks in advance, hope my request is not onerous task. Also hope, it will allow to improve profitability of systems.

With the best regards,

Konstantin.

Set the Lot  = 0.01 and  TP3Factor    = 0

--- 帖子 #801 ---
tank you brother!

another Question

how can we set EA not to trade again when it come back to and close in the box? i mean just one buy pos and one sell pos. and if they closed in profit or not it doesnt open a new in same direction after closing in box

--- 帖子 #802 ---
I may suggest you to try to set parameter "MaxTradesAllowedPerSession=1", by default it set on 0 that means no limit on trades, if you set on 1, there will be only one trade per session.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
This is an interesting point as I would like the facility to finish trading after the first win.  The martingale can take care of losses but I would like the option to stop trading the pair after first win

Thanks

Hello everyone,

i know i have been silent here these past weeks, and you were waiting for a new version of the EA for so long...

Your patience is now rewarded: here is

EA version v1.3.

It has the following improvements and changes:

- Option to trade 5 TP levels instead of 3:

- added "TP5Factor"; when set to 0, Trades 4 & 5 are NOT used;

- Added "MoveToBEFactor: move to BE when price has covered at least this ratio of TP1;

.     - default is 1: move to BE when hit TP1;

.     - any value >=1 will be taken as a fixed pip count instead of a factor of TP1;

.     - examples:

.         - with 0.66: it will move to BE at 2/3 of TP1;

.         - with 10: it will move to BE after having covered 10 pips;

- when martingale is used: if trades are still open from the previous session, then open new trades with the PREVIOUS (lower) martingale multiplier instead of the same multiplier;

- Added "MaxWinsAllowedPerSession" input;

- Added "TFforReentry" input: 15(=M15) is the default, but can be changed to 1(M1) or 5(M5) to re-enter on shorter TF;

- Added "Debug" input (more Print() when true)

- fixed(hopefully!) "trade 2&3 not moving to BE when TP1 is hit";

I hope most of you will find what they were waiting for...

Thanks so much for your hard work and new EA!

Trying to test it out. I was getting "unmatched data errors" so I deleted and re-downloaded all the history, but am still getting the same error. That's when I start the testing at 1/1/2009.

When I start the test at 9/1/2010, I get a "zero divide" error.  Any ideas??

thanks!

Squalou,

To save you the time of checking the "zero divide", if that's the same bug as in the previous code, check in  Inserted Code void compute_LB_Indi_LEVELS(datetime now)
it happens that sometimes  Inserted Code boxExtent
could be equal to zero.

I did not yet investigate the reason when this happen, but adding the following will at least allow everyone to enjoy SQ's code:
Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void compute_LB_Indi_LEVELS(datetime now)
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
{
int boxStartShift,boxEndShift;

if (now >= tSessionStart && now <= tSessionEnd) return; // box already up-to-date, no need to recompute

//determine box and session times
tBoxStart = StrToTime(TimeToStr(now,TIME_DATE) + " "  + StartTime);
tBoxEnd   = StrToTime(TimeToStr(now,TIME_DATE) + " "  + EndTime);

if (tBoxStart > tBoxEnd) tBoxStart -= 86400; // midnight wrap fix
if (now < tBoxEnd) { // consider the last PAST box
tBoxStart -= 86400;
tBoxEnd   -= 86400;
while ((TimeDayOfWeek(tBoxStart)==0 || TimeDayOfWeek(tBoxStart)==6)
&& (TimeDayOfWeek(tBoxEnd)==0 || TimeDayOfWeek(tBoxEnd)==6) ) {
// box on saturday or sunday: move back 24hours again
tBoxStart -= 86400;
tBoxEnd   -= 86400;
}
}

tSessionStart = tBoxEnd;
tSessionEnd = StrToTime(TimeToStr(tSessionStart,TIME_DATE) + " "  + SessionEndTime);

if (tSessionStart > tSessionEnd) tSessionEnd = tSessionEnd + 86400; // midnight wrap fix
// save the computed session start&end times to avoid recomputing them for each handled trade;
tLastComputedSessionStart = tSessionStart;
tLastComputedSessionEnd   = tSessionEnd;

//determine hi/lo
boxStartShift = iBarShift(NULL,0,tBoxStart);
boxEndShift   = iBarShift(NULL,0,tBoxEnd);
boxHigh = High[iHighest(NULL,0,MODE_HIGH,(boxStartShift-boxEndShift+1),boxEndShift)];
boxLow  = Low[iLowest(NULL,0,MODE_LOW,(boxStartShift-boxEndShift+1),boxEndShift)];
boxMedianPrice = (boxHigh+boxLow)/2;
//apply LevelsResizeFactor
boxExtent = (boxHigh - boxLow) * LevelsResizeFactor;

if (boxExtent == 0) return;

[.....] leave the rest AS-IS

Thank you so much for this brilliant EA squalou. I have been hoping for an EA with this fliexibility. I've been experimenting which a LOBO that NeoRio is developing and with this EA I can use it for multiple chart entries when the action gets crazy. Thanks again,

Do you have a description of the various adjustments available. I'm not sure about "stickboxtolatestextreme" . I was hoping this might hault all trades for the session if the maxboxsize is exceeded. Is there an option for this?

Thanks again for this HUGE project

Thanks xmph for the remark.

Note to all of you who are having the "zero divide" error: please note that the EA is supposed to be running in M15 or lower TF charts (M1 or M5).

It uses the chart's candles to determine the box start<>end times, and so if it used on H1 or H4 charts, it may go into that error.

However, I have no clue yet why we would get a boxExtent of 0, as this is supposed to be the difference between the highest and lowest price within the box time.

Even if the EA is run on a TF where there would only be 1 candle in the box, then this candle would not be 0 pip high...

Unless there is missing history data.

Try to refresh your charts data (right-click on chart, then select "Refresh").

Then remove+reload the EA.

I can't think of any other reason.

Attached is v1.3a with the work-around proposed by xmph.

(i just added the test on boxExtent, but kept all other code, as i made some slight changes in this area).

how we can solve this problem that EA works with bid line when wants to buy

look at picture bid line didnt reach to entry buy but a long position opened and got stoploss

--- 帖子 #816 ---
The EA uses Ask for Buy and Bid for Sell.

CHARTS BARS however are drawn out Bid price only.

Look at the last bar in your chart: you have the Bid and Ask lines, and the bar current Close price is on the Bid line.

In your example, Ask DID touch the BuyEntry price, so it did correctly enter Buy.

Unfortunate that price reversed right at that time

SQ

--- 帖子 #817 ---
regards

tanx for answer...but my question.. is it possible for EA to trade with Bid line when it wants to open a long position?

u know touching entrybuy line by ASK line is not our goal u see break out happens just when BID line touchs the entry buy NOT ask line and this is FALSE signal...

this would be worse when i try to trade in some chart like XAUUSD(gold spot) or even GBPJPY cause they have 4-7 spread! a lot of bad trades those shouldnt open!

tanx in advance

--- 帖子 #820 ---
This is a point I wanted to raise earlier.  The EA should have provision to take into account spread, for both entries and exits.  In the meantime, the current work around is for you to adjust the factors for box size and stop loss.  Bear in mind the margin will be more pronounced in bigger boxes, but I suppose it's not a bad thing.

the EA still closes any open trades from other systems or manual, despite different magic numbers.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
GREAT SPOT sabooky!!!

Many thanks for that!

Another pair of eyes is always better...

I should perhaps get a bigger screen

This bug shows up only on 2/4-digits brokrs, that why i couln't see it (i use a 5D brokr), and why it would not affect everyone.

So... attached is v1.3b of the EA with this fix.

SQ

--- 帖子 #823 ---
The EA is not closing any trades at all, it only changes the SL values of its own open trades, using the 3(or 5) consecutive magic numbers that are generated from

I can't see why it would close other trades.

Can you post a extract of trade/account history showing the EA changing the SL values for trades that it is not responsible for ?

Or even closing any trades ?

This would show up in the trade history as changing the SL of a trade that does not have the "3 Tier London Breakout" trade comment in it, to a SL value that is one of the LBO TP levels (or BE level).

Perhaps you're running SteveHopwood's MPTM EA on another chart somewhere ?

SQ

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Interesting.

This would give you some kind of small "buffer" on opening.

What you suggest is wait for Bid to cross the BuyEntry line, and buy at Ask price (you never buy at Bid: you would either get rejected if slippage is lower than spread, or get filled at Ask anyway).

Reverse for Sell.

Note that if we were using buystop/sellstop orders, as we did in LBO V1, you would enter just like now, when Ask reaches BuyEntry, not Bid (for buystop, reverse for sellstop).

Someone had mentionned adding a "buffer" input for entry levels ("EnterBufferPips"?).

Perhaps we can just do that ?

How about exits ?

The EA sets the TP and SL to the exact TP/SL levels.

Use the buffer also here ?

Or a separate "ExitBufferPips" ?

?

SQ

--- 帖子 #825 ---
"EnterBufferPips" nice idea brother....of course for both enter and exit

--- 帖子 #826 ---
For example, say the Box is 1.5000 to 1.5050.  Spread on E/U is 1.5 pips.

The EA should do three things at this stage:

1.  give an option to add X (eg. 1) pips to the box limits.

2.  add a further 1.5 pip to account for spread for long entries.  For short entries it doesn't matter.  (EDIT: Stop loss should be set at the same level as pending order as per usual.  This means stops would also be at least +1 outside the box limits)

3.  send pending orders to the broker as soon as the box closes.  (eg. 3 pending shorts at 1.4999, 3 pending buys at 1.50525).  Right now, the EA sends trades only when the spot price hits the box limits....if spot price is rallying hard all three trades end up in different places.  This is really bad because for example you can't set the box to trade NFP, instead you will get filled at the extreme of a spike.  If orders are sent to the broker ahead of time, say at 10:29 prior to NFP, you are guaranteed a fill at roughly the current levels.

Another issue relating to the spread, is when you go short and TP1 hits -- price can often retrace to BE and then rally short to TP3 again.  Mostly you won't get a chance to go for this second rally to TP3 because your ASK already triggered the stop loss at BE level.  For longs I think it matters less.  One current work-around for this is to use the SL factor and set it to something like 0.89.

Cheers,

Chngster

--- 帖子 #827 ---
That is what I did when I got the really great results with manual testing.  I would buy at Ask + spread + 1 (buffer), so that visually on the chart, the bid line would go 1 pip above the box.  I would sell at bid - 1 (bid line would go 1 pip just below box.  Take profit for a buy would be at the 1st TP level, take profit for a sell would be at the 1st TP level minus spread (again, visually the bid line would just hit the level).  The 1 pip buffer (combined with taking spread into account) did help to filter out some bad trades and made it more of a "breakout" instead of just ranging within the limits of the box. Having a larger buffer didn't seem to help, but I was only able to test one pair with one set of settings, since it was all manual and took the whole weekend to do.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
nice one.... i`ve traded like that before using EA i think we can consider it as an option in EA dear Squalou

--- 帖子 #829 ---
When I spotted the error, also present in the previous versions, I realized that High = Low, and thus High-Low = BoxExtent = 0. That error appeared on a M15 (I only apply SQ's EA to M15). So it was not High=Low=0, but High=Low.

This might be related to poor data, simply some very specific scenarios when High = Low .... I may spend a little more time and check if I can add a little more info on this.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
I'm liking this EA a lot. Thanks for sharing.  It is a pitty that the EA has to enter multiple trades so that it can scale out profits. This gives up around 10 pip or so for each "trade". To get around this for now I'm going to forward test the EA alongside MYFX which my broker kindly supplies. MYFX can be set up to manage scaling out up to 4 TP settings. I'll use 3 TP's

I'll set up the EA on two accounts. The 1st account which I'll place orders in will have the EA set with only the TP1 and this will be set with the TP3factor. On the second account I'll run an identical setup but have the the EA running with my mormal settings. As this secound account produces the TP values, I'll enter these manually into MYFX which is linked to the first account. Hopefully this is all clear. The requirement of course is that I am present just before LO. My back testing shows that the profitablity falls off by 50% if TP3 is the only TP used. Backtesting is here or there I know. But here goes.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hi squalou,

after the initial setup for the EA - if I change the settings for TP, these are not indicated afterwards. This happens in all EA's (1.2b, 1.3b)

the reason for it could be the following line?!:

PHP Code  if (tBoxEnd <= now && now < tBoxEnd+86400) return;

mtbf40

--- 帖子 #832 ---
The last 2 london opens produced losses for my setup. Looking back over results a good percentage of losses can be reduced by halting entries if the point of entry has exceed say ... 75% of the average range of the day (in the direction of the movement that is). Yesterday for example the EA entered after the GU had already moved up 100 pips.  The average daily range at the time is 135 pips so the probabilty of extensions is smaller.  There's my two cents worth. Anything that helps this profitable approach improve. For the time being I will manually experiment with this rule. Thanks again everyone.

You are probably ECN and probably did not activate the ECN option.

SQ's work is to be trusted based on my live trading experience, and based on the code analysis of the code he provides you for free.

Think twice next time you are writing something like this.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Or maybe your trading window is to short ... although first trades were off, you would have caught long revesal and making excellent profit if using a martingale.

Point of my comment .... there are yet no perfect way to trade the system, Version 2 improved over version 1. There are yet other versions to be cooked.

i didnt mean that EA doesnt work good or didnt mean disrespection brother i just say sometimes EA forget to replace SLs ok? take it easy brother i like squalou and he is respectable for me a lot any way im sorry and apologize if u think i spoke bad ok?

PS : my ECN broker is True

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Were the other trades we can see in your picture also opened by the EA ?

They are on different pairs (not USDCAD), and they do have TP+SL set.

xmph is quite right when he asks you to check ECN input: when launching the EA multiple times on different pairs, it's easy to miss one of the inputs...

The best is to use presets for each pair so you won't forget anything and the EA will always be setup with the correct inputs (provided that you are loading the correct preset file for the given pair... that bloop also happens...).

It may also happen that the SL is set too close to the open price, and can be rejected by the server if so; this depends on the brokerz.

However, in this case i doubt it, because the SL should be at 24 pips if the SLFactor input is 1. Can you check this input too?

Have a look at the journal log, see if there were any rejected OrderModifies, it usually is error 131 "invalid stops" in this case.

The other thing is: where is the 5th sell ? the EA will only open either 1,3 or 5 trades, not 2 or 4...

It is important to understand what caused this problem.

You can always use smaller lots for each trades.

Instead of having 1 trade of 0.5 lot for instance, and scaling it out at each TP level, you use 5 trades of 0.1 lot each, and you'll achieve the same result, including cost: when 5 trades cost you 5*0.1*spread, 1 trade of 5 times the size will also cost you 1*0.5*spread.

You'll have to give away your 10 "pips" no matter how you do...

Squalou,

Hey there! Great works as always. Ran into something during trading I want to run by you. This didnt happen during backtest, (EDIT: It does happen in backtest, I didn't catch it because I didn't look at the detailed results, just the report) so I have to assume it is either due to spread or possible the box is extended to 1.2 (60 pips) but the orders may be trigering at MaxBox of 50 pips top/bottom. Somewhere in there. ..maybe. IMHO.

Last night EURJPY opened and did the following...

Kind regards

today every thing is OK but 3 bugs.. i say it... maybe usful....

in EURUSD EA opend 4 Position as u see in the picture there is no tp on Target2

in XAUUSD there is no replacing SLs although TP1 was hitted
in UCAD no TP no SL at all
I know the reason it is through broker but why EA stops trying?

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Thanks Squalou -You are absolutely right. 5 trades at .1 lots each is the same as 1 trade at .5 lots. Ooops! This will save a lot of extra mucking around. Ea is working a treat so far.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Squalou and everyone else,

Please disregard my previous post about BE not moving correctly. It was my mistake, I was using a previous setfile that was doing "something" to the EA. When I reset the setfile, the BE seems to move correctly. Sometimes it does appear to move BEFORE TP1 is hit. I will be doing more testing and let you know if issues arise. But as far as the last one, please disregard. I apologize for any confusion this caused.

The EJ hit all my 5 TP levels last night

Settings for EJ TP1factor - 1.0, TP3 - 2.2, TP5 - 3.2, SLfactor - 0.8

I have the EA on 4 pairs, EJ, AU, GU, EU. My demo account down 2.5% since Thursday. My backtesting show lower probability when allowing the EA to trade Mondays. Did take big hit this past Monday - around 5%.

Excellent EA, many thanks!!

I want to use it on various times throughout the day.

Initially for the Asian session, a one hour range around 0100 broker time, then a hour at 0600 for London and a third at 1400 for the NY open.

Can I do this with only one 'profile' and three EAs?

Any answers? Please don't worry about the actual times they are just there to guide you as to my needs.

Any help would be much appreciated!!

Today's overnight trade lost me 95 pips, won 20 but the second trade made a success of the day. Only demo, testing the EA.

Stop Loss works well!

You must run the EA on 3 different charts to have 3 different sets of inputs (3 different box sessions).

You can only attach 1 EA per open chart.

Hi,

I am using the EA on three time boxes and seems to work well (asia, london, U.S.). I was wondering if it is possible to assign different position sizes to each open trade when not using martingale strategy.

Thanks

Charly,

tu peux me côser en francais directement ici, ce sera plus simple.

Tu ne dois pas pouvoir m'envoyer un PM pour le moment (pas assez de posts), donc poste ici et je te repondrai.

Je t'ai mis dans ma "buddy list", je ne sais pas si ca t'autorise à envoyer des PM ou non... on verra bien.

Sorry guys, there will be very few posts in french until Charly can PM me...

Hello squalou,

Here is something that I find very useful on my chart. It has a market open and close indicator depicted by vertical lines and then I added 10 pip high boxes showing the full range of all major sessions in different colors. I did this using the 3b version and erasing all unnecessary code and each session is it's own indicator. I set the Max and Min Pips to 10 and all others to True. The value of this indicator is you see the PA reversing at about the same time every day. Knowing when a session is about to end alerts to possible reverses.

Nice work on the EA.

Cheers,

Johnny

How can we say to EA to act that : open 5 positions and close 3 at first target and break even then close 1 at second target and close 1 at second target...

please help me need it sooon tanck you in advance

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Hello Johnny,

Would you be so kind as to share that indicator?

Regards

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hello Dave,

I don't know if this will work with the version used here. I'll have to look at it when I get some free time.

Maybe squalou or xmph our two coding geniuses could incorporate this into the latest version. The bar currently doesn't show on the chart until the session has ended. The ultimate would be that the bar shows on the chart at the start of the session and grows as time passes until the end of the session. It would also be advantageous to have the London, US and Asian Opens on the existing indicator or at least incorporated into the same indicator instead of three separate indicators.

Attached is the indicator I use to produce the vertical lines. You will have to adjust for your chart's time zone. On the inputs you will need to change the color from black to linen.

The EA does a fine job but price often does not play ball!!!

Is it possible to add a safety net of say 5pips, back from the box edge so that if price pops out, triggers orders then retraces back into the box, the trades are closed when price loses 5 pips on the trades.

This would limit my losses to 25 per instance and still let the EA make more trades when price pops out again.

Since I know nothing about EA programming, this might be a nonesence but the alternative is to manually close the trades. Would manually closing interfere with the running of the EA?

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Thanks Johnny.

Day one of my multiple pairs/ multiple breakout trials.

The Asian Run as I call it was first to go and we had a spike.

€$ made 5 buys to TPs or SLs on the way back;

£$ didn't trigger as I had the min size too big but then made lots of 5 trades that just bounced up and down. Wish I had that safety net!!!

I tried manually closing the trades to save a few pips. Later I added a 'move SL by mouse' on another chard- same pair. It worked on the chart but the 3T just ignored it, in fact didn't use its own SL values;

$Y didn't trigger at all!! Don't know why. Looked in log, looked in journal but no answers.

Ah well, LBO next, see how that goes.

Hi friends,

That´s a really good strategy.  I´m applying it and it is working very well.

I would like to ask you, why the EA is not placing the trades.

I´m attaching the image with the error:

Thank you for your help.

We don't get a lot of posts these days so ...

At a guess, I would say you have an ECN broker but have not ticked the box. Worth a check.

I couldn't upload this ea to mt4 (demo account). I was try on different brokers - the same situation. Anybody know what does it mean?

--- 帖子 #870 ---
I'm on Alpari,if that helps.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
it doesn't help

--- 帖子 #872 ---
When you say you can't upload the EA are you saying it doesn't appear in the navigator bar under expert advisors? Just check you have pasted it into the correct experts directory for your demo mt4. sounds obvious but I once had two demo mt4 packages loaded on my hard drive. I once happily cutting and pasting indicators into the dirctory of the wrong mt4 version I was trading with. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #873 ---
I have 6-7 mt4 platforms on my pc for different strategies. A simple london breakout EA have a right folder (expert). In mt4 it already compiled and it has a right color (not gray). But when i try to upload it on the chart - nothing happens. I was trying it on different brokers - the same situation. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Only the normal suggestions. Delete it and close MT4. Re install. Maybe even download it again but I'm clutching at straws here.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Please modify  London Breakout  indicator with an alert when price goes buy-sell zone.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
That would be kinda helpful when away from computer. If I could add a further addition for the wish list - email alert for the same thing. I use my cell phone to alert me of the major alerts from my most significant indicators via email = 2 5 EMA cross-over and the TDI crosses. THANKS wonderful programers

--- 帖子 #877 ---
I started the test today, got the 3 TP in 1 session with the EA.

I don't know why the EA is not profitable in back test but in forward test it is profitable, maybe some data is missing in the backtest.

Anyway I never trust in backtests.

Excellent EA.

Hello!

I was trading some weeks ago with this system with a live account.

My account did not opened all three operations in the 5th multiplier, the mt4 said me not enough money.

I traded 2 pairs at once with 1,000 live account with 0.01 lots, it wasn´t enough money to trade at multiplier of 5.

To use this system, you need to have at least 5,000 to trade 0.01 lots with some pairs.

I hope that this information help you.

Thank you .

--- 帖子 #879 ---
I told everyone a long time ago that you need to have a well capitalized account for this EA to be successful in the long run. To run 2 pairs on a $1000 live account is a very irresponsible move without properly forward testing it out on demo.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
I have a demo account on Forex.com with a MT4 platform and thought I'd try this EA now that it seems a lot of the bugs have been worked out. It loads fine and then is immediately removed when I change send trades to true. Any ideas why? Any help would be appreciated. I don't use MT4 to trade live nor have I ever used it to run an EA.

Well it now seems to be working. It was doing the zero divide thingie. After a few input changes it now seems to be working.

Thanks,

Johnny

--- 帖子 #881 ---
More like impossible.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
wainer,

Do the math there isn't any weakness in the system. This is a very good system but it only makes a profit after you fund your account, not before. You are trading one full lot and a grand isn't going to cut it. Demo first and learn the Forex basics.

Johnny

--- 帖子 #883 ---
That's true mer07, I didn't read your recommendations.

I'm just stating my personal experience. I have not lost money, but I have gained much from this system and do not even need to spend much time on the computer. This system has a very fundamental principle, taking advantage of the breaks of consolidations.  I'm not trading with the EA, it is not working for me. I'm placing Stops orders manually. If somebody can help me with the EA would be appreciated.

Have a good day!

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Agreed.

Although I modified things here and there, the minimal account size should be 2500$ ... No way you can use LBO at a lower balance.

That is also only true for using the Mart sequence of Sq, none of the fib-like ones which are too agressive for such a small account size.

Hello.

When loading the EA's I get an error with the lots, asking me Lots >= 0.1.

Why happen this and how I can fix it?

Thanks.

PS: I use "3 Tier London Breakout EA, v1.3b", by Squalou

--- 帖子 #886 ---
I am having no trouble so is the problem with the "0.1."? are you using .1. or is the 'dot' after '1' a full stop ie end of sentence or a misplaced (.)?

Otherwise try starting again, re-load!

Dear all, here are 2 bug fixes I found trading live the EA V2.0.

Bug1: Accounting for slippage, closing at TP1 may not trigger the MOVE to BE+ due to slippage and thus not enough pips_to_lock. Here are a fix to make sure that each time a TP is hit, then the rest will be moved to BE+

Reproducing the Bug: (that was a tricky one you could only spot trading live ...but that you may enjoy reproducing manipulating this (add the following in bold)

in void CheckForOpen()
Inserted Code if ( (iClose(NULL,PERIOD_M15,1) >= SellEntry && Bid <= SellEntry[size=4][b]-Slippage*pip[/b][/size] &&
Bid >= SellEntry-[size=4][b]2*[/b][/size]Slippage*pip)  Fix1:
Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void MoveSLwhenProfit(int profit_pips_target, int pips_to_lock)
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
{
//Lock-in some profit after a minimum profit target is reached:
double SL; [size=4][b]double Slip;

[/b][b]    if (OrderType() == OP_BUY) {Slip = MathAbs(OrderOpenPrice() - BuyEntry);}
else if (OrderType() == OP_SELL) {Slip = MathAbs(OrderOpenPrice() - SellEntry);}[/b][/size]

if ( (OrderType() == OP_BUY  && OrderClosePrice()-OrderOpenPrice() >= profit_pips_target*pip[size=3][b] [size=4]- Slip[/size][/b][/size])
|| (OrderType() == OP_SELL && OrderOpenPrice()-OrderClosePrice() >= profit_pips_target*pip [size=4][b]- Slip[/b][/size])
) {
if (OrderType() == OP_BUY)  SL = NormalizeDouble(OrderOpenPrice() + (pips_to_lock*pip)[size=4][b]+Slip[/b][/size], Digits);
if (OrderType() == OP_SELL) SL = NormalizeDouble(OrderOpenPrice() - (pips_to_lock*pip)[size=4][b]-Slip[/b][/size], Digits);
if (MathAbs(SL-OrderStopLoss())>Point) { // ?!? surprisingly, "if (SL != OrderStopLoss()) ..." won't work... even when both seem to have the same value (using Print())
_Alert(" #"+OrderTicket()+" ("+OrderMagicNumber()+") moving to BE+"+pips_to_lock+"pips");
_OrderModify(OrderTicket(), OrderOpenPrice(), SL, OrderTakeProfit(), OrderExpiration(), Green);
}
}
}  BUG2: If there was a trade still open from a previous session, then even if we were in a scenario of MaxBox was reached, there was still 3 orders to be open if triggered although no order should be open.
Fix2:

In void Start() main function make sure you recompute the indi-params after ManageOrder() has been called. It was a little after in my version thus screwing the all logic ... eventually this one was due to me modifying too much of SQ codes and introducing that bug. Dunno.

Inserted Code // manage open trades even when outside trading hours;
// however, we won't open new trades
GetAggregatePosition();
if (TradesOpen > 0) {
//-----------------------
ManageOpenTrades();
//-----------------------
}
[size=4][b]compute_LB_Indi_LEVELS(TimeCurrent());[/b][/size]
Hope this help some of you trading this Live.

If you have no clue what these modifications are, my advice is to not use EAs and trade manually.

SQ if these were already addressed in your V3, sorry.

X.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Actually, this is not supposed to be a bug. The EA is supposed to open new trades even if there are open trades from the previous days session. It is supposed to open the new trades at the same multiplier as the current open trades. The latest EA sqaulou posted had a change where the new trades would open at the previous multiplier, but that is not executing correctly and he is working on a fix.

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Of course, the dot is the final of the phrase.

I´m  trying it with 0.01 lots in a standar account, as the EA is programmed, and I get a message: error, Lots must be >= 0.1

Thanks and excuse my English.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Nothing wrong with the English. My training is to look for simple explanations hence the dot question.

Next simplest explanation is that your broker does not accept 0.01 lots.

That is all I can offer I am not a programmer. I have run this EA on .01 lots but now use .1 - it is easier to see the $ values. On demo for the moment but expect to go live in a week or two.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Thank for your helpfull.

My broker works normally with 0.01 lots, but not with this EA.

Somebody can I help me?

--- 帖子 #892 ---
If you go live with .1 lots, how much do you plan on funding your account with? Even if you only get up to level 6 (which is a multiplier of 89) and get stopped out you'll have placed a total 14.4 lots x 3 trades= 43.2 lots already. Remember, some brokers limit the total lots per trade to 100.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Hello Mer,

eventually I explained that one poorly.

So the Bug was related to having orders open although "max box size is reached" and SetMaxBoxSize=false, in a scenario where current BoxSize exceeds MaxBoxSize BUT at least one order is still running from a previous session.

The reason for the bug was that recomputing the LB_Indi was performed too late (not just after manage trade), and as such the MaxBoxSize was that of the previous session as altered by the ManageOpenTrades() (instead of using the current MaxBox that would be too high, thus preventing trading).

I believe that is a Bug. Eventually I'm not correct as this is Friday ;-)

HTH

Take care.

Hi Guys,

I stumble upon this thread and got really interested in this strategy but I'm really a newbie in all the EA thingys and all the indicators.

I would like to just do it manually, can anyone explain to me how does this strategy work if I were to do it manually?

Hello Gensys, try to stumble on Post 1, and read from there. You'll see, everything is explained, detailled, and illustrated for manual trading. EA came afterward.

Hi All you programmer experts!!!

Does anyone know how to alter the SL from the far side of the range box to something closer?

I would be obliged for any help.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
This may not be what you are asking but you can alter the relative size of the SL related to the range box by adjusting the SL factor.  Change it to 0.5 to make it half and so forth. If you are asking about altering it after the trades are taken (selecting and dragging the SL and TP lines) this wont help the concept behind using EA's ... as I see it. I have a few EA's that I run in tandem  that is both on demo and Live. The results are that my demo has increase by 4X and my live is break ever over 4 months. The reason - I interfer. My opinion ... you need to set the EA up based on some backtesting and fwd testing experience (that's the hard part) them let them run. I don't have the balls for it yet -results speak loud. So set up this breakout EA and build some confidence then go live and have a go at getting the head in place. If you are like me when the SL is approaching and if you are panicing you have to much on the trade. Enough said eh!

You could try this EA if you wnat to have a moveable SL and TP for maual trading

I had to fiddle around a bit but found that it works a treat. It is set up for 4 digit feeds. So 100 StopLoss is 10 pips. DEMO it first. You'll love it. Click and drag ya TP and SL. Good for manual breakout stategy. Caution - if you have it on a currency pair it will effect any other condition of the same pair on multiple charts. Happy trading hope. this helps

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Thanks for that rivet. I have altered the element where the price hits TP1 and sets up a 1 pip SL.

It now makes a -5 pip SL after reaching 10% of the range so that it does not just run back and cost me 5 times the range.

In addition to that it ensures that when the trades are closed, price has re-entered the range box so will trigger more trades.

What I would like to do is simply make the initial SL 5 pips instead of the range.

I do not want to interfere with the range size in relation to the TPs.

Tried to use a move SL by mouse. The aparant move was successful but the new SLs were not triggered. Price just sailed by!!

Squalou:

After a long absence, an exhilarating European vacation and afterwards some trying times, I am finally back. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif I really do appreciate the work that

you're doing in this thread, and the others you are participating in.  Just wanted to let you know that I am demoing this EA, as well as exploring

the other work you are doing in the Vegas thread.  When you have the time, check the post I made in the Vegas thread.  The changes that Pinhead has made to this EA are very close to the suggestions I gave you regarding your super signal EA.  With an improved super signal indie applied to the pinhead EA, I think we would have a real winner.  But this discussion needs to go on at the Vegas thread.  I do have some feedback for you from my demo results of the LBO EA in my next post.

Pete

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Squalou, and Mer:

I have attached chart showing what seems to be a problem with the entries of your latest version 1.3 b.  The latest version is making both buy and sell entries without regard to the last box.  On this chart the buy and sell trades are clearly above the entry points identified by the last box.  Maybe I am missing something, but I wanted to bring this anomaly to your attention.  Also, this version does not provide the option to stick the box outside the SR levels, as does the version 3.2b LBO indi.  Are you going to provide the ability to trade with entries, determined by the box outside the SR levels in your next version?  I hope so, and I also suggest that you include a user option to extend the box a certain number of pips above or below the extreme point set by the box. Looking at the charts I think this addition would help in initiating more trades.

Pete

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Just a follow up rivet.

Had the opposite experience to you. I had the demo blow my account with its ability to cost 5 x range.

It is the occasions when price passes the range by a small amount and triggers trades that then retreats, that I am trying to reduce..

I will try using a smaller percentage for price to achieve before making the -5 SL.  This will hopefully reduce the number of times when that this situation occurs.

Using the 10% model today I incurred 2 x 25 losses but saved myself a 22 x5 loss so 60 pips to the good.

Thanks for the Easy, I may well try using it with just the indicator instead of the 3T EA

Anybody can help or tell me what I am doing wrong ?

Thanks

Bert

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Hi Bert,

I don't have any real idea about the malfunction but if it says invalid stops it might be the stops are too close to the trade price.

It might be that your broker is ECN and you have not put the input in correctly for ECN. Just my guess!!

I am using this EA with no problems.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Phreddy

IBFX

Is IBFX ECN ????

I don't think so..

Thanks

BTW can go give me settings about SL Factor

(TP 30 Sl 1 = dont work ! Then?)

Bert

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Bert:

Some else had the same problem with IBFX on another thread.  Changing the ECN input to true solved the problem.  Try it and see what happens.  These crims are pretty sneaky with their setups.

Pete

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Hi Bert, you are using the 'set number of pips' option with a fixed range (30) and TP1 (30), TP2 (60) as I understand it.

! am using the 'range from xx:00 hrs to yy:00 hrs' and a factor of '1' so if the range is 15 pips then TP1 is 15, TP2 is 30 etc.

Does this explain it? There is a document explaining the settings in post 1 I believe, or use the 'paperclip' at the head of the page.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Thanks Phreddy will study your post.

As Pete suggest previously in the meantime I turn on ECN for IBFX and it works !!!!

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Well... where are all the guys of this thread (Mer, Squalou...)? Another thread ? Another system ?

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Most of the activity ended a month ago approximately.

I am using the EA but it keeps popping out, triggering trades then retracing and crossing the range making 5 x range losses.

Ihave asked for the ability to make the SL 5 pips but no reply. Tried PMs too.

I monitor the thread in case of an answer but I think that it is a dead thread

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Hi Phreddy

At least we are two !

Shame all gone coz this ea has a good potential...

Perhaps creators found holy grail and holy settings and they absolutly don't want to share...

BTW Ea seems to work... and I finished the days near par.

From your experience  do you think  it is better to do one shot of 3 trades or leave ea do multiples trades ?

E/U G/U and G/Yen are positive, E/CHF big looser (PA went north and went back south)

Nothing on U/CH, U/Y and E/Y : less 25 pips = no trade

Have a good WE

Bert

--- 帖子 #915 ---
I have followed this thread with interest and i have the ea on demo. The key to trading the EA is not trying to adjust the parameters because you are just trying to curve fit the EA for now but may not be appropriate for the future. The key to trading the EA profitably is to understand that the EA works well on trending pairs. So  what i usually do is look at the 4 hr and daily charts to see which pairs are trending, I do this  on a weekly basis. For example you can do no wrong if you traded the EA on eurusd and aud usd through last month. It was a harvest of pips. The EA goes on my EA live Account from next week

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Mer went on to another project, squalou is all over FF often with R.Raygun.

EA does its job, I was using it on London BO and an afternoon session. BUT, as I said, it needs watching, it comes out, goes back in.

If I could get the 5 pip stop loss on it I would be happy to leave it to its own devices.

Okehiedon may well have the answer. Wait for the trend to be established.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
686 pips since yesterday night... not bad...

I will reduce Lot ( by half of 0.1)

And you Phreddy ?

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Bert, I think that you French people do not understand the expression 'not bad'!!!

686 pips is excellent!!  Congratulations!!

I am playing with the 'easy' EA to position my stop loss and the 3t indicator for guidance.

Cannot get a proper hold on it so today I am trying to use the 3t EA and closing trades that retrace.

Forgot to turn on the 'EA action' button for trading when I did I got two indicator pictures. One at 12 the other at 25.

I will try the afternoon trades.

By the way, I am told that the thread is dead because the project is finished. It is now up to us to work with it.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Hi Phreddy

Even French i really know what is such amount of pips in only one days ! Especially after 5 years in Fx and one beautiful MC that left me stoned for nearly 6 months !!!!!

For to day the harvest have been good : 206 pips. no float all closed.

On my stats, only G/U is really bad making 50 % loss.

On winner side E/Y and G/Y are terrific making 75 % profits

Alpari UK GMT+1 all cur set 06:00 09:14 TP 30 Sl 20 others sets OOTB

Perhaps have I to change entry time and exit for G/U moving 1 one hour back(05:00/08:14)

What do you think about ?

Entry time is key : I put London BO two days ago on another laptop with the same settings same cur BUT on FXDD Malta GMT +2 : the results are baaaaaaads

See you

Bert

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Yes Bert, the start time is often a problem. Sometimes the BO is immediate other times there is an amount of indecision with buys triggered and lost then sells triggered and lost.

I had to give up yesterday, the EA went wrong.

GU is not good these days so perhaps it is time to dump GU and only use the yen pairs.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hi Phreddy,

Yes Entry times...

Same problem on Phoenix EA 4 years ago...

I thinks (huuuummmm!!!!) that you should never start an EA whatever the time. You have to be very cautious :  Monday afternoon, Wednesday afternoon, slowly...

Btw to day have been a strange day

On Alpary (the turbo one) London BO went back for -325 pips (GB)then recover to +177 pips at the end of the day

On IBFX +573 pips... No comments !

This EA is really amazing : don't know so few people are not on...

Perhaps they want :

a / to loose money

b/ they like complicated things,

c/ there are sado-masochist and love to be hurt...

Perhaps the 3 options together ???!!!!!

At the same time I test others EA : I am on Blessing : nothing extraordinary, (one days heaven, the other : hell !) FMT payed version nothing extraordinary, IndoRun a bit better but so many options and CBBP : a raw and guts EA... starting... lets see

The only EA with REAL results is London BO V2 !

Well to morrow is another days and I don't know since yesterday how to change GB/US entry time

See you

Bert

Ammar

London BO set is GMT : then is your broker is GMT + 2, you have to add +2 for entry and end

Let me know your settings now.

Why ? Because you have to understand very well the time notion in Fx market. And at the time you understand this notion one time...

many thanks for ur advise .. this is the chart

--- 帖子 #926 ---
...if FXPro shows chart time as GMT+2, then you need to set the indicator range times to 07:00 and 09:45, assuming you want the 5am-8am London range, and you're using a 15min timeframe chart.

Hope this helps.

Hi, I really need help here. I leave in SIngapore.. So, some one can help and please tell me what is the SIngapore timing to trade for the London Break out? From what time to what time to trade and look out for the blue box in SIngapore time? And please tell me what is the minimum of pips for the box to be a valid set up? Thanks & cheers..

--- 帖子 #929 ---
The whole idea of the London or any breakout is to take a time/range as your breakout base.

You will see that 3t uses a long overnight time. I use two hours before London opens.

So, look at your chart and mark where London opens compare that with your computer clock or your own watch. Decide what time you will use.

I am using 0700 - 0759 on my chart. This is UK time 0600 - 0659.

On Friday this gave me a nine pip range and I made 15 x 9 pips (in demo). My real time is 1400. I am in Malaysia.

The important thing is for you to sort it out for yourself not take anyone else's times or ranges. There is no 'correct' answer.

Hope that this helps.

Hi Phreddy

You are still there: good...

Well Fiday has been a BAD day = some losses... Normal.

There are always bad days and we have to accept it.

Then after one week of "normal" trading (the week before had been an "adjusting" week) we have a +25 % on Alpari UK account  and only a +5 % on IBFX

The thing is that I made a mistake on this Alpari account : I put straigh on the EA on the charts of Alpari 2 weeks ago with London time set and.... Alpari is GMT +1

And its works ! Better than IBFX GMT 0 with OOTB settings

=???!!!!!

Strange isn't it

Then on Alpari GMT +1 Entry time : 06:00 End time : 09:14

Always GB/US = bad... give me an idea ! 05:00/08:14 ?

On other hand all JPY/curs are still good. EU/US weak

Have a good WE

Hi Bert,

Friday was good for me on £$. Came straight out and up to 6, 15, 24, 33 and I moved the SL to take 27 on the last one.

I like this EA but it is not to be trusted...No, price is not to be trusted it pops out and back as I have said.

Having said that we do get a breakout morning and afternoon but I need to watch it. Trouble is I get bored. I am retired, have a reasonable income and don't need more. So, low motivation to trade.

Now I have the answer: I watch films or TV series on a small part of the screen with the chart beneath it. When price mis-behaves I intervene manually. Like the last trade above.

The afternoon would have been good as well but the trade window kept coming back 'busy'. I would have closed all the trades for about 45 pips each.

FXDD I wouldn't trust it to go live in case the same thing happens.

Just thought, FXDD is UK + 2 so my times are an hour out.

I keep telling people, "The actual time is not important, just around London Open"

Hi,

i only find the mq4. and i cant put it on my chart (V.3.2b)

Has anybody a idea?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Make sure the file is in your  metatrader/experts folder

Shut down your metatrader platform and reopen it, this will then compile the mq4 into ex4. You will be able to drag it onto your chart then

Thanks.

Now i have a mq4 and ex4 in my expert folder. But in the journal the MT4 say: V.3.2b is an indicator and cannot be execcuted.

The 3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3b works fine

--- 帖子 #935 ---
If your running the EA then you dont need the indicator, it is built in to the EA, so just remove it from your indicator list..

Hi, guys! Thanks a huge for the EA.

Will smbd tell me what is the last EA - final to the moment?

I had downloaded ver. 1.3b and I have some objections to it. Ist of all this method supposed to disable trading in some days when price range is less than the defined minimum and greater than the maximum. Am I wrong?

The IInd one links to order reversal in case of bouncing. In EA this does not happen at all. Shall we use it or disable manually, it would be usefull even for backtesting.

To the author of the strategy, - Mer. I would introduce a filter to avoid false breakouts, for example Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed applied to 4H. We will trade only long in case of blue candles and only short in case of red. For manual trading it would a great improvement, I suppose.

Thank You for Your time reading this mes.

Hello everyone!

I was trying to use EA posted in this thread. However I'v spotted few disadvantages during working that EA. Could anyone please answer my questions:Does EA open only pending orders? Is there possibility to open orders by market price? For example it is hard to place pending order 3 pips from open level (not every broker allows that). Don't know why, but function "MaxRisk" doesn't work for me. I put MinLot size 0.2 and MaxRisk 5%. EA opens orders with 0.2 lot. I know I have larger account so that 5% risk would be much bigger. Does anyone know how to solve that problem? Have anyone had such problem (I couldn't found that on this forum)? If someone could answer my questions, I would really appreciate.

Regards and all the best for all of you forex fellow traders!

Excellent day yesterday on both sets.... Indeed excellent.

Excellent BAD day to day on both sets... Indeed...

The worst is : candle break level of two of three pips = 3 orders opened...

PA retrace...

SL hited...

PA continue his way and break the other level of two of three pips = 3 orders opened... Good...

and PA RETRACE !!!

and SL hited...

Grrrrrr

Cool down : its FX !

Jacenty : for the moment :

a/ no pending orders as I know. Only 3 direct trades

b/ don't go up 0.2 lots (only if you have a hudge account !)

I haven't try MaxRisk function

Perhaps Phreddy have some experience about

Hello guyz, i just need to ask this, if i am to start an acc with $2k would be alright to trade 5 pairs but only take profit on the 1st target point only or should i only trade one currency pair and follow the trend on all target points.

I'd love to hear someones opinion pls. thanks

--- 帖子 #940 ---
You will blow your acct before you say 'Jack', using the martingale function of this system with 5 pairs. Best advice check the dailies and see which currency is trending then  trade that pair. This is the best way to trade the EA. I personally prefer dollar based pairs. As I told a fellow trader " there are no bad EAs as such but bad traders".

On a general note never use an EA that you do not know what trading parameters it uses. That is why all this $99 EAs fail after sometime when the market condition changes and the trader does not know what went wrong based on his ignorance of the parameters of the EA.

Really glad to see some of you still posting on this thread, as I am convinced this is one of the best ways to trade the forex. Ive only been using this EA for a little while, but was wondering if the EA has a buffer built into it? Just to avoid some of the fake outs especialy on the Gbp pairs. Maybe I have missed it.

Thanks guys.

Crazy day !

- 56 pips one test coz a beautiful mistake I did : Unchecked Expert Advisors icon = red= NO trade... But a good mistake coz on the other test I got a -798 pips !!!! Fortunately a + 195 pips floating

Well same problem:  Touch Up/Touch Down levels = 2 SL !!! Bingo !!!!

I am really thinking of a 3 TU/TD Level for Guiness Book ! Who can do a 4 ???

Joking... but sometimes Fx is crazy !!!!

Always thinking about the TU/TD Levels problem

Ask creator to allow a "channel" of X pips after Levels before Enty ?

Possible way... coz if the level i right on a S or Resistance, PA will go one, 2 or 3 times in a day after breaking OR not breaking. And if PA runs backs we are another time in the TU/TD Levels problem until...

Well well,

Nothing like live trading ... today while filling orders 1-2-3 here is what happened:

OpenPrice3 < OpenPrice1 < OpenPrice2 With

OOP3<BuySL and BuySL<OOP1&OOP@ ... quite unexpected right !

Thus, considering the modification I proposed, Order3 got triggered @BE+ although TP1 was not hit (makes sense from the programatic point of view), thus leaving Order1-2 in quite a nonsense.

This is not a bug, it's actually an unhandled live experience.

For that reason, the only "fix" I could propose would be the following:

1. Fill the order as currently performed in the EA.

2. Set TP1, 2 and 3 as currently done.

3. Validate that OrderOpenPrice 1 < OOP2 < OOP3

3.a. if yes do nothing

3.b.1 if no reorganise orders accordingly if min (OOP1-2-3) > BuySL

3.b.2 if no & at least one OOP<BuySL, reorganise orders based on their respective OOP but most importantly adjust every TP based on the min(OOP1-2-3)

or simply readjust the TP based on the min(OOP)?

What do you guys think ? Do you think this should be modified/handlded so that we preserve the order 1-2-3 concepts, or should this be left as-is (not a problematic bug) ? (I did not loose money on that one, and actually, this would have potentially saved from hitting 3SL in a worst case scenario as Order3 could have closed at TP but Order1-2 hit SL ... OR ... this would/may still have cut TP3 profits short !)

X.

PS: that is only for long orders, same applies for short.

PPS: SQ, I hope you will come across that post. That may be some kind of issue that may affects other strategies we are developping.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Here is what I implemented in my code.

Week ends with some lost going back from 25 % profit to 22 % on Alpari account. On IBFX big mess : my fault...

On other hand market has been VERY crazy. Near holidays better to stop.

FOR A NICE AND HELPFUL CODER

(Or father's of this thread but seems they all went to Bahamas after earning HUDGE $$$$$$ !!!!!!)

Would you please "add" into  3 Tier London Breakout EA V1.3

(and if Creators allows it !)

a/ In user settings : "Channel" (or "Deviation" or Entryplus") in pips.

b/ In market order, Entry trade will be :

Level + "Channel"

Example : Cur XX/ZZ, Level at 1.2530, "Channel" : 8.  Long Entry price at 1.2538 , Short at 1.2522 short

(in London BO V4 the other thread and system there is this possibility to "adjust" the Entry trade level but no 3 trades at same time. I am testing now this EA)

This to avoid a bit the TU/TD problem : PA coming back to S/R

Thanks

Good WE

Could anyone please explain me precisely how does the MaxRisk work with this EA? I put LotSize 0.1 and MaxRisk 5% (just for my own use) and still my orders are opened with 0.1 Lot. Even that my account is much bigger... I don't understand that.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Don't know Jacenty.

Perhaps Phreddy knows and, as Creators/Gurus/Fathers of this EA are still fishing/fiestas in Bahamas, we are a bit blind.

Ideas : can you increase lots to 0.2, 0.3, 0.4.... ??? If so forget about Max Risk ! And increase manually your lots : yes I know not beautifull but... simple !

[quote=Holy pips;4255883]
Ok Holy. You can't stop the 3 trades at TP1

You can : or reduce LevelResizeFactor or reduce TP3Factor. (TP5Factor to 0)

Chose a cur, SendTrades to : false and play with these 2 settings and you will see where TP1,TP2 and TP 3 lines are.

Choose the settings that you like...

Be carefull that some brokers don't like scalping (less than 10 pips)

My 2 c

Bert

PS Other alternative is to go to thread A simple London Breakout in FF, download Indi + EA : they "play" together (same creators)

In this version of London Bo you can have an "Entry Channel" to avoid direct entry trade (very nice) and a stop at middle of TP.

It should be EXTREMELY INTERESTING in this version to have 2 trades at Entry : one can stop at middle, the other one at TP...

Another some nice coder ?????

So,if we wont to this ea works all the time we must leave our comp turned on all the time,with mt4 leaved open,right?

Is it posible to this ea works even if the comp an mt4 are closed,turned off?

Here is what happened for me...

at the end of trading time 3 positions with multiplier of 2 was steel opened

i closed mt4 turn comp off and went to sleep

next morning positions was closed with lost (sl was reached) and new positions didn't opened

why?what I'm doing wrong?

hey masterdeki, i think EA's only work with the computer on and not switshed off. That's why ur trades were not reopened

Hi Masterdeki

You must leave your PC rurned on if you want EA do his job...

That was my conclusion too :-) but I wanted to ask since I'm new in forex...

just comp on or mt4 must running too?

thanks

--- 帖子 #960 ---
No  the ea can't work ! But the prices are still running ! It is NOT because your turned off your computer that Fx world stop !

And at the moment as you turned on your computer, open your acount : throught your Internet connection you received 2 ton of quotations... with the consequence you had...

Look at closing time of your trades : it will be near the moment your opened your MT4 plateform

Perhaps somebody who knows better can give you other explanation, but it's mine point of view.

In the meantime  : good trading !

hi guys just a lil tot on EA, well from the lil i know i believe virtual servers are available for use for people who have to keep their EA's running on. I have once used a virtual server for a robot but the experience has given me phobia for any EA. So if u have to turn on your pc just Google for a good vps and pick ur best choice, and ur EA runs on but search for a good one then i guess i'll be seeing u@the bank after the brkout.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Have you read the book Jacenty? It should all be in the book.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
The creators are not off on their holidays, I often see Mer is looking at this thread.

What they are not doing is not answering silly questions for people who cannot be bothered to think for themselves, read the documentation or the thread.

Your answer above about Risk vs lot size shows that you thought about it and if it was your own problem you would have tried using one or the other and seeing how it worked.

I watch this thread because I am hoping that someone will come up with the answer of making a small SL instead of the whole range otherwise I wouldn't be here.

The EA is completed. It works on any chart that might have breakouts. One may use it as a simple 3 or 5 trade maker and manager or even a single trade. It can be used with three (I think) martingale options. To the best of my knowledge that is. BUT...people have to read about it not just put it on a chart and hope for the best.

I am anticipating going live with it next year, when the holidays are out of the way. I will also be babysitting it since it cannot think for its self.

I saw there is BO 80pips maximum! Can i know what does that mean? Am i right to say do not enter trade if the BO maximum occurs? And what are the best currencies? Do i have to enter immediately the buy/sell pending orders after 0900hrs? Or I have to wait the candle closed above or lower the pending orders? Please help and answer. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Yes,you are right,when the box is bigger then 80p you dont enter a trade.You dont need to place orders manualy because EA doing that automaticaly,just enter your setting for the EA and leave it running,that is all you should do.

Best currencies...I dont know,someone with bigger experience will tell you that,but I suppose that combination of 8 major currencies is the best.

I see you have similar problam as I have. The issue is that 'MaxRisk' option doesn't work. That's it. I don't know if anyone else uses this option to share their opinion, but I use it and it doesn't work for me.

Could anyone please tell us what to do with that? Is there any programming master?

--- 帖子 #978 ---
I just use lots so set to 0.1

I assume that you can apply 'max' or not.

I would have to read the book to find the answer.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
I read the book again, looks quite straight forward to me.

Copy the relevent piece onto a reply and tell me how you interpret it. We will discuss it here.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Quote from the book:

MaxRisk = 0;

Risk management:

MaxRisk is used only when not using the Martingale options;

It is the percentage of the account free margin that will be used to compute the size of the open orders depending on the stoploss level;

if MaxRisk is 0, then the size of open orders will be "Lot";

So,if you set AutoMartingale=true you can't use MaxRisk option

Is there any error in the journal?

--- 帖子 #981 ---
AutoMartingale is set FALSE. I've read that also. I've read everything in the book, and I cannot find solution for my problem. Have anyone from you tried already using MaxRisk option? Does it work well for you?

--- 帖子 #982 ---
For me everything working fine...don't know how to help you sorry

If you wish I can attach my EA settings

Maybe the problem is in broker

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Please attach your settings. Perhaps I haven't noticed some details. Perhaps it's broker. I don't know...

--- 帖子 #984 ---
it could be the broker i use 3 lots when it gets to target to it trails up to target 1 it oesnt exit for me as soon as it hits target 1 the first lot, if anyone can figure this out please post if its specific to my dealer alpari us if anyone can confirm please let me know...

happy new yr guys, and praying for more pips this yr

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Happy New Year 2011

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Happy New Year to everyone who is still viewing this thread. I wanted to stop in to let everyone know that I've adopted a few changes to the strategy regarding a different way to close out trades and how long to hold open trades.

I was a little concerned about losing pips on trades that would barely miss Target 1 and then eventually close for a loss the next day. What I've started doing is closing all trades at the "SessionEndTime", whether in profit or not. Now, we will obviously cut short some sequences that would have ran a little farther, but we have also made more pips where we normally wouldn't have and cut down on some of those losses on the reversals.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
What I is I visually divide the indicator into 2 zones:

Zone 1- The tan area between Target 1 and the opposite side of the box (which is our normal stop).

Zone 2- The green area between Target 1 and Target 5.

What I do is enter all trades like normal and let the price run it's  course until we get to the "SessionEndTime". You may have a sequence close before this time, which means we don't need to do any more unless a new sequence of trades are made before the session ends. Once we get to this point, 1  of 2 things will happen:

A- If price is in Zone 1, we close out any open trades, whether in profit or not. If in profit, we wait til the next day for new trades. If in a loss, we would increase our multiplier like normal.

B- If price is in Zone 2, we move the stops on all open trades to Target 1 and let the trade run its course until the next day's "SessionEndTime", where we close any remaining opens trade if there are any. During this time we will move our stops at each Target level as we normally would.

I'll show  a few examples.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
***Before I explain my example, I am using a 'Start Time" of 07:00, an "End Time" of 10:14, and a "SessionEndTime" of 00:30 in this example. I've also changed my TPFactor 1, 3, & 5 to 1.618, 3.618, and 5.472 respectively. I am also opening 5 trades per sequence using Go Markets if you would like to download their platform and follow along.***

A good example we had was on Tuesday, December 28th. We initially had short sequence reverse and stopped us out, then a long sequence which was stopped out, and then another new short sequence. Now if you are using the multipliers, we are now using a multiplier of 5 in this sequence. Now we wait for the 00:30 candle to close before we close our trades. As we can see, price never made it to our Target 1 at 1.53303. The candle closed at 1.53582 which gives us roughly +69 pips from our entry point. Instead of letting this sequence run as we would in the original strategy, we will now close all 5 trades at this time for +1725 pips (5 trades x 69 pips x a multiplier of 5). Take into account the -900 pips we lost in the first two sequences, we still ended up with +825 pips for the day. And if you look at the next day, we would've been stopped out again for a -1500 pip loss which means another increase in the multiplier again, increasing the risk.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
This next example, which happened the next day, is the same scenario except we actually have hit Target 1 first. In this case, we follow the same rules as the original strategy and we close out 1 trade for +79 pips and move all stops on the 4 remaining trades to BE +1. Again, as we reach our "SessionEndTime", price has closed within Zone 1 at 1.54843 giving us roughly +73 pips each giving us +371 pips for the day (1 trade @ +79 pips and 4 trades @ +73 pips).

--- 帖子 #991 ---
The next example is a little trickier as we have the price now closing within Zone 2 at our "SessionEndTime". We initially had a long entry reverse on us for a stop out of -250 pips (5 x  50 pips). Our new short sequence runs down to our Target 1 and we close out 1 trade for +160 pips (1 trade x +80 pips x a multiplier of 2). As we get to our "SessionEndTime", price has now closed @1.57660 which is within our Zone 2 (again, between Target 1 and Target 5). Now we move our stops to Target 1 and let the trade run. Looking at the chart, we never were stopped out and hit all of our remaining targets before the end of the next day's session ended. If you have any open trades when the next session begins, start any new sequences fresh with no multipliers.

We ended up with +1530 pips total (+890 pips x a multiplier of 2 minus our earlier -250 pip loss to start the session.

Not a problem, I've been so busy with other projects, not only with trading but also with our locksmith business, that I wanted to try and address the concerns people have had with opening and closing trades and to try and eliminate the larger drawdowns.

Mer, very interesting journal.  Thanks for all the analysis. I learn best with visual aids!. Best of luck in the new year, and hope to see a picture of your ferrari on here by years end, because you're making some serious pips my friend!.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
I still need to read the whole journal, but I have a question.

How did you make 160 pips on two lots, if you got stopped out for 5?..was your original short for 7 lots?..if not, where was the entry for those 2 lots that you covered for the 160?... hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Yes, it is probably best to read the whole thread first. I use a martingale sequence or "multiplier" when I incur a loss. When we had the reversal for the -250 pip loss to start the night (5 trades x 50 pips), we immediately enter 5 new trades multiplying the original lot size by 2. The multiplier's sequence I use is 1, 2, 5, 13, 34, 89, 233, 610, etc... If you take 160 pips x .01 lots or 80 pips x .02 lots, you get the same result. Because everyone may use different lot sizes to start with, I  multiply the pip total by the multiplier because it is uniform and  everyone can understand because it doesn't matter what your starting lot  size is, the 80 pips stays the same.

Now, in the example you're referring to, when we hit our first target of +80 pips, you must multiply that by the current multiplier you are using, which in this case is 2, and so we get +160 pips, see? There are several on FF that do not use the multipliers, and that is their choice, but I use it for all my examples.

Does any one that has been trading this system for at least a month or 2 have any result statistics they can share? Through backtesting it looks like a very good system, however I'm curious how it has actually performed. Thank you!

Hi Mer

Small problem

In your post 990 you attach a LBOEA version v3.1 and in first post of this so interesting thread the EA version is 3.2b = ????

I am testing also LBOV6.0 and the channel made between Level and Entry trade is one of the best thing to avoid multiple SL. In my test on 8 curs channel is between 8 and 14 pips.

My 2 c

NB As deep as I can see the pict of your post 990... (yes the same!)  if you had a 15 pips channel you should avoid at least one of the two SL. I posted before in this thread what I think (huuuuuum!) about.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Best thing to do is manually go back through the charts and see for yourself. I don't know of anyone using the EA live as of yet due to the large account size you'd need for safety. I did a quick visual backtest on Eur/Usd for the month of December 2010 and it would've made roughly  25,000+ pips (not including any spreads) and the highest multiplier I hit was 89 (.89 lots per trade if using .01 lots as your starting lot size).

This is the indicator, not the EA. I use this version because I didn't like the changes made in the later versions.

Can you post the indicator and maybe a pic to show us all what you're looking at?

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Sorry, whats "EA"? I read the first post and didnt see a definition of what it ment. thx.

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Hello Squalou,

thank you for your EA that i'm using with a demo account.

Could you please create another version of the EA with the 2 functions (TrailingStopPips and TrailingStopStep) activated ?

Thany you in advance for your support.

Best regards.

Really? You've been a member for over 2 1/2 years and you don't know what an EA is? Okay, by definition, an EA (Expert Advisor) is an automated program that  is used by the trading platform software (Metatrader4) to manage  positions and orders automatically.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
In attach pict of LBOV6.0

In 1/ no Entry in 2/ Entry trade

In 3 Tier it should be a real SL in 1/ and after a TP in 2/...

In 3Tier Trade is trigged directly at Level up or Level down of the Box

In LBO V6.0 the trade is trigered at Level + X pips depending of Entry Factor inside LBOV9.2 indi

I think (huuuum) that this "channel" should be a real plus for 3 Tier even if you loose X * 5 trades at the beggininng. But it's not a loss but a non profit...

Hope you understand my poor English...

I'm not quite understanding how you're drawing these blue bloxes for your entries...

"A good friend suggested that in may be due to the fact that I was starting too early (the first strategy had the box end at the Frankfurt open at 7:00 GMT) and that I should include that whole hour and start the box right at the London open because we were probably getting false spikes from the Frankfurt open. He also suggested that maybe try and use the old entry point as a target instead. I will have to give some credit to rjlacha as I then remembered he open a thread a while back and was using the edge of the box as his entry point and I thought that could possibly work. "

a/ Why not ? it's my choice...

b/ If PA is inside I am positive... in one glance

c/ Do you want it in red ? Green ? Violet ? Lavender ?

It's your choice...

That was the first post

But reading another time Big_pipin was asking me HOW I was drawing the blue box...

a/ My apologies Big_pipin... Sometimes when you "use"a language that's not yours you made mistake... It's my bad !

b/ to modify colors you go inside EA and....modify colors !

These pict come from the other thread about London Bo (Mer and Squalou) working with an indi (V9.2) and an EA (V6.0)

in your experience backtesting visual or otherwise in any pair what is the maximum mutiplier have you seen this system use. will try to do some homework myself to see how often they happen.

fantastic simple system thanks...

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
You set you start and End times in the indicator's parameters and the indicator will draw the boxes and levels for you. I hope that's what you're asking.

The max I've visually seen, before these last changes, was 1597 twice going back a full year (can't remember which pair it was though). With the new changes, I've not seen anything past 89 yet, but I'm still doing a lot of calculating at the moment.

I dont use metatrader, I use thinkorswim, and I'm on central time. I suppose that may cause an issue.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
I really don't why you'd be following this thread then because if you're not using MetaTrader you're just going to be spinning your wheels since all the indicators and EA's are coded specifically for MetaTrader and they really don't translate well to other platforms. ThinkorSwim is really not Forex friendly anyhow as it's geared more toward securities and options trading.

Hi Mer,

Thanks for the great discussions, if this question has been asked before I apologies in advance, what would you recommend as a SL point if we do not wish to use martingle or hedging.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
Well....so much for that i guess.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
If you're trading manually, you can use whatever size you desire. Some will use the opposite side of the box, like me, and some use a smaller stop like Bert505 and some others.

I'm really not trying to burst your bubble here, but I hate seeing people waste time and energy on a concept that they're not going to be able to follow and understand correctly. The threads here are for your benefit, but you must use the proper tools to be able to stay in the loop.

Developp yourselve tools for your plateform or change for a MT4 broker....

Btw to day have been a great day for LBO3Tier and LBOV6.0.... Great day around 900 pips in demo.... I know that will have bad days but for now it was a great day... Let's confirm all that in the near future

Mer one question : does EA move BE at each level in case of 5 trades

(when level 1 is reached 4 trades go BE +X pips, when level 2 is reached 3 trades go Level 1+x pips, when level 3 is reached 2 trades go level 2 + X pips and so on)

Thanks Mer, btw are you also coding the new changes to the EA?

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Yes, stops are moved for all open trades. But when you go through Target 2 and beyond there are no "+X pips" added, just to the exact price of the lower level.

I haven't had a response back from sqaulou regarding the info I sent him, so I hope he got it and is working on it. If I don't hear anything from him by the end of the week, I'll try and see where he's at. I know he is working on more than one thread so it may take a little time.

But for me it is too much : 5 trades + matinguale !!!!!

a/ My mono-neuronal brain will explode

b/ My heart too...

But always learning...

As I said yesterday we have good days and... bad days...

To day is a bad day !

But slowly recovering now (Btw stil in profit Hi! Hi !)

2 things : I have 3 demo account running with LBO the 2 versions

(to garbagge : Blessing, IndoRun, FMT, The Beast, Money Maker...)

* On one account Alpari this morning on EURCHF PA retrace and LBOV6 didn't close at SL In experts : Invalid price, err 129

Suggestion : when EA is to close a SL try 5 attemps at least to be sure to close the trade...

* On FXDD this morning 3TierLBO didn't put pending order on E/U= no trade (grrrr it was nice one!)

In experts : seems all ok and EA initialized

Suggestion : automatic "refresh"  of EA every X hours : suppression pending orders, reinitialization EA and new pending order.

Another day of profit...

Well not on all accounts

The EURCHF miss a -32 pips SL (cf previous post) and I closed it manually at -141 pips (32 pips box + 109) at the end of session...

(I left it intentionally to see where...)

As was saying Warren B. : "cut loss, cut loss, cut loss...'

Tomorrow is another day in the beautiful hell of Fx...

See you

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Bert,

Blessing should not go to "garbage". Eventually you will come to realize its hard to properly set as you have to understand every aspect of its 3000 permutation possibilities, or eventually you may slightly modify the MM but in the end you will come to realize it`s an excellent and profitable EA pertaining you are not trying to achieve 100% monthly ROI.

X.

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
With the new changes what account size would you require to trade up to the .89 level using a 1:500 leverage acct trading .01 lots, if you decide to stick to one or two pairs

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
3000 permutations possibilities... Huuuuummmm

Well ...good for you the next 5 years...

(testing 10 permutations a week = 300 weeks/52 weeks = 5 and half years)

As I posted before about the picts of Mer, i have only a mono-neuronal brain 3000 permutation is REALLY too much for me...

With no offense

Bert

PS IndoRun is also VERY interesting. Have you test it ?

Well tried to use it on  my live EA test Acct   but was getting a zero divide error.(Maybe because they use the old 4 digit price). My little experience  tells me that it works best on gbp crosses (eur crosses did not survive).Have run them on (gbp crosses) demo for 3 months. I set it to max 3 losses for the day, start time is one hour earlier to what you have, and session end  London close(figured if price does not move during london or US open then probabiilty at other times is slim).

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Another option would be to only trade 1 trade instead of 5.  Going thru the results that mer just posted for this week, you'd actually end up with more pips in most cases, just getting tp1 and out with 1 trade.

Still have to do the crazy multiplier, but you sure could afford to do it with 1 trade alot easier than with 5 trades

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Taz, I kinda disagree considering what makes the whole strategy working is the punctual TP2/TP3 hit when you are at a multiplier of 4x, 5x

This is confirmed by the poor Win/Loose Ratio of the strategy, BUT the high Profits in the end.

I will investigate Mer's new suggestion and will report if anyone is interested.

eventually, you may leverage the multitask/multithreaded brain of your new 64bits desktop ... and alter a little bit the Blessing code to allow such optimization ... and realise you need only one week ;-)

X.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Yeah, I am not sure about the long term benefits of just doing 1 trade instead of 5.  I do know that even if I had enough funds to trade this with 5 trades x 89 martingale sequence and take another stoploss, I'm not sure I'd want to

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
First off, I said I've only seen up to a multiplier of 89 so far in the few charts I've visually tested, but that's not to say it won't go farther up than that. I did a complete visual test from Jan. 1st 2010 to Dec. 31st 2010 on Eur/Usd and I did hit 610 a couple of times and 233 over a half a dozen times. But as we all know the Eur/Usd is always reliable and never consolidates for very long and is a very predictable pair.

Now for example, if you do 5 trades and if you get stopped out at 89, you'll have 7.2 total lots on the table just going to 89, that would then turn into 18.85 lots going to 233, 49.35 lots going to 610, etc... I personally recommend no less than $10K for every 1 lot you trade, but with the leverage you are trading at it would obviously be less, but more risky if not properly funded (not to say that it is not already).  And it also depends on what your broker's margin requirements are as well.

You could always run it on a mini account as well. IBFX for example, you can deposit any amount you want in a mini account and trade up to 50 lots per trade I believe. I actually calculated the whole year and the pair would have produced, and I'm not exaggerating this, over 452,000+ pips for the year. Now  this on a demo and is not taking into account spreads, gaps in history,  or slippage and re-quotes if you were on a live account, etc.. Now on a  standard account where .01 lots = .10 a pip, you would have made over  $45K+ just on this pair or $4,500+ on a mini account. What would it take  to safely trade this? I don't know, but I know even if you used a $200k  account you would have made over 22% on you money and any serious  trader knows that that is an exceptional annual return by any standards.

I always suggest testing out different variables to fit how you want to trade. Gbp crosses would benefit more from the London activity, but try not to limit your alternatives. Because price does not move much outside the big boys sessions is why I suggested to close all the trades at the "SessionEndTime" to prevent being on the wrong side of the movement after the Asian session starts. Sometimes it would work in you favor and sometimes not, that's part of the game and I'm not that greedy.

xmph hit it right on the head. Yes, you can just trade one trade, but to get the recuperative benefit of the strategy, you must trade more than 1 trade at a time. If you have several losses in a row and you suddenly hit a Target 2, you are guaranteed to recoup all the previous losses. Even at a Target 1 and the remaining trades stay enough above BE +1, you could still possibly recoup the losses too. I do sports betting during baseball season and I incorporate a similar sequence when betting there as well. I have an interesting PDF that was sent to me regarding Money Management for sports betting that also reiterates the benefit of martingale strategies, and it works!

Yep, and that is why I advised everyone at the beginning about the risk and the account sizes needed for this strategy to work.

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Mer,

thx for your great strategy! I have briefly tested with GBP/USD from March 08 to Dec 10 (start time 04AM - end time 10AM GMT), with only one TP1 of 60 pips, max 4x multiplier and have only seen 3 losses, probably 6x would've been enough to have 100% profitability. Other pairs were not that good. Even that, the amount of pips would be maybe not more than 6000/yr but some form of MM in addition to martingale I think can be applied (like a loose form of fixed ratio or increase big once right after a loss). This way one can start playing lots. I wonder if an indicator can help us (maybe Magictrend). Adding a 5 pips band could've helped too. One can also try to manage manually the trade once a 4x or bigger trade occur, using a tight SL...

I'm running it demo on eur/usd. In my setup price action didn't enter a trade yet.  What are you time settings?

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
Im trading manually.. I dont depend on EA cos i feels like im being lazy(pardon me) Im on EST -5

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
No ! No ! No !

It depends of YOUR BROKER TIME versus London openning

Winter time London = GMT

IBFX = GMT

Alpari UK = GMT +1

FXXD = GMT +2

Then according your broker time you have to adjust inside EA Start Time and and End Time.

On Alpari account

Start Time = 06:00

End Time = 08:44

Session End time : 19:00

To know your broker time draw vertical line and read time

Open Market watch and look at time in the upper line of the frame = broker time.The diffrence between the two time is the time you have to add or sbstract of the time of London openning

Sure inside this thread it is better explained

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
The problem is that im using FXCM as my broker with diff trading platform.. what i see is that they are on GMT -5.. Can u confirm for me? Im not sure if im doing it correctly..

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Salaam Mo

My IBFX account GMT =0

StartTime 05:00

End Time 07:44

End Session 19:00

Your are GMT -5

Then

Start Time 00:00

EndTime 02:44

EndSession 14:00

End Time can be also 08:14, then for you : 03:14

This is the only headacke setting in LBO system

Some others prefers 3000 permutations possibles : it's theirs choice !

Btw Xmph and to be honest (yes I can !) Blessing have a wonderful MM with PortionPC andMaxDDPercent to protect your equity account : that's a REAL plus.

Now with all the settings you have and you CAN have, this wonderfull EA is tooooooooo much complicated.

At one moment you loose focus : you are looking like mad for settings... and forget THE thing we are here : to make money. Point.

Last friday was a big whipsaw day. At least for my ea trading eur/usd. I won't ever trade the ea again on nonfarm payroll days.

And I do as well have difficulty in trading gbp, couldn't find any good settings. I only have traded gbp/usd. I didn't try different time settings though. Maybe you are right and do we do have to find other time settings for the box at gbp pairs. Or maybe cable is just too undelibirate.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
It is very time consuming to draw up every single trade that would have been placed, especially on 9 pairs. What I may do is report the total for the week for each pair, but you need to visual  to do some of the work yourself. I don't mind answering questions, but also I'm not a babysitter or here to hold anyone's hand, you gotta experiment on you own as well.

It all depends on how you use the strategy Bert. This was this last week on Gbp/Usd which made +5173 pips using the new rules in post #990 and closing all trades down at the market close on Friday.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
As Mer says, Bert ...depends how you use it.

I use the London Breakout ie about 8am UK time. It matters not whether you use the 2300 to 0800 or a couple of hours before the opening.

What is important and not catered for on the EA is the pop out and pop back across the range!!

I have practiced babysitting it and moving the SL to 5 pips when the BO occurs.

Look at Mer's chart above and take the basic values - no add ons with the Martingale, and you end up with 1200 or 1300 pips. Take off the red retraces at -25 pips a time and you lose about 150 or so.

I have asked for the provision of a 5 or 10 pip stoploss so that I can just throw the EA on my chart and leave it. Unfortunately no takers.

I was hoping to go live this week but my Internet has become unreliable.

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
It's already programmed in the ea to use an 11 pip or larger stoploss.

Well, to use a 5 or 10 pip stoploss, you 'll have to edit a single line in the code.

Find the next line in the mq4, (in the 3.1b version of the ea it's on line 602):

Inserted Code   if (SLFactor < 10) SL_pips = boxExtent*SLFactor/pip;
And then change it to

Inserted Code   if (SLFactor < 4) SL_pips = boxExtent*SLFactor/pip;
Then compile.

Now you can change SLFactor in the settings of the ea to 5 or whatever you like.

My first results in backtests with 5 pips stoploss are promising. However, I suspect in live trading a 5 pip stoploss might be too small.

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
That simple? ...thanks a lot. I must re-read the guide.

I don't mind an 11 pip SL just don't want the whole range!!

Time for bed right now but it will be first order of day for me in the morning - that is around midnight GMT so plenty of time to sort it out before London!!

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
Guys, making good profits with the LBO is not simple. Unlike what Bert and some other new guys may think, every aspect of the LBO will have a major impact on your results:

- MaxBox Size and MinBozSize will basically dictate how fast martingaling will happen

- BE+ at TP1 will determine when you are ready to cut short a trade and so eventually enter a whipsaw

- Time .... probably the most unlikely parameter you can find by hand. Bert, you don't like using computer programming for 3000 permutations .... how many will you go through unreliably by hand before finding the proper setting ?

- Not only time start and end, but also on what time frame

- Martingale sequence: how fast you can recoup and loose your account

These 4 parameters are only based on the original strategy and from my experience, these are all dependent on your very specific initial balance.

So, you're looking for quick bucks ... like everywhere else - no answer. You'll have to work the numbers for you specific case.

New parameters and variation have been added along the way and these can be beneficial ... but increase complexity.

Finally, if you ever consider using the BigDoG 5min confirmation (as I saw Bert you are also new on that BO strategy ... and it's a good thought), then complexity increase much, much further.

All in all, find the right balance for your account.

I'm up 70% since september 2010 with the LBO (and few custom modifications) for a max DD of 8% on a real account ... coz what matters is making $$ - that's eventually the only point I agree on with you Bert.

Keep Looking. Mer gave us everything we need ... and keeps doing it.

Thank you Mer.

X.

Hi Xpmh

Unfortunately I am not so new on BO...

I was on that last year ... well... in 2009 exactly in October 2009.

In attach file a small program I made in Excel at that time : open it, go in Properties, General index and look at the date of creation of the Excel Book : 04 October 2009... It is a macro to calculate entry levels sell and buy

With an indi at that time named ant-GUbreakout...

Well.. old time...

Hard to look at prices at midnight, put pending orders (sell and buy) on X curs, modify them in the morning... etc..

Guys here we are very lucky and I am also very lucky to have EA + Indi that do all that  stuff !!!!!

Btw I don't want here to start a nuclear fight of who have truth , who don't have... War always end by peace : then lets start by peace !

I will leave it like that and will publish my results good or bad whatever...

I'm requoting myself to insist on one aspect I believe is fundamental to be successfull with the LBO: Correctly using MaxBox and minBox sizes will dictate how fast martingaling will happen, but if carefully chosen, it will also dictate how often you may hit TP2 and TP3 at high enough martingale factors to actually make profit.

So, in a world of peace and respect, here is additionnal information:

- backtest the LBO without martingale over the desire period of time

- Use the desire Min/Max, or simply Max box size

- Apply the law of series to determine an approximate Win/Loose serie for the entire period

- Determine the max DD you are willing to suffer

- Fit the martingale on max DD + Serie function to maximize return at higher martingle factor

..... loop and check PAIR specific ADR during backtested period in order to improve on the MinBox and MaxBox sizes ... and perform again the previous steps.

This is one deterministic way to profitably use the LBO.

I see the LBO as a good strategy to handle the unpredictability of the market and make profit out-of it ... but including some simple stats background cannot hurt too much.

Hi everyone

First post on this thread but hopefully can contribute something useful.
I trade a very similar strategy to this but only GBP/USD. I use progressive staking as well.

Do not wish to change the excelllent content but would just mention three filters that have kept me out of many of those whipsaw days that can have you soiling your pants.

The first is not to trade on those days when there are no significant news releases for both the GBP and USD. Look back and you will see how often these days have below average ranges and many false breaks outs.

The second is not to take a trade unless a candle closes outside of the 'box' on the five minute chart. Many of the false breakouts are short 'spikes' that are probably stop hunts and 'sucker' breaks. No problem for me adopting this rule as I trade manually.

The third is never trade on the day of the non-farm payroll release. The market is always nervous ahead of this release and rarely makes a concerted move in the London session.

Nice strategy though and obviously profitable . Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Your choice Bert but you shouldn't allow people to push you off. I don't think that anyone means to!!

Savvez vous plantez les chouix ... That's the limit of my French!

Excellent advice especially concerning the 5 min time frame. Pin/upthrust bars are used to take out traders who buy/sell range breaks.

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
For first, do you know of a way to automate this? Backtesting news filter, and then news parser for specific words ? I think I heard of a website that actually post news rating but I can't remember where that is ?

For second, if you wait for a 5min to close, do you actually wait for a reverse confirmation on the 5min, or do you take any signal after that 5min closing ? I would agree with the reverse confirmation on 5min (that is also used by the BigDog thread at FF), I would not be too sure about the second option, specifically if the range is over that of BE+.

I will be coding the 5min confirmation soon on my LBO version and will let you know. I've been willing to include that 5min reversal/confirmatio concept for a long time to see its interest for the LBO .

im sorie but is there anybody kind enough to explain what it means?

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
My understanding of a 5Min retrace/confirmation scenario: (dirty illusrtation but it serves the purpose I guess)

1. Pull out a breakout box on a 15Min chart.

2. PA on 15Min is the trigger for the 5Min retrace/confirmation process

3. If PA Hit our trigger on 15Min, go on the 5Min

4. First step is to validate proce consolidate above our BO (complete 5Min bar close outside BO)

5. upon 4, wait for a complete retrace inside the BO on the 5Min

6. Once retrace is confirmed, use 5Min to enter the final trade upon BO

7. keep Monitoring on 15Min as usual.

In addition, it is said that the bottom of the 5Min retrace can be used as a new StopLoss (but then to what TP1 extent, that is the question eh eh ).

none of this is new. It has been used a lot in BO strategies. It is in my to-do (actually to-try) stack - but got a little lazy. I'm glad someone brought this up again.

Is this what others understood by the 5Min confirmation ?

Merc, May i know whether can a 10pip buffer added to the EA?

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Without modifying the code, what you can do is adjust LevelsResizeFactor in  settings.

Of you make it 1.1 for example it will scale the size of the box and the SL and TP levels with 10%. That is 5% on the top of the box, and 5% on the bottom.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
One of my filters is not to trade on 'no news days'

Today no GBP news and only minor USD.

As expected, a low range day (so far) with two stop outs either side of the box.

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
While I agree that the NFP announcement day is a difficult day to trade, I have been very sucessful on those days trading 2 hours after the announcement. Seems to get all the fluff out and careful reading of all the numbers seems to generate consensus about that time. I daytrade only and get out a half hour before the NFP.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Do you qualify a "minor USD" based on news Volume, or Announcement relevancy ?

Does your 5min confirmation match that I illustrated above?

Thanks for the info HedgeGuy ... I've never been a big NFP guy so any insight is appreciated.

Announcement relevacy

Does your 5min confirmation match that I illustrated above?

Yes

Nevertheless you will see that by strictly using the rules as specified on page one and by using the progressive staking recommended, yesterday would still have returned a profit (after two losses). By using my filters I am trying to reduce the stress inherent in martingale staking by only trading on days when the big market movers are interested in the currency pair.

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Ive become very facinated by this strategy and very aprreciative of the members on this thread who continue to tweek it and make it better. I am a volume spread trader but have been testing some break out methods that involve this time of the day and box spread. The difference is I am applying volume to the strategy to add confirmation to my innitial entry. I will show some examples using the current Updated strategy mer uses and post some charts when I get back to my main machine at home. Thanks again everyone.

Hi Mer,

I would like to know first of all what timeframe to set the indicator for 3 tier london breakout and secondly the EA does now work, when i backtest it does not give any results at all. For example the magic no is 0.

Of all the trade result mt4 screens that you've posted, are all of these traded manually, if yes for example if you observe eurusd, how many trades do you open for example if the first candle either touches buy or sell entry line.

Please help explain. I've kind of gone through most of the thread in here but can't find the explanation for my question..

no doubt this is an amazing system.

Bala

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
TF is 15mins and I believe all the trades you saw by Mer are manual ones using the indicators

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Like I said in a previous post, and as confirmed by Mer, the LBO is making profits by the random hitting of TP2 and TP3 at occasions depicting higher martingale factor.

That is the very reason you must have the proper set-up with respect to your initial balance in order to bear the punctual DD due to loosing increasing martingaled positions.

I believe today was one of the best example since a long time. I've been in a generally loosing streak for the last 5 days ... Mart factor up to level 6 .... but today was the random big winner as TP1-2-3 were hit on multiple PAIRS, bringing my account in the best position ever.

Accordingly, and based on the proposed optimization I mentioned based on backtested performance, win/loose series, and ADR, I`m under way of reporting a complete stat analysis for at least one PAIR and will let you know the end results. I performed this analysis using the OSS R stat software, for which I'm building a bridge/report analyzer interface. I will further report this to the Co-integration thread started by 7bits at FF to add to the 7bit MT4R interface. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=262827&page=2

If some good statisticians are around the corner, I wouldn`t mind some help, specifically if someone would like to support a post-MT4 report optimization to optimize a strategy based on the Sharpe Ratio, or even better through a Modigliani Risk-Performance adjusted least square optimization. Do not hesitate to PM.

regards,

X.

PS: where is the concept of reversal during volatile conditions ... the last 5 days would have definitely mitigate the exposure, simply trading inside the box.

Hi Mer,

Yesterday i've used the strategy on eurjpy/ eurusd and gbpusd and made money with TP target level 1 only set. I entered the buy stop and sell stop 1 hr later after the line was drawn, therefore i did not trade usdcad as it was flip flopping up and down of the buy entry.

I have few questions i think:-

1) lets say after the window of 7-10 GMT the buy and sell entry lines are drawn with TP target level 1 to 3 and same goes to sell TP target. Do i need to do buy stop and sell stop 3 times with each target with a different level and SL with being the sell entry for all three?

2) once the 7-10hr window box drawned up, and if the 1st candle is at the line of either sell or buy entry, what would be our action, do we wait?

3) instead of 7-10hr windows is there any other window that can be used for example japan market hours and us market hours?

4) Do we plant the buy stop and sell stop immediately after the 10th hour candle and start of the 11th hour candel or observer the best time for entry?

5) Is there any other pairs that can be used to trade other than usdcad, gbpusd, eurusd, eurjpy and gbpjpy

6) I still don't quite get the multiplier strategy if lets say the first target SL and the second is x 2 which will recover the first loss... how does this works.

I'm trying my best to vet through the whole post and replies but unlucky to get the above information.

Hope you could help me on this...

Best Wishes!

Hi Merritt,

I think that it is I nice system, but I don't programmed  in mql4, and I need thay your system only open 2 trade per session and the first trade only take 10 pip at profit and the second only take 5 pip to profit, also I need to add some parameter for example if the hight level to the box is 1.5960 only open the buy stop trade if the price up 5 pip more than the hight level (1.5965) and apply the same parameter to the sell stop, I appreciate your colaboration, thanks.

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Hello xmph,

Let's first define this system which I believe is full of holes in regards to price direction and minimizing risk. The system is defining support and resistance as well as the Stoploss using the Frankfort session's high and low. The top of the box is the high and the bottom is the low. Any cross of the price of the Frankfort session high or low initiates a buy long or a short sell. The hope is this break will be substantial enough to hit the TP levels. If the price crosses the top or bottom and doesn't reach TP1 we wait until the price crosses the opposite top or bottom for a loss. This loss is a variable as post #1055 shows a high of 84 pips to a low of 41 pips.

The prices probable direction and it's eventual target before reversing is left to pure chance and no analysis, either chart or market news comes into the trades. The second and subsequent trades are all done with as little thought as the first trade only this time we increase our bet by adding to the number of contracts by use of a Martingale System.

The thinking here is our odds of winning are getting better since we lost our ass the first time around we will not only win but cover our stupid mistake in the first trade. The longer we lose the better the odds of winning on the very next trade. Money is no object and is just a tool to make money. It's sort of like the oil companies drilling wells. The more dry holes you get the more likely the next one will strike oil. Right. The only difference is the oil companies hire a lot of smart people to increase their odds of hitting oil. In other words they know where to drill before they risk the cost of drilling.

But here we throw caution to the wind and risk/reward is the farthest from our minds. Chart analysis and fundamentals aren't necessary. This is a time based, prior session resistance and support momentum system with neither price direction nor price target ever taken into account.

Now you are saying to optimize this strategy a Sharpe Ratio, or a  Modigliani Risk-Performance adjusted least square optimization calculation will make this gambling system all better. Right.

The whole world would love this idea if it had a chance in hell of actually working. They'd all quit there jobs and go the casino everyday. I'd like a little of that saki you've been drinking it would be easier to swallow this idea.

If you just look at post #1055 which is the last chart Mer posted you'd see a loss of -2665 pips. That equals $13,325 of loss. The next trade is 170 contracts or $263,515.30 + a minimum cost of $3,500 so we have out of pocket cost so far of $279,976.30. He shows a gross profit of 5,173 pips or $25,865 for the week. The risk was 41 pips times 170 contracts times $5 equals $34,850 + costs of around $3,500 is $38,350 total risk to gain an overall weekly gain of $25,865. This risk I remind you is with no consideration of any known trading analysis and would do just as well if you'd flip a coin. This is not putting the system or anybody associated with this system down but is just the fact of the matter.

Who needs a complicated formula to figure out this is just plain crazy. This system needs a warning put on it. "ANYBODY WITH A NERVOUS CONDITION OR A HEART PROBLEM SHOULD NOT TRADE USING THIS SYSTEM".

The two risk evaluation calculations you are asking help on cannot be calculated without some idea of the return on investment. They arrive at a number for comparing one set of values to another.

If anybody here is using this system "as is" and making real money I'd be surprised. This is not to say you couldn't make money in the short term but in the long run the odds are you will lose it all. Don't just believe me on this as all you have to do is google "Martingale System".

I doubt very much if any of you have the means to trade these amounts anyway so any discussion of using this system with the Martingale is probably not worth debate. The other side of the coin is without the Martingale your inevitable losses due to the system being price directionally challenged and a non-existent target will just lengthen the time of your demise.

The ones who still like this system I'd suggest using the maximum box size so 84 pips never is your box size. Adding some things to tell you where the price is most likely to be heading would also be wise. Learn the fundamentals. The first and foremost is to learn how to trade before using a system like this one. Without this knowledge you will not recognize the pitfalls of trading. The markets are a dangerous game for the traders who know what they are doing much less the novice.

The assumption that trading on a demo will teach you to trade is totally wrong. Trading without knowledge just creates bad habits that will keep you from being a professional trader. Trading a demo account with $50,000 when all you can afford is a $5,000 account is not going to work.

I know of only one trader who could and would trade 170 contracts at any given time. This is a professional trader who trades with other peoples money. Nobody bets the house on a single trade. Long term survival should be your first and foremost thought and this is only achieved by learning and controlling risk. Once your money is gone it's game over. It's just that simple. Once you've learned the finality of your trading decisions it will become obvious to you that trading and risking your hard earned money without the knowledge of how to trade is a recipe for financial disaster.

Xmph, if you lost 5 out of the last six days you've got to ask yourself what is wrong with those five days. Thinking that winning one out of six is a good thing is not how you should be thinking. If I lost that many trades I would quit trading until I found out what I was doing wrong.

Trade well and prosper,

Johnny

Wow, where the hell did that come from, is it that time of the month? You, of all people, already knew the risk of this strategy with all the previous posts that were made.  Open your own thread if you have all the answers, my friend or please leave and keep the negative comments to yourself!

i have to agree with him mer.

its a shame that this thread has not continued the work of simple london breakout.

we should be focusing more on what merlintrade is doing in simple london breakout 1

that is a trading system.

im not sure how many people are interested in martingaled stuff to hell.

lets get the mechanics underneath right then go from there.

breakouts are profitable - nothing mad, but they do work.

i know this is pissing on the parade and negative comments arent welcome but i hope this is seen as consructive comment as said, its a shame.

breakouts are a beautiful passive system.

Hello Mer,

First of all I love this system and thank you and Squalou for putting it on FF but I know the pitfalls and I know how to trade. The newbs I see posting all have dollar signs in their eyes. You and some others are posting things that look like a gold mine to them but the cold hard fact is it's fool's gold unless you know how to trade and most importantly how to survive.

To survive this game you need to manage risks which has been written by more intelligent people then either one of us. It is commonly written to risk only two percent of your account on any given trade. Following this rule the risk of $38,350 as I explained in my previous post would suggest a total account value of $1,917,500. A rather hefty amount would you not agree.

On the Forex-money-management site it is written as follows:

Before entering a trade, reassure that risk / reward ratio is at least  1:2 (but ideally 1:3 or higher), which means that chances to lose are  three times less than promises to win.

The profit of $25,865 on a risk amount of $38,350 falls way short of this goal. According to many professional traders this was not a good trading week when risk is factored into the equation.

Since the box size equals the stop loss and this is fully adjustable leaving the system with an 84 pip box size would nullify the trade for most traders using the risk/reward factor of two percent. Why you posted that in your chart is a puzzle to me. An 84 pip box at the top of the chart?

The buy long occurred at the high which was very near the previous day's high which is a major point of resistance. The potential profit of 84 pips X 2 = 168 pips just wasn't there to be had. The outside potential was only the difference between the previous days high and the price at the time of the buy long. This profit potential was hardly enough to cover the cost much less any profit. A knowledgeable trader would never have made this trade hence my suggestion to learn how to trade first before trading this system or any system for that matter.

The negative comments were for the uninformed new traders. Many are not even reading post one much less the whole thread. The smarter traders already know the pitfalls and are trading accordingly. You may get upset with my comments but that was not my goal. Enlightenment is sometimes a hard pill to swallow.

This system can lose and can lose in a big way as seen on your very own chart. A negative 2665 pips or -$13,325 is beyond most traders accounts. I wish for this to be a perfect system but it is not and like most systems it has flaws. The biggest problem is how fast it can lose money and the low win to loss ratio.

Calculating the risk/reward of each trade is not a difficult thing with the right tools. Using complicated formulas to calculate risk is totally unnecessary as it is basic math. The tools don't exist here to estimate reward but once learned can easily be added to the charts. Enough said.

Trade well and prosper Mer,

Johnny

thumbs up to the thread starter, for the last year i ve been looking for a decent breakout system on the gbp/usd. There is a lot to like about this system.

I do not use 0400 to 0700 either. Does that help? Not decrying you Cesarz18, that is your choice and I respect it. I am just trying to get this fellow to do what he feels is right. If he cannot do that he shouldn't trade.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Hi Cesarz18,

The EA is working now on my mt4 platform after I've figured it out that the trade will only be executed the next candle after the "end time". I do not think this EA can allow us to input the no. of pips for the high and low breakout line. My own observation is that adding 1 to 2 pips will suffice for the breakout line.

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
hi hariom

perfect, i think taht you have a good idea to only add 2 pip to the breakout line, but how we can do that?

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
hi cesarz18,

I have been using the 3-Tier London Breakout indicator for manual entry of trades. Perhaps, we can request the developer of the EA to add the feature for us to add the pips.

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
It works for me...out of the box so to speak. That's why I didn't understand the question. I use the hour before London open.

So it wasn't settings then?

There are lots of people that look at a thread, decide that it is a good idea then just ask about TFs, pairs etc without checking for themselves. There is an e-book with the EA that tells how to set everything up. Unless people read it they will not know how to set the thing up.

@ Cesarz Don't believe that the 'cushion' can be added. Actually I know that it cannot. It works on the basis on one, three or five trades; martingale or not by choice and even martingales by fib or any other set of numbers that one wants.

This EA has been written for Mer's trading system and to read his posts works well for him.

Lots of us don't want that. We want the EA to do what we want. I want a 5 pip SL when price comes back into the range: Don't want to pay five times whatever the range is when it doesn't just breakout and run for me. But for the fact that I have unreliable internet I would have gone live with this EA a month ago.

Mer and Squalou have pretty well moved on from this thread so I doubt that there will be any other changes to the EA.

Hotjoey, this thread has run too long and there have been lots of views as to how to trade it. You have to make your own decision, just as you would if someone said "Here is a breakout box...how will you trade it?"

Hi, I have entered data from the past for the 05-08am session, and I have the same observation: to add 5 pips to the border of the session filters out many bad trades. I have been looking for an EA that can do this trick but so far I have not found any.

I appreciate all the work that has been done so far and it seems to me that a little bit more would make a difference in the BO EA.

I like the layout of the "A Simple London Breakout" thread very much, just badly missing this option in the associated EA.

Although I am not a fan of the Martingale solution, I am sure that even those who like it would prefer to see less bad trades in a row. Based on my experience, that could be achieved by adding the [x pips] buffer to the session borders.

I have other observations based on data, so if there is capacity to develop the LBO EA further [or create a variation] I can share the conclusions drawn from data and the data as proof for the strategy [there is a TP and SL strategy, too]. Please let me know if anyone can do the programming further. Please be prepared for a EURUSD session BO-reverse strategy to program as well. I can prove all the strategies with manually entered historical data.

In settings of LBO to adjust a sort of "channel"

Modify : LevelsResizeFactor

For newcomers : don't think LBO is THE Holy Grail...

LBO can work a period of time and can't work another one... like now...

You are on the shoulders of Dragon Fx and nobody can't say where he goes...

--- 帖子 #1129 ---
If I am not mistaken, resize factor does one thing: multiplies the range by the number entered and takes the result as the new range. One day it would add 10 pips, the next day it would add 20, depending on the original session size.

It would be a reasonable option to add standard number of pips to the range as buffer, it would be nice improvement to the EA.

hi, Johnny

Can you explain how to negotiate with these indicators, inputs and outputs are based on stochastic or semafor numbers 1,2,3.

Grateful in advance

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Ok, I put my results of data entry here, just to testify, what a mechanical kind of breakout system could have achieved in the past and why I am looking for a simple EA. The figures below are based on the following rules:

No trade in December-January, August-September [whatever you do, these are looser months]

No trade if range is between 20-49.9 pips

TP and SL is optimized for different session [5-8h] ranges [eg. 55-59.9, 60-64.9, etc]. [How I did this: I entered pullback and maximum profit data and played with these numbers to get the highest profit figures]

Trade trigger: 10 pips outside the session range.

Data is up to data from today, if data was missing in 2011-2010 I entered data of identical month from 2009. In that sense, data below is not that accurate [sometimes we have 2 weeks' data available only in certain months], however, it shows some potential for an EA that runs on simple rules.

Nothing fantastic, about 150-200 pips a month on avarage throughout the year. Does anyone feel like programming it? I think it would be an easy job. Only need to define spike, session range, SL and TP levels for each range [5 pips wide] in percentages of the range. Simple, right?

Please let me know.

Thanks

Rewand, I guess your best bet is to try to adjust the settings of this powerful EA  until you find something close to what you want and also manage the trades yourself where the EA lacks any options you want. Do you want to leave the EA running for few days without watching it? Then this EA might not be exactly what you need. I use this just for placing trades initially, if I'm not around, everyday different, depending on my own bias, then I will modify SL, TP, lot sizes later if I consider. Sometime constant TP, other time, I get out half earlier for example. I also just place trades manually, no EA. It's up to every one how they adjust it and we have to thank Mer and Scaloo for providing it to us for free. For the resize factor you have to probably recalculate yourself everyday based on the range.

Hi, I have just become a number guy, checked past data, - which I can give to anyone interested - and realized that there are certain ranges that give no profit over time. Also, certain ranges go well with certain TP and SL levels. I see no point experimenting further, otherwise it would become not a breakout but managed trade based on indicators [or anything that helps to determine TP or SL levels]. I work daytime, so I do not have time to manage the trade, that's the basic problem. I really can share the data if anyone interested so that it would be obvious what my thinking is based on, it is definitely not an impression but pure facts. My post is not about questionning the EA posted here but a more mechanical approach on the same phenomenon, the 5 to 8 BO.

Anyway, let me know if it is outside the topic of this thread or if it diverts the discussion. I just thought it somehow belongs here. What I would like to see is a very simple EA that works well for those losers, like me, who have to work day and night to make a living.

Regards,

Rewand

Hi Rewand,

for the past couple of months I have been running this EA on a demo account. I would really be interested to study the your stats to compare them with my results.

Many thanks for your efforts

Hi Mercatorix,

The data is attached, you can play with the numbers on the first sheet. Session ranges are indicated, you can filter any session size and month, [column C and H], click on column AF and check the sum as result of the trades.

If you change SL and TP percentages [that is relative to session range], you will see the changes in the P/L figure.

There are three columns in green, worth to explain:

V - Cdl spike: highest/lowest price level the BO candle reached

W - Pullback: highest/lowest price before price reached its highest/lowest level [that is registered in column X]

X - TP HI/LO: - highest/lowest price level to take profit

Let me know what you have to say. I expect something positive : )

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Hi Rewand,

thanks for sharing your stats. I was away for a couple of days so please excuse my late reply. I'll get back to you as soon as I've had a look at your results.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
thanks for answering ! i´m trying with tf 15

If i set max wins 1, an for example win the firdt trade buy, the EA will open a new trade BUY, will open a new trade SELL ?

Hi Guys.

The version of the indicator I have does not draw a box on Mondays, it does however show the monday box in the past. Is there an updated version somewhere?  Your help is appreciated. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
I'm in. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
I am facing the same problem. Already passed the 03:00 timing that i have set for start of time but nothing appear.

I tried the EA in place of indicator and the same problem....

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
Hi All,

It was my understanding that Trade will not be initiated when we have the Box reaches the Max Limit.

I have placed 100pip as the max for my GBPCHF pair. it display NO Trade but 3 short position was still opened. Is this normal?

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
I wanted to stop in here today to let everyone in on some changes that I've requested from sqaulou regarding the EA. I was pondering the other day when I was looking over the  indicator sqaulou made up for forexhard's Stairstep Breakouts thread and I had kind  of a breakthrough idea for the 3 tier LBO EA. I don't know why it didn't hit me until now, but I'm glad it did.

As you know we  incorporated the martingale multiplier parameter where the lot sizes are  increased after a loss at whatever the next multiplier is in the sequence, right? Well,  I thought about this and it came to me that in order to recoup our  losses completely after being stopped out, we should try putting the bulk of the lots into  the first few trades of the five that are placed without increasing the amount of lots being traded at each multiplier level. The reason for this is because the first two target points are the key to recouping the losses and the odds of reaching the other three targets diminish rapidly as the trades progress.

For example, let's say  our box was 30 pips (see pic below), which would put our TP levels at +47, +77, +106,  +134, and +161 pips and we'll use 1 lot per trade as a base. In the first pic below, our  first set of trades ended up being stopped out for -150 pips (30 pips x  5 trades of 1 lot each). Normally, the EA would re-enter the next  sequence of trades at a multiplier of 2. So then the EA would open 5 more trades with 2 lots each instead of 1 lot each (hence the multiplier). Let's say we hit our  first target only then price reversed and stops us out on the other 4  trades, we would end up with +102 pips (+47 pips x 2 (1 trade x 2 lots  each) and +1 pip x 8 (4 trades x 2 lots each)).

As you can add up here, we are still -48 pips in the hole and we have not recouped our loss from the first set of trades (-150 pips +102 pips= -48 pips). Normally, the EA would have  to re-enter again at the same multiplier since we didn't recoup the loss  which puts us at more risk.

Now let's take that same scenario and use  the same multiplier value but stagger the lots differently across the 5  trades. The first sequence we used 5 trades at 1 lot each for 5 lots  total. Using the multiplier of 2 on the next sequence we had a total of  10 lots in play (5 trades x 2 lots each), correct? Now instead of opening 5 trades, evenly  placing the lots at 2 lots each, we place the trades with the first  trade being 5 lots, the second trade being 2 lots and the third, fourth,  and fifth trades being 1 lot each. Even though we still have 10 lots in  play, 70% of the lots are now in the first 2 trades! Placing the  trades this way ensures us that we can recoup our losses at the FIRST TARGET!  Every level we hit after that is now bonus pips, even if we immediately reverse and stop out! As you can see, we went from -48 pips to +90 pips by just re-organizing the amount of lots placed per trade. We didn't change the multiplier, we didn't change the total number of lots in play per sequence.

Before, when we evenly placed the trades, we had to reach the second  target in order to recoup our losses completely, but now with 70% of the lots being used at  the first two target levels, we now make the EA even more powerful than before  because we are A) decreasing our risk, B) increasing equity in the account  faster, and C) not having to repeat a multiplier level to recoup the losses.

I don't know how it could be modified, but if he can, I'd like to see squalou incorporate these trade sizes at each multiplier level. The five numbers after the multiplier are  trade 1, trade 2, trade 3, etc... in that order to be placed at that particular lot size with the  first trade to automatically close at target 1 and so on down the line.

Multiplier 1- 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 = 5 lots in play

Multiplier 2- 5, 2, 1, 1, 1 = 10 lots in play

Multiplier 5- 12, 6, 4, 2, 1 = 25 lots in play

Multiplier 13- 32, 15, 9, 6, 3 = 65 lots in play

Multiplier 34- 81, 38, 24, 15, 12 = 170 lots in play

Multiplier 89- 213, 100, 60, 40, 32 = 445 lots in play

Multiplier 233- 556, 261, 180, 110, 78 = 1165 lots in play

Multiplier 610- 1453, 682, 400, 295, 220 = 3050 lots in play

Remember, I'm just using 1 lot as a base in these examples. You would most likely be using .1 or .01 lots. So, if you were at a multiplier of 13, and depending what lot size you use a a base, you would have anywhere from .65 to 65 lots in play.

I am using Alpari and its 1 hour ahead on the MT4 than GMT and When I check the indicator it got 06:00 to 09:00 set.  So what time do I need to change in the indicator.

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
I certainly would like this new idea to be incorporated into the EA. The numbers don't lie

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
The times are pretty flexible. I've seen people use a larger box and go from 00:00 to 07:00 and have success and other have ran the end of their box an hour past the London open. It's totally up to you to play around with the times to find out what works best for you.

You are right, numbers don't lie. I'm just amazed I didn't catch on to it until now. sqaulou is trying to put together a formula as the coding is going to be a little tricky. If we end up with half lots it will be tough to use if the trader is working with .01 lot sizes. I'm trying to see if we can manually input the lot size for each trade at each multiplier level so we can truly fine tune each multiplier level. Me personally, If I'm getting up to a multiplier of 34 or higher, I might want to progressively increase the percentage of the lots toward the first couple of trades, going from say 70% up to maybe 80-85%. So give him some time and we'll see what he comes up with, I'm sure it will be amazing.

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
Well, I wanted to come in while we are waiting for sqaulou to attempt to incorporate the changes I've mentioned above, I wanted to go over a few pairs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the modifications we are trying to make. I am only going to concentrate on Gbp/Usd as this is generally the most popular pair that a lot of us trade.

Now with the debt ceiling raised and with all the panic with the US losing it's AAA-rating, most of those in the stock markets are getting their asses handed to them in a big way. So, let's see how we did in the trades from last Monday until Friday and see how the new staggered lots performed compared to the original

Now their are a few things I'm doing now that some of you might not be doing. A) In order to not carry over trades, I'm closing all trades, whether in profit or not, at the close of the candle at 00:00 GMT every day. B) Only increase lots after a loss, if we do not recoup losses we stay at the same multiplier until we do or either we get stopped out or close out trades for a loss, then we adjust the multiplier. And C) I've also adjusted my times to 00:00 GMT to 07:14 GMT to show an earlier, more consolidated box than before. If you want to follow exactly, I'm using Go Markets and since they are GMT +1, you'd set your times for 01:00, 08:14, and 01:00. My examples will be using 5 trades per multiplier sequence. If you want to use less, that is up to you, but make sure to adjust the lot sizes accordingly to ensure you get at least 70% of the lots on the first 2 trades. I will post my template here at the end of this post.

On the charts I am going to be as abbreviated as I can to save time. Most of you who are following this thread and are using the strategy already know what my charts look like. If you don't, re-read the thread to get familiar with how the strategy works as I will not answer questions that can be answered by doing a little reading.

Okay, on the chart there will be Black, Red, and Blue boxes. Black is our entry and re-entry points. Red boxes represents a price reversal and all 5 trades are being stopped out. Blue boxes are obviously Profit Targets that have been reached. When we either stop out or reach a profit target, I will place a marker box with numbers in it. When looking at the red boxes, the first number is the multiplier level for that set of trades, the second number is the pips lost. Since the total number of lots from both the old and the new way we divide the lots per trade will be the same at each multiplier level, we will only need one total for our losses because no matter how you divide it up, the total amount of loss will be the same. With the Blue boxes, you will see 3 numbers. First is the multiplier again, second is the pips earned for that target hit using the old lot sequence, and the third is the same except we used the new lot sequence from post #1147 above. If you see a parentheses after a number, that is either the lots size for that particular trade or the total number of pips times the number of trades closed like when we close at 00:00 or on Friday. After you see a few charts you'll get the idea.

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
Okay, before I start posting up charts, I want to explain that last week was as about as perfect as you can get with this strategy (barring hitting every profit target). I mean we didn't have any reversal stop outs nor did we have to close out trades at 00:00 GMT at a loss. Take a picture as this is a rarity that we might not see for quite a while. I can only attribute this to using earlier start times, but I can't be for certain.

Alright, Monday shows us a 66 pip box with a first target being hit for +106 pips. We just missed Target 2 by .00003 pips, which sucks, but not to say a different broker would show a different result. we ended up closing the remaining 4 trades for +109 pips each at 00:00 GMT for a total of +436 pips. Since we had no stop outs and we never made it past multiplier 1, both profit amounts on the chart will be the same as we enter the same size trades for both the old and new sequence at this level. Only at a multiplier of 2 and higher do the trades sizes differ from the old to the new.

Awesome intraday trading results!

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
Thank you sir, but last week's results really do not show the martingale effect that this strategy is known for, so we'll see how this week goes with the stock drop and all going on.

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
wow...lol, simply amazing. Guess i need to go to post one and learn how to trade this system.....just read the previous page, good luck with the modifications you mentioned! BTW...did the EA get the same/similar results last week?

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
The old EA hasn't been modified yet with the new lot parameters, but I'm sure the EA will have different results due to the spread, etc..., but again, when the new EA is finished it will be tested thoroughly before anything is presented here. Since we never had a sequence stopped out last week, the old EA should have been pretty close to my visual backtest.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
Would have had a stopout today tho I guess?

Mer:

Are you posting results with the new lotsizing you spoke of last week?  I really like the idea as you do, weighting larger lots for tp1.  I guess I can find out for myself when you post today's results

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Yes, we did have a stop out today, I just haven't posted a chart for Monday yet. If you look at the blue boxes on the charts, the first pip total is with the old lot sizing and the second pip total is with the new lot sizing. It's a little confusing from last week as level 1 of the martingale sequence uses the same starting lots size for each trade, so the totals will be the same. The only time the martingale will benefit us is when target 1 is hit or if we close out all 5 trades at 00:00 GMT like we did on the chart below.

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
Monday shows us a 69 pip box and we had our first stop out as price reversed and closed us out with -345 pips (-69 x 5). Now just to review, since we had a loss we would now use a multiplier of 2. In the original strategy, we would now open 5 trades of 2 lots on the re-entry for a total of 10 lots. Now with the new lot sizing we would now open trades 1-5 at 5, 2, 1, 1, and 1. We still have a total of 10 lots open, but now we are trading with at least 70% of the lots on trades 1 & 2. We never did hit target 1 and ended up closing all 5 trades for +55 pips each for a total of +550  pips. Even though we still did not reach a target 1, we garnered enough pips to recoup our losses and we will start back at level 1 on Tuesday. I was hoping to hit target 1 to show individual trade comparisons, but we will just have to be patient.

Grand total for the day- +205

When I try to just make the first multimplicador, going directly to 2 and from 2 to 3 ... Please could someone help me?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
The EA was developed for the thread and I thought it worked well when it was tested (except for a few small bugs), then all sorts of changes were made which others begged to have put in which I didn't think were necessary. The first version to the last version of the EA is no different in functionality from one to the next, they just have different parameters added in as the EA has developed. The best thing to do is to read through the thread and read up on the changes that have been made and test, test, test, then decide which version to use. I do not use any version of the EA yet because  I'm still waiting for sqaulou to make changes to the EA for me personally. I also haven't used the EA due to the capital needed to safely guard against the possibility of hitting the higher multipliers and not being in control of that aspect concerns me.  I hope the changes that sqaulou can try and code into the EA will diminish the likelihood of this happening so smaller accounts can be used to trade it.  If I had a half million to throw at it, I wouldn't hesitate a bit because that would be enough of an equity buffer to keep the EA from running into a margin call, but I'm not quite there yet . I am waiting for MY personal version to be modified so I can test it and use it when it's finished. When sqaulou finishes the latest version of the EA for those following the thread, I will post it in post #1, but my version though will not be posted.

Right now, I try and trade  the strategy manually using various scripts when needed and I  manually put in stop losses and profit targets when I place the trades. It's a lot of work but  until I'm completely satisfied and fully confident in the EA, I'd rather  sit and put in the screen time to watch the trades progress on their  own. I have multiple screens on my computer and a TV next to it so I can just pop in a movie or surf the internet while I'm trading to kill the time.

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
Yes, you can edit it in MetaEditor and permanently change it or just change the inputs in the EA's parameters (see pics). But remember, the multiplier sequence is calculated this way for a reason in order to recoup losses as quickly as possible.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Okay we finally get a chance to see how the recovery process will go. Tuesday we had a reversal to start the night for -430 pips on the sell off (which was expected today) and we closed out at 00:00 for -380 pips. Tomorrow we will look to enter at a multiplier of 5.

Grand total for the day- -810

-$8100.00 @ 1 lot per trade

-$810.00 @ .1 lot per trade

-$8.10 @ .01 lot per trade

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
Okay, we are back to see how we recovered from yesterday's sell off. Wednesday had a 55 pip box with an immediate entry on the very next candle after the box formed. Our first two targets were hit. We ended up closing the  remaining 3 trades at 00:00 GMT for +139 pips each. Let compare the two lot sizing totals. As you can see with the new lot sizing, we recouped our -810 pip loss from yesterday at out first target. We didn't recoup our loss until we hit target 2 with the old lot sizing.  If price would have reversed off target 1, we would've had to re-enter again using a multiplier of 5 (according to the rules of the strategy). Since the new lot sizing recouped immediately at target 1, we can now start fresh from the starting multiplier instead.

Old Lots- 5, 5, 5, 5, 5

Target #1- +445 pips (+89 x 5 lots)

Target #2- +725 pips (+145 x 5 lots)

New Lots- 12, 6, 4, 2, 1

Target #1- +1068 pips (+89 x 12 lots)

Target #2- +870 pips (+145 x 6 lots)

Now there is a disadvantage to using the new lot sizing that I want to make sure to point out here. Again the goal of the new lot sizing is to protect us and recoup losses at the first target, but if we continue down and do not retrace the old lot sizing catches up and we end up losing pips. Looking at the remaining lots(in blue) that were closed at 00:00 GMT, you can see the difference.

Old Lots- 5, 5, 5, 5, 5

Closed remaining trades- +2085 pips (+139 x 15 lots remaining)

New Lots- 12, 6, 4, 2, 1

Closed remaining trades- +973 pips (+139 x 7 lots remaining)

Even though price continued past out first target, I still feel a lot more comfortable with the idea of stacking the lots on the first two trades as we will see target 1 & 2 hit far more often than the rest. I will easily sacrifice those pips we would lose out on from hitting targets 3-5 in order to lower the risk of reaching higher multipliers any day of the week. There are too many pairs and too many opportunities to be had to worry about missing pips here and there.

Grand total for the day- Old- +3255

-$32,550.00 @ 1 lot per trade

-$3255.00 @ .1 lot per trade

-$325.50 @ .01 lot per trade

Grand total for the day- New- +2911

-$29,110.00 @ 1 lot per trade

-$2911.00 @ .1 lot per trade

-$291.10 @ .01 lot per trade

We are now back to trading back at a multiplier of 1 for tonight.

One more question, the EA can be configured to compute a fixed box size? such that the box always measures 30 pips?

Thanks again Mer.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
To be honest, sqaulou is the man to ask on that one. I know you can put your Max Box size to 30 pips and you'll never have a box larger than that, but it still won't be a fixed box size.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
thanks Mer .

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Well, no risks, no gains.

I still prefer the new trick, not bad after all.

Cheers!

hi dear

my mt4 is GMT +3 so that means i have to change the follwoing settings:

start time 6 to 9

end time 9:14 t0 12:15

sassion end time 4:30  to 7:30

waiting for your answer ?

many thx

ammar

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
ammar, I've recently adjusted my times to be based off of 00:00 GMT to 07:14 GMT with an end session time of 00:00 GMT. If you are GMT +3, you would add 3 hours to each of those times to match what I showing in my charts. Now, you can use whatever start times you wish to use, you don't have to stick to mine. I'm just using these times in my examples so everyone is on the same page. Actually, I might even look into moving my end of the box back an hour to 06:14 GMT to get away from the Frankfurt open, but that's another day.

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
Ran into this thread last week. Quick manual back testing with my personal setting seems very promising. Only problem is my indicator does not draw Monday box. Also the EA does not work monday morning. If this problem has been pointed out and addressed before my sincere apology. I am scanning through the thread to find the answer. Other than than that I am having a very good trading day so far with this system.

Thank you Mar for this system.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
I'm glad you like the strategy and I hope you do well with it. The best thing is to use a broker that does not have a Sunday candle like Go Markets (which is what I use). What version of the indicator are you using because that might be an issue as well (V.3.1 is the latest I believe)? If you're using the latest versions and are still having issues, the only thing you can do is to PM sqaulou with those issues since he is the creator of the EA and the indicator and he might tell you what the problem might be. He is on vacation right now so it may be a bit before he can look into it.

_________________________________

Speaking of indicators, I have slightly modified V.3.1 and added two new levels. Right now, these levels are only for visually moving your stops to help lessen the blow when we have those crazy reversals and we get stopped out. The first level is at the 61.8 extension and suggests you to move your stop to the "Sell Stop 1/Buy Stop 1" which is the 50 fib retracement level that splits the box in two. The second level is at the 123.6 extension and tells you to move your stop to "Buy Stop 2" or "Sell Stop 2", and these levels, depending if it's a buy or a sell, are placed at the 23.6 and 76.4 fib retracement levels. I'm hoping that when sqaulou gets back from vacation that we can add these in as optional, adjustable parameters.

Hopefully these new levels will help you lower the loss you may get on a retracement that can happen before we reach our targets (see pic 1 for a recent example). Lowering these losses also gives you the option to use a smaller multiplier to recoup your losses instead of using the default multiplier sequence in the original strategy. Now these new levels are not going to be reached all the time and they may even cause you to stop out trades that normally wouldn't get stopped out with regular V.3.1, but that is just one of those things that you can't control. Feel free to try it out first to see if it will help you in your trading and if it's not for you, stick with V.3.1.

p.s. If you know how to edit in MetaEditor, feel free to adjust the default levels to whatever you wish to either move the stops sooner or later in the trade (see pic 2).

p.s.s. Pic 2 to should read 1.382, not 1.0382, sorry.

Brilliant work on this EA - love ya passion

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
Thank you for the comments, but you should thank sqaulou as he is the coding guru responsible for all of it. I hope when he gets off vacation that he can quickly make the changes to the existing EA to make it better.

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
When the EA is changed, i will do what R Kiyosaki mentioned in one of his books: "If you have limited resources, diversification is not for you. Instead, put all you eggs in one basket and watch the eggs VERY carefully."

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
Smart man, very good book by the way. The big issue though with this strategy is not being able to watch the eggs, it's the proper capitalization of the account that makes the strategy successful. I can't count how many people try and throw a grand on a mini account and expect to do well.

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
Are you done posting results Mer?

Awaiting squalou's return to make the changes you've incorporated myself also.  Even just having the existing ea close trades at 0100 would help in the backtesting.

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
I just wanted to put up a few examples of the changes so everyone can see how they're different from the original strategy. Unfortunately, it's too time consuming to post results everyday with everything going on outside of trading. I think having the trades closed at end of day would help the EA with only having to manage one sequence of trades instead of two or three, plus it is probably easier to code.

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
I do understand the concepts underlying this strategy, thank you very much

Just for a laugh, my limited resources is big enough to trade this strategy

--- 帖子 #1186 ---
Mer:

Thanks for all the thought on this strategy.  I have been following the Stairsteps Breakout thread and found your comments there to be very helpful.  So, I came over here to your thread to learn some more.  I now understand why you are interested in that thread.

Now I am really enthused to see the EA with the mods you have proposed.

Hi everyone,

First Thanks to the creaters of the system and the EA, well done guys.

I would like to ask a question. If price breaks the box short then retraces and goes through the box long, is there a setting that will allow a long entry as well. Instead of cancelling it after the short has triggered. I guess in other words is there a way of turning the OCO feature off so you can trade both ways in 1 day?

Cheers

Coastie

--- 帖子 #1191 ---
The EA should already close the short and automatically place a new long trade at the next multiplier on the reversal.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
Hi Mer,

Im not using the Martingale strategy, should it still close one and open the other, cause its not doing it for me. Maybe ive got the settings wrong.

Your help would be appreciated.

Cheers

Coastie

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
Hard to say unless you can post a screenshot with your settings. Also, is the journal saying anything unusual? You might have to e-mail sqaulou if you are having issues.

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
Ok thanks. Not sure how to get screenshot of settings. but settings are standard. will send message to sqaulou.

Hello everybody!

Im a trader from Pakistan.

I keep following forexfactory alot in fact i learned to trade from here. I have not been successful though but can't blame anybody for so because I never traded a system. I thought I m smart enough to trade without a solid system. As expected I've just blown my live account of 2200USD well that was a lot for me at least. At one point it was 4200.

I gave my background just to let you people know how brilliant a trader I m!  Anyhow lets come to the point I want to share my humble opinion about the entries of London breakout system pardon me If you don't like. I wanted the entry to be at a distance of some percentage of Average Daily Movement of the pair. Lets assume we are entering at 50%of Average Daily Movement of last x days away from the box. So if Average Daily Movement of cable for last 10days is 126pips then we should enter at 63pips away from the box. I know it will decrease our gains for the day but I think it would give 30 to 50 pips most of the days.  The percentage of Avg. movement for entries can be changed to what ever fits best to a system. I have not tested this method as yet but we need some calculation tools to help us do so. Just my humble thoughts. I would love if Sq can  add this entry option to his indicator/EA.  Sq your help as usual will be much appreciated. Thank you.

Eid Mubarik in advance to every body.

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
I appreciate your opinion awan, but that is really defeating the purpose of the strategy. When you enter the trade as you are proposing, you are limiting the amount of pips required to make up the losses you will occur with this. The main point of the strategy is not the entry point of the trade, but how the next trade size is determined to recoup the losses you incur and to get you back into positive territory. I highly doubt that this is an option that will make it into the EA, but feel free though to test this out on your own and I hope it works well for you.

You actually might want to check out the Stairstep Breakouts thread by forexhard as his indicator (made by sqaulou) has an option to put a pip buffer as many pips away from the box (which is calculated using a percentage of the Average True Range based on "X" number of bars) as you wish. If you want to put a pip buffer 63 pips away, you can do it.

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
Hi, i`m playing around with the different EAs of squalou and the open source ones and wondering if there is one with the modification "trail starts after BE" ? might be interesting.

love this strategy, thanks for great work.

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
We talked about that before we made this one and we decided against it because the EA moved the stops after each TP level already and visual testing showed no additional benefit.

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Mer, could you keep charts coming?

PBh

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
It is very tough with my schedule to devote my time to posting charts. I will post a few charts from this week to help with the visuals, but you must get in there do some of the testing on your own as I am not here to do the work for you. I'm not trying to be harsh about this but in order for you to get better, it takes initiative on your part to learn. Are you having specific problems that you are not understanding?

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
Only one, could you please post the Start Time, End time and Session End Time, EST? So, I'll be sure that I am using the right hours. I would post the daily charts then

Some recommended pairs would help me doing this.

Thank you

Don't mind me.  Just passing through...

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Hi guys,

after manually backtesting many pairs, range duration, martingale numbers, fixed TPs... I found that G/U and E/J are pretty much the most profitable of all (for fixed TP). I've decided to trade live, few months ago, with TDFX (for leverage): G/U, breakout of 4-10AM GMT range (7x H1 candles), no buffer, no 15 min wait, Mart: 1,5,13,34 (maximum 4), range < 100 pips, no new trade until current one is closed.

I stopped trading it because they kicked me out, being a US resident, now I will probably look for another one. I made just like 20% profit due to a lot of mistakes.

I started with a small deposit (calculated to sustain 4 losses and one 100 pips range loss, until a margin call).

I traded starting with the EA for a new trade and then switched to manual trade to avoid opening of a new trade next day, if current one was not closed yet. I mean by this including martingaling until a winning trade is over, might be after few days. I would've preferred to have the EA being able to do this.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
First off, if you read through the thread, the Start Time, End time and Session End  Time are based on your broker's time, not your actual timezone. Just find out what your broker's time is in the MarketWatch and compare to the actual /GMT time and add/subtract those times to get the indicators time set correctly. The are really no "best pairs" to use as the results will generally be the same. Using pairs with good trending movement and small spreads are best but I've seen people use a variety of charts to trade on. THe pairs that I use are mostly Eur/Usd, Gbp/Usd, Usd/Chf, and Eur/Chf, but you can trade whatever pairs you desire.

If you are going to do this live, you really should use 1, 2, 5, 13 for your martingale as it will lower the amount of risk when your in the market. What do you do if you reach a multiplier of 34 and get stopped out??? About the closing of one trade while another is open is going to be addressed in the new EA. Hopefully you will be able to set the end time in the EA to close all trades at a specific time. Some people will want to close them early like the end of the U.S. session, some will wait until the candle before the new box forms, everyone will be different.

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
That was based on my assumption that 5th loss would be very rare (from backtesting) and somehow I would trade it with other methods, manually, hopefully without loss .

I thought 34 was needed to cover 3 losses (of 100 pips max) since the TP was very small and plus would give more profits sometimes, but you're right it works better with smaller numbers and psychologically it could be traded easier. My idea was to snowball a small account fast to a fixed amount (let's say 100k) then, start over again with 2k let's say (even this 2k withdraw it after you make them). Same thing then can be extended to  2, 3 pairs, different ranges, all fixed TPs... some will hit the ground, but at least one will eventually make it to my fixed amount, then withdraw and start from the beginning.

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
Hello there,

Out of curiousity I believe this is very similar to the 0400-0700 GMT Breakout Strategy here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=4925506

Unfortunatly I read that entire thread (all 200 pages) over the past 3  days, and it's died off, I believe on page 199 someone mentions this  thread, and it's very much alive !

Now I'm really not ready to read all this thread, well not until  tomorrow as I'm tired of reading (3 hours worth so far tonight) and just  want to know if this is similar to the other strategy and is it  profitable.

I will read tomorrow !

Thanks.

for long term trading, BreakOut system will only have a negative result

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
I have been testing the EA and it seems to TP @ level tp3 or tp5 depending on how it is setup "level 3 or 5". it does not close one @tp1 then tp2, tp3 and so on, has anyone else experianced this? keep pipin

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
Every breakout method will have similarities and I'm sure if you search the forum you'll find 100 or more threads on breakouts. Like I said before, you must read the thread through and that will answer most of your questions. There have been some changes that are being worked on as we speak, so be patient.

Since you are obviously a newbie here with only 10 posts as of this reply, you might want to read up on the difference between long term trading and intraday trading as no where in this thread does it mention that this is a "long term" strategy.

As I've mention numerous times before, if you have issues with the EA you need to pm sqaulou as he is the coder and he is better suited to answer any questions regarding problems with the EA or the indicator.

Hi Guys, this indicator does not draw a box on a Monday, I specified 04:00 to 07:00 and my broker is IBFX with 00.00 GMT as the start of a new day. Past Mondays are OK but on Monday itself the box only gets drawn late in the afternoon, round about 16:00 GMT. I have mentioned this before but recieved no reply.

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
I've PM'd sqaulou and asked him to look at it since he is the one who made the indicator. I'm having the same issue while testing out Oanda's MT4 platform and it's due to the Sunday trading. Go Markets does not have Sunday trading so there is no issues with the indicator. I can only suggest not trading on Sunday/Monday while using the indicator until it is fixed. Oh, and by the way, my IBFX demo is GMT-1 (see pic), strangely enough.

That might actually be from the first breakout thread before this one, not sure though without going back to look.

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
Hi Mer, London is not GMT london time now this time of year is GMT+1. Look at your IBFX chart at the Period seperator, the vertical dotted line and you will see that the time is 00:00

i have a suggestion:

would be added to the indicator of the first image fibo levels which has the second indicator?

(sorry for my english) xD

I am interested in the first indicator, because the entries are more accurate.

thanks!

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
My bad, you are correct. I keep forgetting that damn summer GMT shift. Anyhow, the problem is still due to the Sunday trading, so once sqaulou takes a look at it, we should be okay.

tnavi, the source code for the indicator is there if you want to make those changes yourself, but I am not making the changes here as I want to keep the thread in line with the original strategy and guidelines. Personally, I think you are going backwards by increasing the stoploss with the buffer, but not increasing your TP levels proportionally to match it. In the first pic you increased the stoploss of 30 pips by 30% to 39 pips (30 pips x .3= 9 pips). You'll need to make your TP target 30% farther out to make up the extra pips added to your stop. And I'm actually in Iowa City about an hour and a half from Des Moines.

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
I once have a copy of Jason Fielder's standalone indicator that will update the SL and TP without being trace by the brokers. The indicator was corrupted when I accidentally opened outside mtq4. Once the indicator is placed in the chart it capture the existing trades with the Order #, Type, Symbol/pair, Price, and fields where Stop Loss and TakeProfit to be field up/modified by the trader. If we could come up with the same technique, it would be a good help for manual traders.

Thanks,

Edd

Hey Mer,

I've done my fair share of EA coding.  This thread has piqued my interest, let me know if Sqaulou is too busy to implement any of your requested changes, and I'll see what I can do (for free of course).  My only requirement is that the EA be posted to the thread for free

In any case, a strategy like this is best suited for a broker like Oanda, which allows for any lotsize you want.  There's a lot of talk here about requiring a large amount of capital to trade this strategy due to the martingale, using Oanda would resolve this issue as you can start out the trade as small as needed to manage the risk.

A 1 unit trade on Oanda = 1 cent per 100 pips

Unfortunately Oanda's MT4 platform, like every other MT4, only allows for trades in denominations of 1,000 units (a microlot).  This can only be accomplished by coding the EA to control the keyboard  and mouse and enter the trade on Oanda's Java interface.  I've had  success with this in the past, but stopped using it when Oanda's MT4  platform was launched.

If there is any interest here, I can modify the EA to allow for this.  At the very least I can add an alert to notify your cell phone when the trades are supposed to be happening, so can you run over to Oanda's platform and do them manually

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
Hey DodgeV8

I am interested in the indicator only and not the EA. I have requested in this thread that if someone has the time to please look at the indicator, on a Monday it does not draw the box, apparently this is because of the Sunday trading (I am with IBFX). Past mondays are all drawn but like today there will be no box. If you have time can You please have a look at it, I think Mer also mentioned it somewhere in this thread.

thanks stax.

Does this do what you want?  I haven't had time to properly test and I'm still very new to this thread, but it seems this didn't have any unintended side-effects.

Let me know.

Edit:  Updated, fixed an issue with the first upload and incremented the version number.  I'm not sure how this version will work on other brokers, but it looks good on IBFX.  Here's how it looks now with 04:00 - 07:00, end time 12:00

Thanks DodgeV83.

It is drawing the Box now but seems to have a lot of extra data such as Sell stop 1 , sell stop 2 etc wich makes the usefull info like the entry prices and targets almost unreadable, I dont know where this extra info comes from but it was not there before.??

The top one is the new one, you can see the extra info.

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
Hi DodgeV83,

do you think you can modify the MT4 version to stick with martingaling one trade only? Let's say a trade is triggerred after 4:00 - 10:00AM GMT interval and it takes 3 days after the 5th iteration to win, but no other trade would be placed in the meanwhile.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
Hi DodgeV83

Here is the version of the indicator that I am using, It works perfectly except that it does not draw the Monday Box on a Monday, it actually draws the box but only very late in the day approx. 12:00 Gmt then the box appears.

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
Are you sure that's the code you're using?  When I put it on my chart it looks the same as the one I posted.  The screenshots in my previous post show they look the same in that regard.

Can you post your settings as well?

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
Hey dodge, I'm always interested in any help the comes my way, thank you. Here's the only version of the EA I have (you'll have to check the attachments to see if any newer ones are posted). I have asked sqaulou to make some changes but he has been extremely busy with other projects. If you want to take a crack at it, send me your e-mail address and I will get you the details of how the EA should run.

The sell stop/buy stops are just visual triggers for you to move your stop once the price has reached these points (see pic). Reaching Targets 2 and later, the stops are moved to the level immediate below them. I've attached the latest version that I am using.

By the way john, try using more than just a 30 minute box. That is way too short of a time period to get any kind of consistent results. Just a word of advice, you should try at least a 2-3 hour box, preferably before the London open begins to take advantage of the consolidation before the big movements kick in.

--- 帖子 #1236 ---
Sorry, My mistake, the attached indicator is what I use, it is an older version. This is the one I want to use.

Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #1237 ---
Hi Mer, I have been trading my strategy for more than a year now with my settings and my RR/ MM I am doing pretty well. Using a larger Box (2 or 3 Hours) most of the time the innitial move is inside your box and you would have missed the large part of the move. I only trade EURUSD and do remember that the European market opens 1 hour before London and being the Euro the breakouts can start during this session. Anyway, every man to his own thinking. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
Two updates below.  One for the "b" version posted above, and one for the version I posted earlier.  Now there is a "MondayFix" option.  Set to True to apply the fix I made, set to False to take the fix away.  Since I'm not sure how this will effect other brokers, I've made it an option.

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
Hey DodgeV83

Looks great, thanks, but I will have to wait until Monday to see if it works but I am sure it will be OK.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
I tested it in the Strategy Tester (Control - R).  It worked fine

--- 帖子 #1241 ---

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
Hi Dodge,

really appreciate this Monday fix update, have been lurking in the back ground following this thread since conception. Hoping some day this would get fixed.

Mer's system is amazing!

Thank you, all!

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
I was not aware the EA would take additional trades from the next day's box even while a current martingale is being worked out.  Am I understanding you correctly?

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
It does take multiple trades, but the new rule I proposed regarding the trades that sqaulou was supposed to work on was that the EA would would close all open trades at the session end time, whether in profit or not. But again, sqaulou has not made it that far so I will get the new EA parameters I wanted to you as soon as I free up some time to see if you can help out since sqaulou is probably a little overloaded right now with other projects.

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
Hi Mer,

is it possible to incorporate the "two bar closed below the box" as used in the indicator on FH's indie sqDynamicboxbreakout?

I think this would be a useful addition to your system.

I have been back testing this to your system and it improves the positive trades considerably!

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
The problem that arises here is you shorten the gap between the entry point and the first target which means you'd have to increase your target distance to make up for losing those pips. Plus, if you use the opposite side of the box as your initial stop, you have now increased the stop loss as well and that is not the way the strategy is designed.

Forexhard's stairstep breakout strategy does not rely on specific target distances like this strategy does, so I doubt that it will be added, but if you want to use that format manually, more power to you.

--- 帖子 #1247 ---
Hi DodgeV83.

If possible do you think you could add an Entry buffer to this indicator. What I am looking for is to be able to specify a number of pips either above the "Entry Buy" or below the "Entry sell". EG. If I specify 7, then the "Entry Buy" or "Entry Sell" price must show 7 pips above or seven pips below. All other calculations for profit targets must then also take the new Buy or sell price into considderation.

I have attached the indicator that I want you to change, if you can, this is the one that you changed for me to fix the Monday box problem.

Your help is appreciated.

John.

Hi everyone, I'm new to the forum. I am writing this post to thanks mer, squalo and dodge for a good job done and for sharing it free (without forget to thank great forum which is FF). I am an Italian trader (sorry for my bad english) and in a few days I've read all this interesting 3d. For a couple of days I'm testing the indicator posted by Dodge (now 3.3b v3.2b) with good results on E/U and G/U. I am using as the start session 3:00 GMT end session 6:14 GMT (do you think is good period time?). None of you are using an indicator or oscillator for filtering the signal breakout? I hope to be able to participate actively in this 3d, for now I wish you all a good trading guys!

So if Mer wants to have this option is fine, but for me I would prefer to stick with the initial breakout box until eventually closes successfully, many times after at least a day.

For example, a trade is placed Tue, at 10:00 GMT, going short at the lower edge of the box; then Tue, at 23:00GMT SL is hit and EA enters another trade in the opposite direction (long) with the second Martingale level; at 10:00 GMT next day, Wed, no SL or TP is hit yet we are still in the second level trade, but no trade is placed for the new box that was just displayed; at 12:00 GMT Wed, SL is hit again and a short trade is entered at the lower edge of the first day (Tue) breakout box (3rd Martingale level); at 17:00 GMT Wed, TP is hit for the only trade that we were in and no more trade is placed for that day; at 10:00 GMT next day (Thu) EA will enter a new trade. I'm not sure if "SessionEndTime" or "MaxTrades/Wins/LossesAllowedPerSession" parameters will have to be tweaked as well to accomplish this after you change the EA (I tried so far but didn't work).

Thank you very much in advance!

Dear Mer,

let's come out of the lurker crowd, here, for saying a big thank you to all the contributors, but expecially to you. It is quite uncommon finding good traders who are also good teachers and nice people, and you're surely one of the few.

So after reading the whole thread (besides, sorry, the "diverging section"), coming from "outside" the thread (and even FF: the world is bigger! LOL!) I must say the most "shining" feature of your system seems to be the controlled use of Martingale as risk management device. Actually, I would summarize (form myself) your system as composed by two elements: a BO (with proper TP levels) AND a Martingale scheme.

So, I would like to ask you two questions that I think were not fully addressed so far in the thread looking for answers, but eventually also other comments:

1. If you would try to separate conceptually the two parts, which one do you think is the "more responsible" for the trading success of this strategy? BO or Martingale? I ask because, just as a superficial impression, sometimes it looks like that your "way of Martingaling" would make wonders even just with a random entry... I.e. with "zero edge" systems. xmph spoke in the past pages of win/loss ratio being very bad, and he promised (unfortunately without a follow up) statistics which would have been quite interesting... Did you/anybody had consistent success with this method without martingaling?

2. Being undercapitalized is a very bad thing with this system, as we all know. Is there a system of yours or others that you would suggest for slowly building up a decent working capital from few money?

Thanks in advance for your surely exciting reply.

Hallo people: were my questions, especially the first one, scaring everybody here?

Or is simply the fellowship dispersed? (Eventually the quest for the ring is concluded?...).

Sorry, I've been out of town on business so I apologize.

To be honest, they are both important. But I would say that the martingale aspect has the higher prevalence here by I'd say maybe a 65/35 ratio because the martingale aspect can be adapted to "zero edge" systems and other strategies (not recommended though). I respect xmph and his opinions, but that is a common thing on these forums where someone will make comments like that but fail to provide proof. That is why I put up my charts to show that over a longer period of time, with proper account capitalization, this system can work. I have tried manual forward testing without using the martingale before I even started the thread and did not have very good results without the martingaling aspect.

Right now, I am looking into a few new modifications to the EA here on this thread. I am also following forexhard's Stairstep Breakouts thread and looking into the possibility of using sqaulou's indicator he made for that thread and melding it with the EA he made here. The reason why is because of the consolidation method that he uses will improve the breakout success allowing us to lower the number of multipliers used in it's trading and because the consolidation zones are much smaller and consistent in size which also lowers the overall risk. I am also looking into a modified version of the SRDC I strategy which uses the hi/low of the daily candle as your entry, but that is still being worked on and tested as we speak.

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
Thank you very much for your reply, Mer. Very interesting as expected.

I will think about more and more, and eventually come back with some comments in the near future. The first impression is that, yes: I also think that without martingaling the "smart way" you do those breakouts cannot turn out to be very profitable.

Concerning FH thread/method, please take just care. Besides FH's attitude of kicking off his threads anybody asking questions..., there is quite a wealth of evidence around (public, but mostly private... and then shared behind the curtains, as the guy doesn't allow us to make it publicly) that the "accuracy" (win/loss ratio) of those consolidation areas is not terribly better than your simple breakouts, and therefore I would not expect those consolidation breakouts giving a much higher advantage than your London BO. That's not as saying that no profitable system can be built up starting from FH's ideas, nor that he's not a profitable trader, probably introducing, explicitely or by habit, discretionary filters in his daily trading. Surely, not in the simplified and/or partially explained way he is preaching there. Your system here, Mer, teaches all of us how it is possible, with good risk management, to transform even a win/loss ratio < 50% into a profitable system. This is what is missing in several other discussions. Thank you very much!

Thank you also for the link to OrangeRoshan's thread.

Okay,

I've read through the thread and got all my indi's/ea's loaded.  Really lookin forward to taking this for a spin.

I do have one general area of confusion.  The strategy in general really fits my eye, but I'm having trouble getting the time zones straight.  All this GMT stuff coupled with daylight savings time, etc. messes me up.

What exactly is the "breakout" we're looking for.  I think I have my chart's timing setup to match Mer's but it has my boxes starting about 4:00pm CST and ending about 11:00 pm.  London open for me is 2:00 am.  So when exactly is the "London Breakout".

I've attached a screenshot with my boxes, the server time shown, a market clock and my local time.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated as to where I may have it messed up.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
Welcome to the thread and good luck with the strategy. In regards to GMT times, there is no set time you have to use, but experiment around with the times to see what fits your style of trading. I have seen people with a box an hour long and some with 6-7 hours long. I have see people limit the box to 25-30 pips max and have seen some use no limits.

The key is to form the box before the breakouts normally occur during the Frankfurt/London sessions open. Since we are back to regular GMT time now, Frankfurt opens at 1:00 am and London at 2:00 am. I have mine set for a 6 hour box from 01:00 to 07:14 GMT (the :14 insures that the 07:00 candle's data is figured in) which means my box ends right at the Frankfurt open at 1:00 am. Again, this is not set in stone so play around with it.

Remember Hot Forex is GMT -1, so whatever times you choose to use, take off 1 hour from the start, stop, and end session times.

p.s. I am still trying to get some modifications done to the EA and if/when that happens, I will put them into post #1.

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
Hey Mer, first of all i would like to thank you and your team and all that has contributed for producing this simple but reasonable EA.

it took me alot of "spanking" to realize that trading is not a fast track to be rich.. it's just another way of "doing business" you win some.. you lose some.

Some people might say "well yeah sure it makes profit.. but the drawdown.. blabla.." But some don't realize that in order for an EA to "work", it must suite the persons way of doing business/ trading.. and to be concidered as a tool, not an ATM..

if someone wants 100% wins, well might as well take the next bus to work.. don't trade. I have never heard of a businessmen who has never had a loss in his life.

how i use this EA:

1.To think and re-think the amount of R:R if i enter the market.. (the maxsizebox option as a buy/sell trigger lines vs TP targets/ SL, greater the number, greater the R:R) and still have some time to read the news..

2. I have bad internet connection (but now using VPS)... to execute 5 trades that fast in that one time (price) and trailing them..  haven't used the martingale opts yet.. R:R=1:1 and the others turns to "free trades" are good enough for me

Been getting to know it for the last 3 weeks (just watching), done 3 trades with 30-60pips per trade. unfortunately i don't have much time to trade with it, I have a business to run.. and i get scared when i see the news tab in FF filled with oranges and reds that are smack in the middle of the market hours (london especially) .. also when the market ranges a few days after a long bull/bearish trend (tends to eat SL's a lot these days, might be solved by tightening up the box size ).

Is it possible to add an option in (F7) that changes trading directions? e.g

buy only, sell only, buy and sell on the EA?

Anyway, thank you and all that has contributed to this thread again for the EA and the whole concept of using Fibo in a "newbie friendly" kind of way...

mer,people newbie here!

My broker is ibfx.au which is +10 hrs,  I am in East Africa +3 hrs which settings should i use for this strategy? I intend to trade from 5.00GMT - 8GMT which is equivalent to 8.00 a.m to 11.00 p.m local time. Tx n Gbless Nick

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
You need to ask your broker what their GMT time is and then add or subtract that number from the default times in the indicator. If they are GMT +2, then you add two hours. If they are GMT -2, then subtract two hours.

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
mer, they say their servers are at +0 GMT. So does the settings 6.00, 9.14 and 04.30 apply? i am testing H1, coz M15 too "loud" for me. Tx n Gbless Kish

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
It just means you don't have to add or subtract any time from the indicator times, so 5:00 GMT is 5:00 GMT. The times in the indicator are just the default times, you can experiment around and try out whatever times you feel comfortable with. You can try it on a 1 hour timeframe if you wish. I've always used 15 minute, so I can't tell you how it will work out.

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
hi mer,  progressing well on demo, just a thought...suppose you were to use trailing stop for this strategy, rather than moving stop losses as targets are hit, what would it be based on, me thinking of % of box size. want to take care of times when targets are not reached on ranging market which has been a profit killer with support from martingale.  Thanks in advance,  Kish for Africa.

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
I'm sure that could work, you just have to experiment and find out what works best. Just try not to trail too close as you want to make sure the trade has room to breathe.

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
Hello mer,

Thanks for the great EA! My question is:

What are the correct settings for the SL? I would like to set the SL to BE when I'm 10 pips in profit?

Is this the correct setting:

Breakevenprofitinpips = 1

Move rampaging factor = 10

or

Breakevenprofitinpips = 10?

Please help! 10 is the correct entry for a 5 pip brokers?

Kind regards

H

Since i'm not overly comfortable trading this method, mainly due to my lack of funds, i think i'm going to just enter and the buy or sell signal and sell at the first target every day. My stop loss will be half way between the buy and sell signal. Of course i will have my losing days but it looks to me that i'd come out in profit most days.

Might even trail my stop?

Thanks for sharing!

I am not sure about the EA you are talking about, but the simple London Breakout strategy should have you in a nice profit today. The problem in EA's is that they don't always work. A manual trade would have you in profit at this time 16:15 GMT.

HedgeGuy ,I experienced what you just mentioned . I set the EA   3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3b.mq4 on the live account in the morning today . Both Buy and Sell orders were enabled . When I came home late  in the evening I saw that  EA opened a Sell order at 1.58211,  but the EA failed to close the order at 1.58573 and it also failed to open a Buy order at that time .Computer was on and running as usual , I dont know what prevented the EA from working regularly .Pic is attached .

Good Luck everybody.

Interesting looking stuff

1. here is an interesting approach to setting the box based on identifying the low volatility overnight period using atr. Doing it on a 5 min chart I find it is more likely to avoid missing drawing the box after the breakout has started. Running it back the atr cross back up over the ema of the atr can happen any time between 0330 and 1000 gmt
http://forex-strategies-revealed.com...eakout/cpage-9

2. I have not read the complete thread yet so apologies if this has been addressed by the ea coders already. With regard to writing an ea you have to be picky about placing pending buy and sell stop orders if they are close to the current price or you will get errors. Many metatrader brokers won't let you place a pending order, take profit or stop within a defined number of pips of the current price (determined by stoplevel parameter - usually about 2 pips for eurusd). In this kind of breakout strategy there are 5 possible entry prices depending on where current price is when you place your order

a. price is inside the zone by more than the stoplevel - place a simple pending stop buy or sell order

b. price is inside the zone but within the stoplevel value of the edge of the zone (i.e. 1 or 2 pips from the edge of the zone) - this would give an error if you just placed the pending stop order above so in this situation place it at the current price plus + stoplevel instead. You are deliberately slipping yourself but only a little.

c. price is on edge of zone - probably easiest to just place a market order

d. if you are using the method described in the link above you can have price outside the zone by the time the zone forms. If price is very close to the edge of the zone you have the option of placing a market order or placing a limit order a distance equivalent to the stoplevel away.

e. if price is outside the zone by more the the stoplevel amount you have the option of placing a market order and sucking up the slippage or placing a limit order at the edge of the zone and hoping it retraces to fill you

I don't know enough mql to code this but having worked with coders on expert advisers I know to my cost it is a problem that will lead to errors and missed trades if it is not dealt with,.

I wonder if there is a way to make this ea to place only 1 trade per BO, and to stop at TP1 if hit, if it doesnt hit and goes to the other side then close at stop loss and martingale to the other TP1.

Im trying to use the "users guide" of the EA but I have no idea of what im doing.

This BO system is great btw!

Hi Mer,

i've looked all over the thread and at the attachments top right but I can't see whether the new EA was updated with your idea of larger lot sizes with the first of the 5 corrective trades so as to diminish outr mart risk?

Did this ever happen. Are you still using this sytem and is it still so profitable for you. Would appreciate a reply thanks

Hi everyone, m a newbie in forex. I tried London Breakout, its really very good and helpful. Just little confusion. Is there any update or any other indicator that can give auto-execution and fill-out of trades as soon as the price meets the target.

HI guys,

new to this.

Did you ever consider  30min TF as this would likely give a smaller box as the 0800 bar tends to be big. Can I alter the ea to reflect timeframe 0400 - 0730 and will everything else build as normal based on the potential smaller box?

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
Hi, I have (long ago) experimented with this ea and used half hour bars from just after midnight so I believe that you can do the same

--- 帖子 #1288 ---
Thank you. The strategy is interesting. But there is a good way to use the Martingale method of trading on the turn. Landmark reversal find on the data from multiple oscillators. Input can not be accurate. Therefore, we will need the Martingale method. The M5 through step 20 pips open no more than 6 orders. It is a bit on such a small distance.

It is safe even for small deposits.

Has anyone tried? Share your experience.

Hi Mero,

I hope i'm not double posting as i just tried to post but it didnt seem to appear?

Thanks for a great system and strategy, it is excellent for a newbie like myself to learn entries, exits, t/p and s/l levels.

I had a question as i cant seem to find an answer on your thread?

Say you enter long or short at the respective level and are now deep in the profit zone. Do you use or have a strategy for re-entering on say, a pullback or reversal or do you wait for the candle to close back inside the buy/sell area? If this is the case how do you deal with entering on say a major trend reversal that starts in the profit zone?

Any help on this would be most apreciated.

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
Greetings everyone!

It has been sometime since I have posted, but I am hopeful that someone who is familiar with this strategy and the coding within would be willing to assist me. Using the v1.3b version of the EA which I can provide, I would like to find someone that could change some of the code for me. I have made the request from Squalou, but I think he is busy as I have not heard from him for sometime. He would be perfect as it's his coding.

I wanted the StartTime, EndTime, and SessionEndTime fields to be changed from time values to calculations where number of candles are chosen instead of a time value.

When placed on a chart, it immediately creates the box and be open for trading with the following user defined variables in place of the current time variables.

StartTime would be ‘x’ number of candles in the past from current candle when EA is loaded on a chart (default 8 candles)

EndTime would be current candle (if 0) or ‘x’ number of candles in the past (default 1 for previous candle close)

SessionEndTime would be’x’ number of candles in the future from current candle

Once the EA is placed on a chart, it will follow the rules of the EA as it is written. Once the SessionEndTime is reached, it will no longer trade until it is reloaded on the chart.

What I was noticing that when letting it run on it’s own, there would be times when conditions were not good for trading. I would rather watch for periods of stability in the market and load the EA manually and let it trade for that period of time in which I loaded it. I hope that made sense.

Let me know what you think and thank you,

I am willing to hire the programmer to perform this. I would rather "keep it in the family" with someone who is already familiar and we can share it on this thread if my theory is correct, than to have to pay someone to write it from scratch.

I am trading this and my results can be found here: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/ibth...reakout/485805

I call it my own LBO to differentiate from the posted EA only because I am having to close the trades manually and correct some of the false re-entries myself. I believe if it can be loaded manually as described above, it could be traded more profitably.

Guys, I don't know whether are there any member still find this thread useful. In my own way of thinking, this strategy is incredible. Easy to understand, manage and develop. The best thing that I realise in this strategy is the way we manage money, open order and martingle (This one is like dragon, I think. If u know how to control it, u will be the most powerful soldier. If not, well, dinner is deserved... Lolz ). Believe me, after back test and forward test, this strategy goes well.

However, I just realised something interesting that I would like to share. This strategy and EA has one disadvantage if you only trade 1 pair like me. That is, when we are in down trend for example, it will be very risky if you set buy order, and vice versa for up trend with Sell order. So, I use Ichimoku to define when to allow the EA to go short or long only.

I use original Ichimoku indicator in MT4, and I use this thread to overlay ichimoku to 15m chart.http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=354512

That's it. If ichimoku shows me that the market is on the down trend, I will allow the EA to set short order only, and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #1298 ---
I been trading similar to this for years and you way over complicating things. Simply wait until around 8.15 am (UK) by which time most orders have been filled giving direction. Look for a break out from the Asian session and take a quick 15 - 20 pips. Get out before 9.30 am when major news releases come out Simple.

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
yeah, I have tried your setup, I works really well I must say. Like I said, this strategy is so powerful. So, u can setup whatever u want as long as it makes u feel comfortable.

By the way, how many pairs do you trade in your system?

And I'm sorry that I make it more complex. For me, it looks clear when combine this strategy with Ichimoku.

From my own experience, it works fine with EURUSD and GBPUSD.... It depends on the time you set your box as well. If you strictly follow the original time from 1st thread, I suggest EURUSD and GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
By the way, guys, I just realise one thing, what will happen for Martingale sequence if the EA accidentally closed? Will it look back to the history or just reset to the beginning of sequence instead?

Really hope to receive the answer from you!

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
very interesting, do we have to download the time difference? like for GBPJPY?

--- 帖子 #1306 ---

Hi Guys,

Can let me know what is the latest version of the London Breakout system and where can I find it.

The last version I have is the  "3 Tier London Breakout V.3.2b.mq4".

Is this the latest one?

Thanks

DP

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
Hello guys ...... ie there anyone can delete the function of " reentry " from the expert? or at least make an option to enable it or disable it ??? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
Thanks sir for such wonderful EA,

It's awesome. I am working from last 2 days. Quite interesting. I collect 30 pips in both days.

I have problem with entry point. Can this EA will open a trade on ( entry point + spread + 1 pip ) for long & ( entry point - spread - 1 pip ) for short. Have any setting in EA for such a entry ?

Otherwise this EA works Great. Plz reply as early as possible.

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
Hi I must first say I am very impressed with the London Break Out EA.  I have tested it on MT4 and it shows to be a promising system for my needs.  I would like to request confirmation that I have the system set up correctly.

I have downloaded the following files:
London Breakout Full Trading Package.zip
3 Tier London Breakoutv3.2.mq4
3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3b

I followed the following steps to set it up:
1.  Loaded the indicators and scripts from the London Breakout Full Trading Package.zip into the corresponding MT4 folders
2.  Replaced the 3 Tier London Breakoutv3.1.mq4 with the 3 Tier London Breakoutv3.2.mq4 file in scripts
3.  Placed the 3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3b into MT4 experts folder
4.  Applied the London BreakoutV9.1 indicator to the chart and entered my session times in the inputs
5.  Executed the 3 Tier London Breakout v3.2.mq4 script on the same chart

6.  Applied the 3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3b EA to the same chart and adjusted my input settings as desired

Can someone please confirm I have set this up correctly or if I have not advise me on what I have missed.    I am very grateful for any comments or assistance.

Hi im new here, i have question how to set up EA for this london break out (3 Tier London Breakout.mq4) Im trying to set it up for a week and still nothing :/

--- 帖子 #1313 ---
One of the Amazing breakout strategy ..

i am new here. ...

Anyone still using this system..

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
I am also interested in this system. I downloaded the indicator where start and end time for the box is set to "06:00" and "09:14" by default while in the description of the system in Post 1, they are said to be "05:00 GMT0" and "08:00 GMT0". I also do not know what is the purpose of the SessionEndTime input parameter. However, if this strategy is still profitable, I would like to re-implement an EA to automate it.

--- 帖子 #1315 ---
Hi MathTrader7,

Apologies for my english.

By using this indicator i would get much more pips but again not always profitable. i am not using martingale sequence to recover the loss and only one trade a day. maybe that's why losses in some months

The last month (March) was good profitable month. i got 1446 pips by (5 pending order and 5 tp  ).

My settings is box set GMT 1:00 to 5:55 (not 6:00)

I also don't know the purpose of SessionEndTime i just set london close time 15:00.

This is was last three days trades..

April 1-3

Gained 569+ pips ..  (by NFP spike on Friday)

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
Hi amit30884, thanks for your reply .

It seems to be still a profitable strategy. I may start writing an EA to automate it.

Just two questions:

1) Are you using the EA in the first post? or you just use the indicator?

2) What is the GMT time difference of your broker?

Best,

MT7

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
Hi MT7 ! Good to see you here mate ! I like any BO bots too. The TO - so it seems - isn't interested anymore in this method ? Or does he use it day by day successful in manual trading ? So an EA to have would be quite interesting !

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
I did a visual backtest on EURUSD M15, and it seems to be a promising approach. Without Martingale it sometimes loses, but on average it was profitable during last month (March 2015). There is only one day (25th of March) that price jumped 48 pips:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and depending on your broker it may be a profitable, breakeven, or loss trade. I'm going to implement an EA to trade according this strategy without Martingale in the first version.

--- 帖子 #1319 ---
1)  Trading manually by using the indicator.

2) My broker is GMT0 (exness)

i have been some problems when using the EA on the first post..

--- 帖子 #1320 ---
Which probs did you have using that bot posted in #1 ? ... could you describe them ? I think that sould be perhaps important for MT7 developing his own EA !

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
Hi, i have a problem with EA and script. Other indicators works well. Can you help me?

--- 帖子 #1322 ---
Not have deal with EA before so i don't know how to exactly back-test ..

This is the error i was getting when testing..

--- 帖子 #1323 ---
Back test from Jan. 2014 to the end of March 2015:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Note: I created an EA for this strategy without Martingale. In above BT, the EA opens 5-positions with 5 different TP levels at breakout levels.

--- 帖子 #1324 ---
Is that the BT from post #1 in this thread .... I think so ?

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
No, it doesn't work in my platform. I just created an EA that trades according to the strategy in Post 1 without Martingale.

--- 帖子 #1326 ---
Ahh ... that's quite important ! So will you share your last creation ?

--- 帖子 #1327 ---
I will upload the EA later since I just created it to examine the performance of the system, the code is kind of messy

--- 帖子 #1328 ---
Hey. I am looking at the strategy as well. Seems very solid so far. I will forward test on a demo for a while and post results.

Best, Josh

Edit-sorry, but i cant get any of the EAs to work with my mt4

--- 帖子 #1329 ---
I think the reason for that could be easy: these bots are coded with older then 765 MT4-builds we presumably all use here !

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
It could be the problem. Can someone recode it?

--- 帖子 #1331 ---

You never did upload your version of the EA.....would you be kind enough to dig out and upload?  I know you have many other projects your working on.

--- 帖子 #1334 ---
I stopped further developing of that EA. It is a basic version to test the idea by backtesting. It is not suitable for trading on demo/live accounts yet.

With GBPJPY, an extra opportunity for a good profit. This broker is IFCMarket. A profit/loss with trailing EA was used. Will be testing 3 different settings with this EA with two more brokers, FXDD and FxOpen to compare the setting. For your reference, am zipping them. Have a nice weekend.

Hello Toppo and all!

I have been trying a maybe earlier version of the London BO Indi (v9.1) by Squalou. The version in this thread looks more advanced, with TP points.... I have been trying to find a working EA for the strategy for 2 weeks, but I cannot find anything that works...

You mentioned that you do have the EA and you were using it. Would you mind posting it? The one in the 1st post has an errorapparently, because when I try to activate it I get "'3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3b' is not expert and cannot be executed"

Your sharing is much appreciatted. Best of luck!!

--- 帖子 #1376 ---
Fixed!!

This problem is fixed by

Removing or commenting the line
#property show_inputs

--- 帖子 #1377 ---
Hello again,

I just began testing the EA and I'm surprised to have finally found one that apparently works and looks fine!!!

Just 2 ideas and a question:

A) One thing that I am concerned about though is that I could not find a setting to place a "buffer zone" outside the box before entering the trade.

In the originals, I could set up a margin of 5-6 pips after the box boundaries so the EA would not enter a position until it reached the end of the buffer.

Does "3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3b" have the feature and I did not see it?

If not, would it be possible to add it to the EA?

B) In the previous versions, I could actually see past setups. In this one I'm only getting the last day's.

C) I'm not attaching the Indicator, should I? When I attach it, it does show past setups,but the latest gets "dirty" with letters overimposing.

Thank you in advance!!

--- 帖子 #1378 ---
hi guys, I was reading through and following this thread extensively last year, when it was still pretty inactive since 2013.

Glad to see it has come alive again.

I did extensive backtesting using EA back in the day but unfortunately have lost most my findings from back then, however it did show up some very promising results with varied settings.

one thing was for sure tho.... if you use the martingale, there will come a point in time where it will wipe you account.

my objective has been to try and find the most safest and consistent setting that stands the test of time.

I still think this strategy is best traded manually, using price action and limited indicators to confirm breakout direction. the biggest drawback using EA is fakeouts

personally i like waiting for price to break, pull back and place order above the new high

attaching my indicators an EA's which seem to be working no problem

appreciate the rest of you guys trading the daily breakout can share the settings you are using, ie, times in gmt, and tp/sl levels

--- 帖子 #1379 ---
Hi Slumdog,

"the biggest drawback using EA is fakeouts...."

I agree about the fakeouts & change of directions.... They kind of ruin all the good trades. So, I am working on a couple of indicators to solve that problem.

(I prefer manual trading on H1. Wouldn't trust an EA).

--- 帖子 #1380 ---
If someone have problem with the EA, just edit the MQL and comment the line  Inserted Code #property show_inputs

--- 帖子 #1392 ---
hi everyone

I built a simple code to draw the london box on JForex charts to use with london breakouts strategies

If anyone interested, follow this link

--- 帖子 #1393 ---
I have been testing it with the EA for about two weeks, but there are too many false signals for my taste. Big gains if you get a big breakout, but the "fakeouts" eat up all the profit.

To catch a good breakout you could perhaps set the entry level at +50% or -50% of the box. Then you would avoid the fakeouts and only trade really big breakouts. But I don't know how to adjust the EA for that...

Hi Frankyol, today i downloaded the EA you have uploaded. Please, help me to solve this issue.....as you can see in the attached screenshot, the price has targeted all 3 targets but, for each target, it has closed the same lot size entered in the trade. In tester, It doesn't split the entry lot size! I don't know why! After a first long trade, the price has well gone down, entered in short level which 0.06 size, but for each target it closed a size if 0.06 lot! How is it possible?

Please, can you solve this issue?

...The question also is for all followers....

Thanke you.

--- 帖子 #1401 ---
Hi anypips,

I'am not author of this EA. That is not an issue, but it is a feature, I think. If you use 3x TP, set lot size to 0.02.

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
Hi Frankyiol, and thanke you for your reply.

About the question, it remain the fact that the entry size does not seem to be splitted once achieved the set take profits. Whenever lot size i set, in Backtest it doesn't split it, but close the same size each take profit level.

Do you Know which one i can contact for this EA?

Thanke you

Can anyone help me with this strategy and/or EA? The strategy itself seems fairly time consuming, I have been looking for an

EA like this.

--- 帖子 #1408 ---
Seems the forum is pretty dead but i am giving it a shot.

I trade the EA without marginale option. However on my EURO pairs (GBPUSD & EURUSD) i can trade with my maxrisk option enabled. BUT this not work on my ASIAN pairs (GBPJPY & USDJPY). It only works for these 2 pairs with a fix lot size. Anyone else noticed this?

So it if put maxrisk on my ASIAN pairs the EA wont simply take trades. It will only take trades with fixed lotsize. I know about the minilots etc.. that isnt the problem.

Hope someone can help me or point me in the right direction to make this EA work on my ASIAN pairs with maxrisk setting enabled.

So in short i want take risk size postions on my ASIAN pairs by the EA.

Thanks all.

--- 帖子 #1413 ---
thank you, this EA work well for me

--- 帖子 #1414 ---
What do you mean "remove thes line"?

--- 帖子 #1415 ---
Having issues with the indicators on the chart. However, I have discovered if you close and re-open metatrader they appear. I just usually wait until the last candle closes for the box, then close, then re-open, and everything appears. This is not referring to the EA though.

--- 帖子 #1416 ---
i can't find EA verison C

London Breakout EA v1.3c please attach it here

also is this method still working good?? can i depend on it?

and is the EA is ok and giving good results?

--- 帖子 #1417 ---
You want a complete stranger to tell you to depend on it? and then what? through some hard earned cash at it?

Common man.. use your brain, if it would work that good would anybody share it here? why? so we all can stop working?

Sorry to be so rude, nothing personal, but people should start using their brains a little more.

Build you're own EA, start learning how to code, maybe if you are very good and very lucky you find something that works.

Which for sure you will not share here, because it has taken you many years to develop.

And when all fails at least you have a new skill developed.

--- 帖子 #1418 ---
plz can you attach the modified EA I can't find these lines to modify the code

thanks

--- 帖子 #1419 ---
delete this line or comment it so the EA will work

#property show_inputs

Hey Merritt.... nice work man!

I took a look into your codes and did some mod in your entries approach.... I'm not saying that you've a problem with entry, but I refined things that I judge could be better and I've to say.... the results were very good indeed.

HI, ruben can u plz share us the settings and the latest version.

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
the EA is not work correctly in live the multiplier is not run correctly as in history work

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
Please share

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
Hi, I am very interested to test this live. I had a similar EA coded, but over the two years since 2015 it did not return so well, I think it is because it is not running properly.

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
Yes, I am about to get a Break out strategy programmed for me where you can adjust the times that the break out executes and the bars over which the pre-breakout trading range is calculated, and where the strategy is closed.  But I would be interested in seeing this one that you have updated Ruben.  I am always interested in seeing ideas for improving strategies.

From what I can see the London Breakout Strategy is one of the most common trading strategies but there are surprisingly few EA's built out of it.  At least there are surprisingly few that are available.  If you would be able to share Ruben that would be brilliant, but if not, what were the entry changes that you thought could be improved with Merritt's EA?

--- 帖子 #1426 ---
Hi Shimmering,

It looks like he means that in the code, which presumably is an .mq4 file, you will find lines of code which control how the EA works.  He is suggesting that if you remove the lines of code he describes then that particular EA he is referring to will at least run.

It would be nice if people responded a little more to each other on here!

--- 帖子 #1427 ---
Thanx all of you for your work...but I get with rubens settings this results:

Can you please post your set file?

--- 帖子 #1428 ---
does anyone try the EA live, the multiplier is not working correctly, it works only on demo account

--- 帖子 #1429 ---
Bro, i tested with default with spread 20.

Tested with spread 10 is good. if like this better use ECN with spread 0-5.

Have a look on spread 20. as the result is not that good.

hello all and the thread owner.

Any new strategy of this indicator? No version update?

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
I have been trying the original London Breakout strategy for about 7 months and have found it frustrating; the drawdowns really damage the winnings. I tried some different things to turn this around, unsuccessfully. I remembered a variation of the original strategy which took less trades but with a higher win ratio so came to look at that and came across version 2. I can’t tell you how refreshing it is to find that all my stumbling in the dark has already been experienced by others and solutions found.

I am avidly reading through Scott Merit’s posts and am keen to try this out on Monday with one pair and manually.

I would like to thank you guys for all the hard work you put into this and sharing it with bums like us who just rape your systems and moan about the EA not working. I’ll come back in 6 months and let you know how I get on.

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
Can you say where is the latest EA and Indicator for download? i cant find it. I download one ea from your journal.. but it is not work like that..

Dear frankyol

Sir, the 3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3c.mq4 entry point is at the edge of the breakout box, but I want to set the Offset for entry point from the edge of

the breakout box. For example  I want the function that I can choose or input the offset that EA can buy or sell X pips above or below the edge of the breakout box.

Could you please add this function into 3 Tier London Breakout EA v1.3c.mq4 for me sir.

Best regards,

Handycap4

Please send me the latest version and user manual of the tool London breakout EA

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1445 ---
''What we did was use the edge of the box as the new Entry Point''

I can't understand the entry point exactly. Firstly a bar crosses up the edge of the box, the next bar you will enter.

If the next bar's close is below the previous bar's high will you enter?

If the next bar's close is below the previous bar's close will you enter?

Or you will enter at the next bar's open in any case?

You dont use 1.3 rate for entry, what are the drawbacks?

If I use this system at stock market endexes have I some problems?

Thank you far all..

--- 帖子 #1446 ---
So you don't allow an entry based on the opening candle of the session? Always ignore that 1st candle?

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
Fantastic thread! Thanks to the original poster and those who helped it along the way. Finally finished reading the whole thread and did a period of backtesting and some forward testing with some awesome results. I have been trading it live (manually as I don't use MT4) across 3 pairs and have banked 49% profit in a week and a half so far! I only trade the 1st sets of each open and I multiply the next day if today loses but not using Martingale so I can use good risk per trade and the stats for multiple days of losing is so low I can use that to my advantage.

hi all, use 3 Tier London Breakout EA on CFD and 'zero divide' error appear but it work fine on forex.

Apart from the time, which you gotta set according to the broker time, what else need to be done?

Thank you

Hi all.  I am a new member in east coast USA.  As a night owl, I like to trade the London breakout.  I was wondering if there is an EA that can do the following on MT4:

1. Count back 5 candles from London open

2. If 3 of 5 candles are green, place a sell order with 30 PIP profit target on session open

3.  If 3 of 5 candles are red; place a buy order with 30 PIP target on session open

Thanks for your help in advance

--- 帖子 #1453 ---

Hi!! Why those buys at that prices? Breakout of the cloud?

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
Hello there,

There is already a function in EA that does that.

In the case of buyers, when crossing passes upper box line if Ask is greater than (upper box line price + TP1)/2 it won't trade

You have to change the marked in bold condition :

if (iClose(NULL,TFforReentry,1) <= BuyEntry && Ask >= BuyEntry && Ask < (BuyEntry+BuyTP1)/2) {

lotsToTrade = get_lotsToTrade(magic1, TP_pips,SL_pips);

_OrderSend(symbol,OP_BUY,lotsToTrade,Ask,SLIPPAGE,BuySL, BuyTP1,TradeComment,magic1,0,Blue);

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
Hello Ruben,

Could you be so kind and tell us at least some clue what you used to filter out bad trades?

Thanks

Why did this thread stop ... had and still holds potential to be a robust strategy

Why don't you share something or show anything that you've been done for FF community?

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
Am I missing something here?

--- 帖子 #1464 ---
This system seems pretty legit.  I am sure this has probably been mentioned, but could some one point me to the recommended settings for this EA or post for it.  Thanks.  I am under the impression that it has to be run on a 15 minute TF for optimum results?

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
Also it would be nice to know why EA doesn't load to chart.  My mt4 shows an error stating that this is not an expert? Any light you can shine in this would be appreciated . Thank you

--- 帖子 #1466 ---
Did you get an answer for this issue/question?

--- 帖子 #1467 ---
No reply yet. Are you getting the same issue?

--- 帖子 #1468 ---
yes have the same issue that the ea states its not a expert and unable to load

--- 帖子 #1469 ---
is it working friends?

Hey Kenwynn- any luck creating that EA?  I'm working on breakout strategies as well.  Would be happy to collaborate.  I tried sending you a PM but my account's restricted because it's new.

--- 帖子 #1472 ---
could put option to enter the order after closing the candle after the box?

--- 帖子 #1473 ---
Posting a version of the EA as revision 1.3d that fixes the error stating this is not an EA.  Also fixed some build warnings.  I have not tried to use this yet, but fixed it for my own inspection.  Please don't ask me questions about how it works, I'm just starting to figure that out myself.

--- 帖子 #1474 ---

Hi everyone, does anyone have this London Breakout Indy with no high and low ad? Many Thanks

I can't download the zip file.. anyone knows how can it be setup?.. is it a trading robot that trades for us or its guiding us what it the entry and we will follow?

--- 帖子 #1478 ---
What dates did you use for the backtest?  Wow- 53% DD. I don't think that's something anybody wants to trade, but maybe the settings just need to be optimized.

--- 帖子 #1479 ---
Hi Guys,

awsome work!!!

i was wondering if anyone has a version when price crosses the buy-sell level an arrow buffer is drawn?

--- 帖子 #1480 ---
Dont create any pending orders. Wait for the bar to close above or below box. the closing price of the bar is your trade open price.  Trade only GBPUSD ... 80% winning rate ! my 2c's

--- 帖子 #1481 ---
activetrade thanks for the info, what RR ratio do you use with the 80% winrate? how do you deal with false breakouts etc, did you backtest this over 5 years and so on?

--- 帖子 #1482 ---
Here are my results after 1 month, using a $1000 demo account, with most of the settings as described. I only take 1 trade per day per pair, and have the SL set at TP factor .5, with 15 pip min and 60 pip max boxes. I trade 0.01 lot size, with a move to Breakeven +5 pips when it hits halfway to TP. Box drawing starts at the Tokyo open (7 pm CST) and box drawing ends 15 minutes before the London open (1:45 am CST). Session ends at the London close (11:00 am CST). At one point I had it closing all trades at the London close, but not anymore.

I've got 3 sets of charts. All_Pairs isn't all 28, but a good chunk of the majors plus the European crosses. Profitable_Pairs filters out mostly the Usd and Chf pairs. Winning_Pairs is just those pairs at or above 60% win rate.

MyFxBook link:

https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/l...a-demo/9010383

I currently have 3 platforms running side by side. One as described and shown above. The next one is exactly the same except the TP factor is .75 instead of 1. The third is like the first (shown above) except it can take 2 trades a day per pair. Not 2 at the same time, but one trade, and then another re-entry trade later, after the first has closed (ran into FIFO trouble with OANDA with the triple position setting). I'm only a week or two in on those other tests.

I'm going to run it for another month before I maybe put money into it. 2 more things I'm going to test. I'm going to code it so that instead of BE+5 pips, it takes BE+ .25 TP. And then I'm going to have one session that just runs my standard settings on all 28 pairs. I will probably always have that running side by side with it, even once I go live.

Pepper...

All Pairs

Profitable Pairs

I just want to say a big thank you to Mer and Squalou and many others for the time and dedication they have contributed to the EA's and indicators and mind boggling script and strategies in this thread.  I have got it set up to backtest now, minus the martingale.  When you guys started this, I didn't even know what forex was until about 2013, lol.

Anyway, thanks again, and hopefully I can finish the final piece of the jigsaw

Hello kamran_gg!

This thread is more than a decade before, but I see you were on line lately from your profile, hence I am posting now.

I am interested in this v2 and have been quickly going over all the posts. I found your post sharing your trades on XAUUSD, which were in profit.

Which version of this EA, b, c, or d, you traded gold?

Can you recall your inpuit parameters and share with me?

Regards,

Akira
