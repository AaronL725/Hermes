(Last update of information on 23 / 05 / 2015) This thread is not to teach anything to anyone.This thread is for people who are willing to teach themselves. We are a handful of traders who trade this way this is for us to share what trades we have taken and what ideas we think might be important and to be able to answer questions about the trading in a structured way. This thread is a inspired by Genesis Matrix System This thread is a continuation of this thread where a lot of testing and learning was done. A special thank you to RJ for letting us use his system A special thank you to Strada for showing us what can be done if you apply yourself properly Thread Rules *Respect and common sense prevails.I know some people here very well and the rest I don't.If you are new be polite in the way you do things. Notes *Trading the way we do is very discretionary even though there are fixed rules to the system things like pivots,support and resistance and news is everyone's own prerogative. IT MIGHT BE A SIGNAL BUT IS IT AN OPPORTUNITY *You will notice plenty of good examples of how we trade in the first three post. The system This system is based on the Genesis Matrix System.It uses the Matrix (The squares at the bottom ) to give us an entry signal.How it works is in the Genesis thread. We wont go into detail about that.Please go read that thread. There is are Multiple Time Frame Stochastic indicators in the original template and then Strada and other prefer to use ULTRA indicators found here I don't use them anymore as I its a bit too much for me to look at but is very useful to others. The system is traded from the 30 min before Frankfurt Open to 2 hours after London Opened.It works the best on opens as that is the highest probability for a move to happen in either direction.Consolidation is this system's weak point and we must accept it and learn when it is the best to trade.It can work at anytime as long as you realize that you cant just take every color change of the matrix in slower periods. We trade either EUR / JPY or GBP / USD It doesnt really matter which you trade most of the time but there are times when one is clearly not moving well and then you have the other.I personally trade as my bread and butter the E/J and most of the time its decent.To be able to change there must be a real sign of one pair being better and they are in my opinion equal. The Entry requirements 1 - Matrix Changes color and the bar closes.This will be the signal candle (the indicator doesn't repaint ) 2 - Price improves by at least 1 pip of the Signal candle 3 - If you use the Stochastic then at least one needs to be in your direction. Now you have a signal.If you choose to use it is up to you.There is no magic answer for when to take it and when not.Know how price works and seeing the price action unfold everyday will help you will make better decisions the more experience you get with this system. IF - You decide to trade Stoploss goes above the swing high or low but its really up to you how you want to do it.Your trading the system and have to take responsibility for how many pips you risk etc. The patterns repeat themselves day in and day out.Not changing what you are looking at the whole time will train your eye.A weak craftsmen blames his tools. Exits Exits are the most important thing in trading as that is where you as a trader decide if the opportunity is still present.Exits helps use lock in profits and reduce risk by moving Stoplosses and many other things.Nothing complicated just the basics I divide my trade into 2 equal parts in order to have 2 exits.I might half the second take profit again on the second half of the trade if I think price will continue and I want to stay in the move and want to take some profits. Other traders split the size into 3 equal parts from the start and then trade accordingly.I cant speak for them so send them a PM or ask them. TP 1 = +6 or bigger TP 2 = +12 or bigger or if there is reversal signal Like I said exits are what make a trader a trader and the better you get the more confidence you will have in your decisions to leave the trade open or close it. Open trades are closed if a signal happens in the other direction and you believe there is enough cause to close or even revers your order.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
+24 and done Strada always said: "It doesn't have to more difficult than that." Today was simple.Not uncommon with this system but it can get much worse when the market starts consolidating so don't be fooled Hope you guys have a great weekend

Hi X-man Thanks for the well wishes. You are right,having it all together makes sens. You are a prime example of what can happen if you focus your energy on what is working and not change the whole time and practice practice and learn from people who know what they are doing. Hopefully I can follow along in your foot sets of being full full time soon. Hope you have a great weekend.Weather is looking good in Cape Town for this weekend All the best Rooi

Hello all I would like to share my Fridays session. * I missed a nice little move about 30 minutes prior FO but was determined not to enter late. * Entered long close to FO only to miss taking of TP1 was determined not to turn it into a loser so exited at BE * Trade 2 saw a SL adjustment 8 minutes after entry with a long signal developing 18 minutes after entry I was close to closing and reentering long. Trade 2 finally moved for a total of 39.9 for the session * Charts attached Have a good weekend Anthm

+13 and done FO tested the high although I didnt use that signal it would have made money Jumped in early on the down move and got burned but got it back and a bit more Rooi

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Not trading today as I have to take my car in to garage. Good luck and happy pipping

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi all, Rooi as you know I on holidays at the moment but did find time this afternoon. Haven't traded since my last post. Here's todays with TP 3 still on the table will make it my one and only today, (SL set at entry price minus 1 pip) Will edit final pips later , lets see if it breaks BRN or it bounces and takes me out. Regards Anthm EDIT, SL taken out obviously with a new long signal developed. anyways I done for +12.2 and 1/2 hours work. The long as I type looks nice on the FO, hope others are on it.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Anthm Hope you are enjoying your holiday and having some nice weather. Nice trading this morning.Like you said for 30 min its really great. I'm in that long with half of already and looking to see if it will pop higher. Some nice signals formed in the 1hour before FO.Which is always a good sign that the guys are looking to move the price which is great. All the best Rooi PS-Are you trading off of the hotel internet?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I like where you put your SL.Its where mine goes as well.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Nice one, For me its off to the the P apa U niform B ravo.

+20.1 for me and done

--- 帖子 #27 ---
+11 Tight overnight range especially just before the FO so instead of going for the break out each way I waited for the break and test. Not that one is better than the other just a bit slow this morning thinking wise and playing it safe.Not feeling up to risking too much. As it was a break and test it is a continuation trade and only used 1 TP so halve the risk but half the reward but still had a nice pop. Better to be in for half the risk then watch a move that would have made money Maybe looking for some more this morning Rooi

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Great Rooi, your trading and the after work --&gt; PUB cheers

--- 帖子 #29 ---
+2 and calling it a day for now Still making a lot of notes All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Haven't shared a trade in while but I do trade this everyday.Not always in the mood to post as it does take up some time. +16 and done for the day. Out at the low of the Asia session and not pushing to hard today as the ranges have been small.Just taking what I have and finishing without a headache or problem Here is how my 2 screens are setup. Left is bigger view that I use just for targets and to get on overall feel what has been happening the last two days On the right is my trading system that I use for entries and all trades are based on this chart. I could trade without the left 5min chart but like to have it there as reference and it shows me EurJpy.So on the left I can see the 4 individual currencies and what they are up to for whatever it might be worth. Hope you guys have a good weekend. All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Like pulling teeth this last two mornings on GU but not done yet.Will update later. Not always sunshine and Roses but if you want to be a trader in the good times you have to be able to do it in the bad times. Just have to wait the bad ones out till the nice ones come along again. Rooi

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Currently nursing a -4 for today and a -1 for yesterday. Packing it in for today as dont want to throw away what I dont have currently Days like today I like to re-read the story on the first post of this thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=507861 Hope you guys are doing better.EJ played nicely today but oh well Oh- All the trades except for the first one is single positions All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #33 ---
First day back and I see the low ATR,s are also back making it extremely difficult. 4 trades to finish -7.6 Lets see tomorrow Anthm

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Morning Anthm Pretty much the same as you but didn't take the long into the new high of the day. I have this rule for now about it ( of course it my rule and I'm not saying one way is better than the other just sharing what I'm doing for now) Here it is copied and pasted out of my "Rule Book" " When we have made a new High / Low for the day and we want to play the continuation then we have to wait for the retrace and breakout of the High/Low so that we have a new price that has been traded and that gives us a better chance for new higher or lower prices unless the retrace of the high and low is deep enough to give us TP1 at a decent level before testing the new high or low of the day." Here are my trades +12 First trade was 2 positions After that they were all singles Attached Image (click to enlarge) Like you said about the smaller ranges.They are hampering what we need to achieve and I remember that Strada used to trade FTSE100 and WTI using Bago so I have decided start working on the DAX (DE30) as it range is much bigger and the signals seem to work nicely I will be demo trading the DAX till at the very least 1ste Jan 2015 and will update when/if it goes live Attached Image (click to enlarge) As always thanks for sharing your trades.Glad you are back in action All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #35 ---
+7 at the moment First trade 2 positions again! Rest are just single positions Might look for some more but wont be risking more that the 7 pips I have now so at worst a Breakeven day for me.Not the best week thus far.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Lost some focus in recent days with what I though was a slow market meanwhile it was just me looking for something to blame and a reason to stay away from the trading or entering the market and using my system to its full potential. +20 thus far and looking for some more. As a day trader I need to push a bit harder We all lose some focus and its been a long year so far and we just need to keep our self and our minds strong and fit.Or am I making an excuse again? Anyway lets get busy Rooi

--- 帖子 #37 ---
+10 added Should have been long GU There is no knowing winners and loser before they happen

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Did away with the higher time frame chart on the left. Doesn't serve me any real purpose.Just one more step in the inking process that can be removed.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Nice work Rooi, nice trading. No entries for me today still not feeling right about the low ATRs and looking at other ideas. Rooi could I kindly ask how you write and draw on your charts,for example the short horizontal lines you draw that may extend for 10 or 15 candles only rather than the whole chart. Also the super big question mark. ? I see you have a separate small window on the bottom called line studies is this the secret? Kind regards Anthm

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks anthm Finished on + 40.Very decent session. Training myself and brain to be more confident and trust the edge and its positive effect as well as cementing the rules down for next year. Next years target is + 50pips a day with it being 3% of account equity In the screenshot attached you will see the toolbars drop down menu and you will see "line studies"selected with a tick. Then in teh picture you will see the first big red arrow that point to some small lines.You can left click and drag it or right click and it will give you options. The rest is on the screenshot. We have a great recipe here for making pips just need to practice and believe and practice some more then we will get there. Less is more. Hope you will start trading again soon as well. All the best Rooi PS - I use Microsoft Paint as well to draw on the "screenshot"itself as well like in the picture attached

--- 帖子 #41 ---
+38 Unfortunately I lost my nerve on the EJ short.Anyway making notes and there was plenty of opportunity to get some more All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Made 11 on the GU long side but I have my fill for the week and feeling horrible Working on something else for today.Will be back on Monday and ready for action. All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Nice early finish for the day and week. +28 ( 14 X 2 ) Some really nice heavy buying so took both TP's at 14.It might run some more but happy with what I have. Working on trying to stretch the good ones for more profit if possible but not always easy. No trade on EJ as the big German news Not risking anything more Rooi

--- 帖子 #44 ---
+28 and done Just 2 trades today as I was a bit busy with family stuffs. 1 loser and 1 winner 5 signals and of those 4 were winners and 1 a loser. Not posting as much as I want here but have a journal on my computer that I update everyday. Might try posting more in the new year but for now just once a week if possible Rooi

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Just shy of 100 pip move. Posted a couple in the other thread and thought I'd post this one as its clear to see that I could have waited for the color change on the matrix to exit. Strada posted other big trades of 100 pips and more in the past. Its just trusting yourself and trusting the system. Hope to catch one or two of these in the new year. Rooi PS - still running lower as I'm typing

--- 帖子 #46 ---
+ 23 and done Rooi

--- 帖子 #47 ---
+24 and done Only traded EJ this morning but I have and will for the next at least 12 months crunch the numbers for both Pairs even though I I might only trade 1 and might also add DAX but its still a bit much for me.Less is more. Rooi

--- 帖子 #48 ---
+15 (just the one trade) Finishing up for the Day,Week,Month.Not in the mood to risk it here. Great weekend to all Rooi

--- 帖子 #49 ---
+ 16 on GU EJ was the easy one but GU had double the overnight range of EJ so went with GU.Doesn't matter anyway.I can only do the best with what I decide at the time. Nice and early finishes today as I'm not looking to push to hard this month.Plenty of things to finish elsewhere before I finish up on the 20th of this month. Rooi

--- 帖子 #50 ---
+29.8 ( 14.9 X 2) Done for the day.Cashed both TP's at 14.9 Rooi

--- 帖子 #51 ---
No the best day but not risking any more. +11 Rooi

--- 帖子 #52 ---
-1.8 with loads of crappy signals that were going nowhere and plenty of signals and color changes of the matrix. Some days are easier than other.When looking at the chart I can see that I didn't do anything wrong but the opportunity was not there today like other days. GU had better overnight range and even looked better but stuck with EJ.Last time GU disappointing when it had the bigger range,just proving that you cant really predict which one is going to move the best.Just have to make the most of what you choose. Not trading further today as previously stated. Rooi

--- 帖子 #53 ---
+14 and done for the week (7 X 2) GU this morning with a bigger overnight Range than the EJ and it worked out nicely +69 pips for the week with about 2 hours trading each morning at most.Will ramp it up again next year and see how hard we can push it. A good weekend to all Rooi

--- 帖子 #54 ---
+19 and done.Working on a little side project EJ very volatile and going into a range.I'm weary of this beast when its like that...... Rooi

--- 帖子 #55 ---
+12.3 and done. Traded single exit strategy today because I have been more relaxed with it lately but must focus on going for the bigger targets again of more than +12 and I can only really do that with a partial exit strategy. Not the best result for today , could have had more as exit could have been better but happy with the results for first proper day back at trading the year.- I want to try and journal a bit better this year for my own reference. Trade 1 +7.9 Went against me but not too much.Would have closed if it went lower. MPM = +21 MNM = -6.6 2Exit postions would have worked well with this trade. Trade 2 -6.8 Stopped out.Nothing wrong here MPM =+3.8 MNM = -6.8 Trade 3 -6.8 Jumped the gun here and I knew it but very tricky place. REMEMBER , it always better to wait for that fraction of a better price with a new high price to show as it increases the odds but it part of the system.Signal was just about there.Could have handled it better MPM = 0 MNM = -6.8 Trade 4 +6.1 Summed it up perfectly.Waited for the new higher price and entered. MPM = 6.5 MNM = 0 Trade 5 +6.8 Standard trade.Would have worked well with 2 TP's MPM = +15.2 MNM = -3.9 Trade 6 +5.1 Perfectly executed and nice follow through on the signal. 2TP's would have played nicely MPM = +25 MNM = -1.2 Rooi NOTE : MPM -&gt; M aximum P ositive M ovement ; MNM -&gt; M aximum N egative M ovement

+ 18.5 and done Trade 1 = + 9.6 Perfect entry MPM = +22.3 MNM = -2 MCC = +11.7 Trade 2 = +4.2 Standard entry on signal,SL placed well.A bit of bashing up and down and decided to exit at WS2 as resistance MPM = + 26.6 MNM = - 7.2 MCC = - 3.6 ; 14 Trade 3 = + 4.7 Nice entry.Careful of news and exited because of it. MPM = 54 MNM = 5.9 MCC = 31 MCC = M atrix C olor C hange as exit Today was nice. So for the first 3 signals were all good which is always nice and not as uncommon as one would think. Only took out about 25% of what was offered today so continuing to monitor and gathering data and giving myself a better idea of what to expect and when based on some hard figures as well There is much more to collect and I can only truly learn to gather it all with enough experience and confidence building in order to hold for the bigger targets Rooi

3.2 so far. Trade 1 = - 13.6 ( -6.8 * 2) Good sell.Part of the game MPM = +2.3 MNM = - 7.9 MCC = -7.9 Trade 2 = +10.1 ( 10.1 * 1) Bought single position as it was a signal going into news. Now in hindsight we can see that we would have got a nice entry with 2 positions if we waited but then we might have missed the big move for the news so might look at a possible scenario for adding in the second position if there is a retrace and a safe opportunity to do so. MPM = +39.4 MNM = - 6.5 MCC = +29.8 Trade 3 = + 5.9 ( 5.9 * 1 ) Sold single position with news and LO in 3 min so weary. Closed for 5.9 on TP 1 normal target as this really is more of a retrace setup.I like to see a Failure To Return bar or pattern to give me more confidence in a reversal.Its been a strong push and expecting it to re-test the high ( but I need to just follow the matrix signals ) MPM = +11.3 MNM = -1 MCC = +1 Trade 4 = - 9.2 ( 9.2 *1 ) Really sh!tty area to be trading after such a nice run up.Always difficult and whippy so just one TP MPM = +0.6 MNM = -10.5 MCC = - 10.5 Trade 5 = 10.2 ( 10.2 * 1 ) Like said in previous trade really bad area so close to the high of the day and sitting so close to the DP. MPM = 16.8 MNM = 2.9 MCC = +9.2 Rooi

Hi Rooi - one nice post deserves another I found a template from around this time last year and applied it to the Dax.....it picked up that 100 pt rally nicely Best Islander

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Captain Thank you for stopping by.Always love your posts. Yes plenty of development last year I am happy to see you are still killing the DAX and I am happy to report the EJ is back to her old self with really nice ranges of bigger than 100 pips most days I pop in frequently to your thread to make sure I'm not missing out on any magix All the best Rooi

+ 8.7 and done - Missed my money maker today Trade 1 = - 6 New daily high formed and it was a continuation trade as well as news not to far away so only 1 TP MPM = + 0.7 MNM = - 6 MCC = -6.8 Trade 2 = +7.6 Reversal of the days high so for and nice clean signal shortly after news so 1 TP MPM = +18 MNM = -2.7 MCC = +3 Trade 3 = -6.6 Buy into Resistance so 1 TP MPM = +3 MNM = -6.6 MCC = -6.6 Trade 4 = -6.1 Sell into lows on signal and weary of going into a ranging area here and 1 TP. Entered after the retrace or Failure To Return Bar which I like to trade against. MPM = +2.8 MNM = - 6.1 MCC = - 6.1 Trade 5 = +7.2 Sell again after news and LO.Waited for the new price lower for the range. MPM = +13.2 MNM = - 3 MCC = + 3 Trade 6 = +7.9 Buy into previous heavy resistance and multiple levels MPM = +8.8 MNM = - 4.2 MCC = 1.1 Trade 7 = + 4.7 ( Sh!tty fill IMHO but it happens ) + ( Should have tried to squeeze a bit more out of this trade as it did have lot going for it.Oh well) Sold a tad late on the signal but waited for a slightly lower price to give a bit of confidence to direction but it can be a disadvantage as well bus scarifying the 2 pips instead of 1pips MPM = 29 MNM = -1.5 MCC = 10.2 Rooi

-1.8 and a headache this morning.Looking for another signal maybe 40.9 pips for the week and 4 winning days out of 5. Trade 1 = +7.8 Normal sell on signal MPM = 13.5 MNM = - 1.6 MCC = 5.6 TIT = 14min Trade 2 = -7.2 Bought the sinal reversal off the low of the day so far.Brought the break of the LH.

-1.4 and done for today. I'm feeling sluggish and EJ is like a beast this morning (Not that I mind when I'm up for it but when I'm not it can be scary) Finished my 2nd week positive week for the year.My biggest goal for the year is not to have one negative week for the year with this system. Today's EJ will most probably print 200pips for the days range but I dont feeling like taking any further risk with it. Trade 2 and 3 went nicely into profit and I dint close and then its very painful to close for a loss.With ranges like now SLs need to be big and its too much of a head ache today Good weekend to all Rooi

Last weeks round up. +19.8 for the week. Although I had several days where I just scraped into profit I still ended on a positive week.

+30.2 and done Trying to push ever harder.Started early and had two losers after watching the 2 winners.Is how it goes. All in all happy with today trading and pushing harder everyday!!! 100pips a day is the goal but think that will only be possible once I start trading with 2 TP's again yet very happy with what I got at the moment with the 1TP. There was a 100pipper in the session and many in the previous days.Just happy with taking +20 on a move for now and dreaming about the +100 in the coming years. Plenty of time to work on this as system as I will most probably trade it for at least the next 10years if all goes well. Done with extensive journalling for now.Have the data that I wanted Rooi Power Cut here in Cape Town and trading from my laptop and a dongle.South African Rand is a nice short at the moment,yet I am permanently short the Rand because I keep my monies in USD and GBP.Anyway.All the best to my countrymen who deal with this same problem.

Just undone yesterdays positive pips and not to worried about it.There are good times and sh!t times and days with shit trades from which we learn.Especially on the 1min charts.Its what we do when we lose that matter.Winnings easy Lest see if I get another setup or two for today.

Hi IP No probs When the Candles close in a "big way"over the MA is the best way I can put it.But that is what I look at.Look at attached squares that I drew in yellow. I have to run but if still unclear just let me know and I will try and explain better All the best Rooi

should have let my last trade run ... but positive finish

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Very nicely done sir I traded with 1 TP for a while yet 2TP's give you that bit extra to scale out with to go for the bigger targets

--- 帖子 #103 ---
+ about 5 pips but after commissions down about 5 pips for total of the day Could have gone better.Not the easiest day but far from being the worst Rooi

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Rooi So whats your conclusion?? Best to have 2 TP's or one?? I must admit I quite like taking that first half off on first initial push then move stop so that if it takes me out its a BE net effect. This way you don't have to move stop to your actual entry so my trade can breathe a little more but if it goes against you its a net BE trade...Does that make sense?? Whats your thoughts???

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I do that too as I like the idea of it when targeting the bigger moves Seems like you are doing well,congrats Rooi

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Rooi, here's a pic of the DOW futures cfd at cash open 09.30 est, it does tend to make its mind up within 2 or 3 signals and produce a decent move. First trade was around 20 ticks , but didn't move my TP level up quick enough before been taken out. all the best

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Nice trading Remove the TP order.I found it to create this problem that happened to you plus it make mes lose focus of what happening because then I have a TP and SL in place and the trade can take car of itself is the notion but then you dont concentrate well enough.You could have killed it if you scaled out the first trade but I know you know that.Always have a SL but a TP is bad for the way we want to do things Let see what today brings.Good luck sir. Rooi

should have held for more, but it started to reverse at FO so took the points on offer then, but new it would at least hit the upper bound of the range. it's split over two 24" monitors all the best

Thats me done for today.Like to finish early on a Friday as you all know A little earlier than normal today but I do have a intra-week system as well and was monitoring closely after retraces across the board yesterday and then this Euro weakness started to show its head again. Hope you guys have a good weekend Rooi

--- 帖子 #119 ---
took some heat on this but was my own fault as I bought it as it appeared to clear a pivot. have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Nicely done mate I have done it many times in the past but my rule for it works like this : If there is not 4 pips or more between the signal and the pivot , I MUST WAIT FOR THE PIVOT TO BREAK and then it must be a decent break so that stops can go just a little below the swing or retrace that falls below the pivot.Does it always work? Not always but it works often enough that with those rules in place that the odds are I'm my favor when taking those specific setups. Remember the same setups happens the whole time and we must have specific rules in place for each setup. (It takes time to find these rules and you must make them for yourself as well.You are going to be using this system for the next 20 years so one must master it completely ) Enjoy your weekend Rooi

--- 帖子 #121 ---
thanks Rooi, many thanks much appreciated. It was a pre-coffee hasty decision, it broke the pivot by a pip or two, but it wasn't convincing to be honest and there's normally a retest after a good move which I could take anyway. banked that lesson. cheers

nice one Rooi Was a little nervous this morning , I suppose I was expecting the market to be very quiet given there was no news scheduled. I need to hold a bit and keep a target in mind whilst in the trade i.e. recent high or lows/pivots , s&amp;r. cheers and good luck

--- 帖子 #126 ---
+46 in about 25min in front of the chart Wish I could say it was skill but I have taken many of these that both go against me and go for me.At the end of it all its about following the signal and making winners bigger than losers Even saying that.Pretty Damn lucky this morning.Even nailed it to within 2 pips of the spike high's top. Gary Player said : " The harder I practice,the luckier I get " Rooi

Nice, took the same trade out at 19 pips, missed the spike. It was down to a scheduled BOJ press conference that started at 06:30 EDIT : added pic

--- 帖子 #131 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I agree.Every day when I am done making my pips I sit and take and make notes till about 4 hours after LO and work on the different ways of being in the trades. It helps growing the confidence. I always think about the huge amount of negative experience one has had learning and going through a lot of pain and mistrust in everything.We need to rewire ourself for a long time and the the upside becomes exponentially bigger in my opinion Takes time just repeating the same old same old patterns and actions

Not my best trading day ever but really trying to force myself to start trading longer hours and identifying more opportunities as and when they come along so I can really look to do very well on the really good days and not just sit and watch really nice moves happening.Missed the nice long and failed to get into the move and working on perfecting that area of my trading with this system Done for today.Slightly positive pips wise but my commissions dragging me just under BE for today.Still 3 more days in the week. Rooi

--- 帖子 #156 ---
well done, one clear winner per week is all you need. I see the long you missed, it was tricky as it was at the top of the range, think I would have skipped that one. I skipped one yesterday (I think) under the same circumstances it was at the top of range that went on to have a good run. It's always tricky dont think there is an answer to overcome it apart from maybe getting the signal, waiting for the level to break and going in late. all the best. EDIT : pic attached the blue line is former support that I thought would act as new resistance so didn't take the long (yellow arrow)

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I completely agree. You trading the DOW today ? Rooi

Yes it played nicely thanks.Done for today as it drying up for now and have one or two things that need my attention. Let hope the month keeps going like this.Cant see why it wont. See you tomorrow Rooi

Break even day today for me - took a bit of a loss early in the session and have been clawing my way back. Done for the day. EURUSD - first trade was a loss I let run a little too long (was eating dinner). Playing catch up all night. http://i.imgur.com/2ooiEP5.png GBPUSD http://i.imgur.com/cAwJyEI.png EURJPY http://i.imgur.com/SD76K31.png Need to learn to stick to pairs which have given me more success, and cut the loser short when a reverse signal has been shown.

nice move on the DOW at NY open. Managed to click sell 'EUR/JPY' instead on my trade manager console....doh, over 100 ticks missed

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Thats me done for the day and week as my I my wife has a long weekend away from work and has commanded my presence tomorrow so no charts for me Clearly at a decent resistance area and not in the mood today to see if it will give way although it certainly looks like it Hope you guys caught some of this Have a good weekend Rooi

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Nice trading Yes , is always difficult when trading more that one pair.I have done this in the past and for me personally its better to just trade one and get in the flow with it but each to their own. Thank you for sharing your trades Rooi

--- 帖子 #192 ---
That really unlucky but im sure you will get it next time.Plenty of those moves left for the rest of the year

--- 帖子 #193 ---
+11 so far but may trade the LDN open, we'll see. Enjoy your break. all the best.

Nice exit Good luck for the rest of the session All the best Rooi

another 100 tick move on the DOW, this time shaken out of first two trades and then closed third far to soon.

Tough day so far :S Three wins and two losses, but my losses have been on full positions and the second halves of my winners have not been running so currently down Might look at NY open to break even and call it a day. Edit Today's Trades Attached Image (click to enlarge) The biggest issue for me right now is that my losing trades take a full loss, whilst my winners take half profit, and the 2nd half doesn't really run. Any tips?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi. You are right your R:R is wrong.Moslty because you try to trade too many time in one Matrix Color Change Cycle.I try to trade once and when the Martix changes and then try and see how far it will run. I would have only take trades marked with yellow arrows and the last trade R:R is completely wrong and I wont be able to trade it and new Lower Lows were formed so I would need to see good PA for Longs

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi Rooi, Thanks for the help, however what makes the one marked in green not a valid trade? Understand what you are saying for Matrix Color change cycles and the PA for the bad trades . Whoops, this is the 2nd trade in the matrix color cycle as well. I understand! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hopefully recover it tomorrow and call it another profitable week.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Once you test the setups for a while with just taking the first trade after color change then you can see which work better and when its best to try and have a go further along the move Im sure you will make it back tomorrow Rooi

Just over BE so far for the day

Me for the week. Lack of posting due to the fact that I go through phases regarding posting and spending time on FF as it can be a distraction a lot of time. One of the main reasons for my posting is to keep a journal of progression for myself to check back on in one year from now and if I post once or twice a week that's enough for me plus working on a new project away from Forex and finance so need to spend some time elsewhere. Early finish today as I always try to do that on Friday Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will be including,once a month a screenshot of roughly today one year ago from my previous thread into this thread so it can become a part of it and easy to reference.Still used to use the Stochs and 15 EMA this time last year Attached Image (click to enlarge) Good weekend to all Rooi

--- 帖子 #211 ---
+33 and done for today. Should have been more.4 simple signals today that all went to TP2 Rooi

--- 帖子 #212 ---
well done Rooi. nicely done. signals were clean today points in them all. +20 for me , late in to the market, looks as though I should have held my last short ....doh. why is it never perfect

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Stricky Thanks,the same to you Nice first day back at trading This time next year you/we will be much closer to perfect Rooi

--- 帖子 #214 ---
-10 today only one trade a long later on. I didn't like the short price cycles earlier, up down, up down so kept out until I saw some volume. yellow arrow shows potential long but the price moved so quick couldn't get an entry on the next candle before it was to close to the resistance area.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
-30 but still in with a fighting chance as I was very close to my daily DD limit but managed by the grace of the fx gods to sneak in a winner and so it keeps me in the game for another 1 or 2 trades Personally a shit day for me trading as I have been sick since Sunday and woke up to no power this morning (and could not have my cofee ) and trading off my laptop and internet sticky.Then power came back on about 30 min past FO and then my internet failed shortly after LO and had to set up the internet sticky again. But in trading we dont make excuses so just saying not blaming it Personally I made plenty of mistakes but I do so love days like these as they are what its all really about.Anyone can win on days like yesterday but days like today are different.I guess I like being on the front line in the trenches some times even though those guys normally get slaughtered You seem to have chosen wisely. I will keep on going at it till my time is up and I have to start work or I get to my DD limit or back in the blue if that is even possible Let see. Will update later Rooi

--- 帖子 #216 ---
-20

--- 帖子 #217 ---
yeh, tricky today I'd have given up if I hadn't had a coffee, its rule number 1 ....lol I agree its the sh*t days that we need to overcome, the good days look after themselves with this approach. Over the weekend I'd been looking at my losing days and noticed the short price cycles combined with a series of little candles (less than 2 pips) seemed to characterise my bad days. Once the volume started the swings got larger and you could enter and close out a profit. Good luck for the rest of session Rooi

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I agree with some of it It cuts both ways the vol thing but will talk about it later. Will give a decent report about today aswell All the best PS : Coffee should be a given.Like in the old days when they delivered milk in the morning

--- 帖子 #219 ---
-17 and done as I have nearly start my normal job and wanted to write the report while it is fresh in my mind. After commissions I am up a just for the week thus far proving that I should have made more yesterday 1 Classic lower low break out entry in a down trending market.Not uncommon to miss the start of the trend as it can often start in the earlier Asia session.Will do a proper back test over the weekend regarding that break out entry as apposed to a more aggressive entry when the HA candles turn color again move on the other side of the MA.This situation has been rolling around in my mind for while and its important to remember that there is nothing wrong with losers.Losers are a part of the system and are needed to have winners so one should not break what is not broken but always look to improve it when possible or at least look into it. 2 Good sound setup and execution,might look at slightly bigger SL but nothing really wrong there 3 Same breakout setup and it failed and like said previously these can be a pain in the but but necesary YET if I didnt wait for the breakout my SL could have been 3 pips smaller because my entry would have been higher.Blue box shows correct area.Not easy area but will look at back testing it over the weekend Trade should never have been exited where it was exited.Late entry leaves me more exposed and feeling the pain more and then need to close it.If trade 3 was manged well it would have been a profit and no need for trade 4 4 Decent entry and movement and should have been a winner id exited properly.Same old same old,IF YOU NEVER TAKE PROFIT YOU WILL NEVER BE IN PROFIT.This is not swing trading.Take the money as per the system and when it is available.We want to catch the the moves that happen most of the time not hope and pray for the 100 pip moves the whole time 5 Nothing wrong 6 SL to big,remember tho measure the distance need for the long stop ans short stop.Nothing wrong with entry just stop in the wrong place.Losers are losers they are just part of the system. 7 Very aggressive entry and been plaguing me for while when there are very strong moves that break out like that and often we are unable to trade them because if we wait then its to late.Need to do some back testing of this over the weekend 8 classic reversal and running scared with a shit exit for TP2.Have to remember that I dont have a crystal ball and can be 100% every time.Mistakes were made earlier and so it then leads to more mistakes 9 Nothing wrong.Good exit and patience 10 Late entry , bigger SL.Same shit bla bla 11 messed up the numbering 12 Late entry , same shit ,bla bal 13 good entry and good trade . little lucky but I had my plan.If stopped out here my daily DD would have been reached 14 good entry 15 wanted to short in the blue box as it greatly reduces the SL and will back test in future 16 sound entry.looks late IMHO , not signal wise but move wise 17 end of play for the day and just exited Have to do some work now and will fix grammar spelling and typos later and write a summary of points made Oh well

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I often abandon the partial profit taking if my first trade is a full 1R loss, as it's often difficult to catch back up taking partial profits.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
not a bad result considering the market today, you fought hard. good analysis, there's often nothing wrong with the signal or where it happens on the chart, after all its a probability game, sometimes the indicators are in tune with the movements in the market and sometimes they're not. I'm sure we'll catch the 100 pip move tomorrow (probably)

--- 帖子 #222 ---
hit and run at the NYSE open, should have pulled the trigger on the second trade as the momentum was there......never mind.

In the spirit of friendly observation, no criticism intended. But noticed that last long you took was right into resistance/re-test, would have been better for a convincing break upwards. all the best, as always.

Very nicely done.Simple and easy The coffee served you well in the trade that you did pick Im done for the day as well. Man,I get very exited in the pre-open.Like a teenage boy,ends up ruining the bigger profit for the day. I take it as no DOW for you later.I might have a glance at it All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Not sure what you mean but there is no real "slope"indicator as such if you are referring top the angle of the slop in degree or a an actual number that I am aware off.If that is not what you were thinking of then please explain and we can see if there is something that you might fins useful Rooi

--- 帖子 #274 ---
nicely done Rooi on that last short trade , noticed you closed before MA cross or the support line, have you changed your plan of attack on that?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Try the Stoch Tape. There is an option to choose it to change color if there is a cross or the slope changes. Put both indicators in mql folder. Hope this helps you.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Not really changed it but was a nice spike and was on -2 so went onto Breakeven and then took both TPs at 19pips for 38 pips to finish early.If it was less aggressive I might have held.Could have closed one and let it run but just wanting to finish this morning I guess.According to the rules it should be an exit for the 2nd TP when it crosses the MA Did you have a go this morning ?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
ok, cool no, just trading the YM later all the best

thankyou i'll have a look

Good trading as usual Rooi, it seems you now take signals before FO? Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi IP Where I took the long will always be difficult place to trade but very important as you can see.It could have gone the other way and even slipped me on my SL and then I would have had a long Friday working to get back to BreakEven but I hate not taking the signal like that because they do have a lot of potential and can often go just one direction.There is other news that spike up ad down like craze and I will not even go near it.As long as one can accept the risk that you are taking then and have a clear exit plan then the trade is possible in my opinion Trade just before FO and LO can be very rewarding if you can stomach the whips that you might get some days

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hello rooi. I'm a fan of rj's thread. There's one thread about genesis matrix i made up using my mother's tongue language.Simple questions. What is fo.

Hi redwed Yes is a very nice system.We there are some guys posting here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...95#post8326195 FO = Frankfurt Open PA = Price action Yes there needs to a 1 pip improvement on the signal candle like here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...45#post7795545 Please ask if you might want any more answers All the best Rooi

Hi Rooi and thanks for your work&amp;share! This morning situation (GU between FO and LO+2): Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1 vertical line - signal bar 2 vertical line - confirmation by close at (at least) +1 pip 3 vertical line - entrance buy with TP=6+spread (higher gorisontal line) SL=nearest low swing (lower horisontal line) ---&gt; SL hit in several minutes 1. What did I did wrong? 2. Maybe we should add some trend filter? For example EMA200 and sell only below it? Thanks for all advices!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi Since 808080 I am happy to help as I received lots of great advice from experienced traders when I was still learning this method You did nothing wrong really,the only thing you did wrong was to not take the next short signal as you would have made back your pips Please see screenshot attached the grey squares are entries.The thumbs up is if the signal worked,the thumbs down is if it didn't work and the check-mark is to show that according to the rules it was a correct entry. Regarding a " trend filter " . I thought about it many times but decided that I must be the trend filter as the trend can be very very complex on the 1 min time frame.One could say there is definitely a trend on GU this morning so far and taking longs without a decent break of the highs might have been a bad idea. If you stick with this method then it becomes easier to spot the not so great setups as you get a better feel for it. Please let me know if there is anything else I might be able to help with Rooi ​

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thank you, Rooi! Could you please tell more about two points of the first message of the topic: Why have you removed 2 stochs from your system? Why right this time period? (between FO and LO+2) Sorry, it's because English is not my native language. Could you rephrase or add info? Thank you again!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I will answer some of your question. About the stoch: Above is already mentioned by Rooi in the first post.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi, Just looked at your idea and one question I have.On the origional posts your superb chart shows a yellow MA Please could you let me know what that MA is i.e. simple exponential or what and on close open etc and the number is it a 5 or a 10 or what.? I would be most grateful for that small piece of information Many thanks Happy trading

--- 帖子 #307 ---
And one more question from your example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Why is the blue vertical line confirmed buy-signal not according to the rules? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi. It was a buy signal but in a down trend and for me I would have waited for a bit more improvement

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi It the MA from genesis

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Spot on

--- 帖子 #311 ---
between FO and ( LO+2 hours after LO )

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Many thanks for your help.This is in fact your key player as I see it .Dependent on the candle readings and the higher time frame trend bias, basically go short below the EMA and long above. All the rest below in window 2 etc is not really of much value ,except like a friend to say yeah its ok go for it. I like to see simple things. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I like this system and train and train and train. But absolutely every day I have ~ 2 TP and 2 SL equal. 0 or small loss everyday. Some ideas how to filter signals?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi The only way to filter is to train , train , train ( practice , practice , practice ) Rooi

--- 帖子 #315 ---
If you put up a screenshot showing entry, target, stop loss, then one could answer or at least contribute to helping you.Please put up a screenshot because until then no one knows what you are actually doing.Hence you cannot get any ideas from others. Happy trading

Hey guys, I'm going through a bit of a midlife search and as such am looking for a new type of trading that will help me achieve my goals. I've been trading for over a decade but am now at a stage where I want to reduce screen time as I realize over the years I've become a bit of a chart junkie at the cost of watching my kids grow up. I don't object to doing the hard work but in order to know whether it meets my trading criteria and personality could those of you who've been using this for a reasonable length of time provide some stats to further help me assess my whether this system suits my needs before I dive in to the testing stage (which for me will be hundreds of hours): % Wins Average pip gain Average pip loss number of trades per day/week/total average trade length pairs traded Best session to trade etc. My preference is for a system with over 80% win rate with clearly defined, objective rules. 10-20 pips per trade, and up to 3-4 hours screen time per day. Thanks.

hello dear, may i try creating Multitime frame EA using Stochastic indicator but give me a rule every time frame M1 M5 M15 M30 H1 H4 D1 or any good system thxs

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Anyone still using this strategy? Looks interesting.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Genesis was always an excellent thread and system but it's a familiar story around here. They chase all the great people away such as RJ, Strat and it looks like Rooi went the same way. The vast majority of people who become consistently profitable no longer want to put up with the bullshit that the Forex Factory dishes out. If you're new to trading or just looking for systems there are a few excellent threads on here to read, James 16, RJ's Genesis and Davits Pivot Trading are 3 that immediately come to mind. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Thanks for the reply mate, and passing on some other good threads to read. Will give em a good read over now.
