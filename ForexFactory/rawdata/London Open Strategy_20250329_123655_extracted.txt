Hi traders, here is a very simple strategy that I’d like to share, test and develop if possible. I have a demo account set-up with 3000€ in it to forward test the idea, starting Monday, and I’d like to publish the results here in this thread at the end of the trading week for general discussion and possible improvements. All levels of trading competence are welcome to participate and let’s keep it friendly please. I’ll be trading EURUSD 5min chart only at the moment. My chart is set-up like this, a 15 period Exponential Moving Average and i-ParamonWorkTime, (just goggle it and you’ll find it) EMA is there to trade against, and the iPWT shows a 15min warning (grey area) finishing at the London Open time, the moment to take a trade or not : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is the time the trade is opened : Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is last Fridays trade, can’t believe how utterly perfect it is.... maybe fortune is smiling. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Joking aside, here are some charts that I hope will explain better than words the strategy I’ll be testing and the different kinds of Open we can expect. Thanks for reading. EDIT: here is the LONDON OPEN v1 template as of 29-07-2014 : Attached File(s) LONDON OPEN v1.tpl 21 KB | 2,306 downloads | Uploaded Jul 29, 2014 8:33pm Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Could you explain the main difference(s) to the other endless LO/NY-BO systems out here in FF.com and nether giving a continous success ?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
This isn't a Breakout system. If anything it's more like the 'coin flip' thread. I'm not trying to be different, I just want to test out an idea clearly, show results and come to a conclusion.

Quidsey: Excellent technique for consistent profitable trades. This also occurs at the European Market open, 1 hour before London, and I have several trading partners who take this trade everyday with a high success rate. For me, the time is too early so I generally look for the same types of patterns you detail here after red news clears during the US session. Nice post, thanks for your thoughts, this is a great way to trade.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Quidsey, Nice little section on the opening, have you experimented with any other pairs such as Cable for the London Session? I'm goign to try it myself starting tomorrow! keep posting with your results!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
That's good to hear pipster1 . Please feel free to share your experiences with this type of trading method.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Quidsey, thanks for putting up this thread. My first question: Why did you not move your SL to 10 pips on your thursday example, or putting it another way, under which scenario would your full 20 pips SL be hit? Thanks edit: the one with 13 pips drawdown

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi, yes I see what you mean. I put those charts up just as examples of different scenarios, in reality you're right I would have been stopped out -10. Sorry for the confusion. I hope never to be stopped for -20, if we've got the direction right price should move away quickly as London kicks off and we can reduce our risk straight away. Same if things don't go our way at the open. A 20 point move can happen of course but it's very rare and is often news based which we would be aware of in advance. There is a balance that we always need to keep an eye on between keeping losses small and getting stopped out of good trades.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
You're wrong, Quid is right.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks for the clarification, no trades with upcoming news of course...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You are both right. I am wrong. My apologies.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Bill, could you explain why you think that. For me the London open is 8am British summer time. The charts are Alpari uk which are normally set to GMT+2. However, during British Summer Time (BST) platform time is GMT+3. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Oh ok..... you had me going there billy boy

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Quidsey, I was wrong. My mistake- I apologize for any confusion I may have caused.

Probably won't have the time to do this everyday but here's how today panned out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #19 ---
it seems like you always move your sl to 10 pips after price goes against you why don't you put it at 10pips in the first place?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Probably guarding against spikes on the LO

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Yeah fair enough, that might turn out to be the thing to do, I can certainly make a note of it and look at the probability over time. I don't as yet have enough data on the MM side of things, this is something I want to work on. My reason for the initial 20 hard stop is to try and avoid any nasty pops in price around a very volatile time in the market. Sometimes it's not enough I know, but as I mentioned earlier the big pops tend to be news fed so we should have some warning..... due diligence. It's a trade off, excuse the pun, between what I can afford to risk and what I consider a pop free distance. I hope these sort of vague ideas can be optimised with more data. BTW... if anybody knows of a good MT4 Money management EA please let me know I've been looking but nothing has been found as yet.

Hi moneymove welcome, nice stats mate

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Nice find Quidsey. It might be kind of fun to find an average move in the wrong direction, (say 1-3 pips) and hold your entry until then. This ciold make your SL smaller and targets bigger.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi diamond, are you saying average the drawdown to then adjust the entry on the 8am candle by that amount?.

Hi Pat, I'll have another look at that thread, didn't get it first time round. I haven't placed a trade this morning which is boring, but there's just no real direction going on at the moment. If price had pushed lower making a break for it I'd have been happy to fade 3420 previous lows. Hope it breaks that D pivot and heads for R1 for you Pat, for what it's worth if I'd have placed a trade it would have been long too.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I think I will close the long for quick almost 10pip profit at 1.3440. I opened with 0.5 lot only not bad for a short period of work haha (If ever it reaches that area. Highest so far is 1.3438)

--- 帖子 #36 ---
......it's through the DP now, next stop yesterdays high maybe.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I closed already @ 1.3441 already.. gained round 4%... good system! will want to test this daily for quick 5 to 10pips

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Nice one. In retrospect I should have taken this, not just because it went where it should have but I had my normal conservative "real money" trading head on, I need to try and take every trade. Been a long time since I traded demo. This was a legitimate trade to take within the strategy as it stands. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
It would be nice to know a bit more about how, whoever wrote this came to his/her conclusions, what market? over how long a period? and what in the analysis is considered a reversal?. I'm not being cynical, the cycles seem to match up pretty much with my own (untested) ideas of intraday movement, hence this thread, but I often find that a lot more wisdom can be gained if the data is presented with the conclusion. What are the probabilities associated with a 3amNY reversal? I hope there high Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
The previous day based on your screenshot, a short on the first candle at London Open would have bagged a sure 5pip win. And with the right risk% on the trade, it would have been substantial profit for the day. Then trade again the following day. Fast in, Fast out, Green Pips daily.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Really nice to use with support resistance

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Quidsey: i feel like these time zones are dependent on red pending news. Because pending news generally falls in these time zones, price action tends to become more volatile during these times. Personally I trade around the news. Once red pending news clears, I wait for an entry trigger. If other factors such as waves of movement, supt/res, daily candles, risk reward, dollar strength etc.. are also favorable, then i place a pending order. This tends to give a trade a higher probability of success. Do you consider news a factor when using your London open strategy?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi, I don't think it's a major factor. If you look back through the calendar there really isn't very much red news for EUR at that time. There are plenty of days with none at all, then occasional flash Pmi's, libor, or the SNB can issue a statement and there's always the ECB for stirring things up. Be aware of news, especially red stuff of course, it's part of the ritual, but I'm not going to avoid it. Totally respect your rationale, but this strategy is about hitting the nail on the head at the open and riding the wave as far as we can.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Nice to see another London Open thread.. There are many variations to play with it. I did start off with London breakout (LBO for short) on GBP crosses. Wasn't that consistent and finally found my mojo with the FTSE CFD. The London session trading is a great way actually as it personally helped me to fine tune my strategy. I bet those who strictly follow the system and make note of what caused losing trades incl. news releases and days of the week, will find a comparable edge atleast in terms of minimizing the losses. Good luck.. Sorry my post is a bit off topic, but thought i'd chip in with my 2 cent.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi jw, not at all off topic, thx for the input. Your right about the variations on a theme, I'd be happy to hear about, or see any of your mojo at work I'm looking around similar threads to try and pick up some ideas.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Nice observation. Its amazing how different parameters, indicators can point to the same and yield same result. You may wish to check it out on US open too. It reminds me of the excitement at the begining of every academic session. Simple psychology.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hey Quidsey! I guess it has worked today right? Waiting for your replay!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I went short 1.3408

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Morning guys, yeah short, stop now BE 3406. Targets below S1, WS1, and S2. Still in danger zone for a move back to DP but we've broken yesterdays low. Lets try and hang on...... big ADP at NYO.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Forgot to mention, I was looking into this yesterday. I only looked at the last 40 LO days (I know that's not a lot) but I was finding around 65% of winning trades going to 10pips with a 10pip +spread stop loss. Certainly worth more investigation.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Closed at 1.3398 for 10pips.. i'm happy with that if it becomes a daily thing

--- 帖子 #52 ---
wow thanks for looking... In that case, best to open 2 positions same time. One = TP 5 pips, Second = move to BE at 5pips, TP at 10pips.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hello Guys, Why short? Can anyone explain please. The EMA is going down before London open, so we should go long, isn't it? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thought the same, but it looks like Quidsey is looking at the last 30 min. or so?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Ghadeer, this strategy is in it's infancy, at the moment I'm just proposing a premise so that we might possibly make some regular money, so really we're all learning. Simple way to show you the way I look at it is with a chart, this is just my opinion. You may see things differently, that's fine, let's make money. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Every trader that trades this is going to see that 15EMA slightly differently, but it's not about the EMA it's about every trader who trades it being consistent in their decisions. Sorry, that sounds like one of those "feel the force" type thread wise statements but it's true, trading is very personal (if you're not using an EA).

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Last 4 trading days look positive, 4 wins if we were looking for +10pips, 12pip SL. 3 of those trades gave a lot lot more. The Mon trade only gave up it's 10pips the following day. Drawdown minimal. Attached Image (click to enlarge) $3000 acct Risk 5% (you've got to go for it on small accounts) Lot size 1.25 +10 pips = $125 *4 days = $500 = 16.5% increase ......maybe we got lucky

--- 帖子 #57 ---
did you trade that?! Wow! I only did 0.5 lots for past 2 days at 10pips profit... I think more conservative at 1.0 lot but TP only 5 pips.. we will see.. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi there, I will be following along with a fresh account; nice addition to the 00-level strat from Udine...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Strong selling coming into the open, going to buy into it.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Quidsey, mind me asking where is your TP?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
3400, but we're struggling a bit at the moment. Had some + news this morning but EUR CPI coming out later...... DP could be a problem. ARRGH! nightmare PC problems this morning.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
In spite of the Asian session ranging in a box of 8 pips?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi Quidsey That was a nice trade this morning. Martin

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Yes, just to clarify my ideas about the overnight range. If the open is in the range and price has been flat on the approach, EMA flat, then I think this should be a 'no trade'. There isn't the direction/momentum so difficult to apply the strategy. Looking at todays chart for example, yes there was a tight range overnight, and had price opened around 3396 after a flat approach then that's a 'no trade'. But it broke out early and got some red on the board, that means sellers (breakout) coming in, long stops under the range stopping out, and buyers (faders) coming in. That's what I wanted to buy into with a long trade at the bell. Some call it catching falling knives. That's the bet, that it's profitable to fade momentum at the LO. I'm about to start back testing 2013 trade by trade to see what that turns up. There are other factors to iron out and optimize on the MM side of things of course, but I believe that is an ongoing concern anyway as the market changes. We're in a low volatility forex world at the moment but that may change.

Cheers Martin, we're on a good run at the moment, there will be bad days

hi Quidsey subscribed and good luck with thismethod. just a thought , might be a good idea to put a pending order above or below the last candle before lo or abve below 1st candle lo save some drawdown and some SL.? Regards Orid peter

Thought I'd post a video link to an old BBC documentary, mid eighties, Billion Dollar Day. You probably know it, but apart from being hilarious in places I thought it might give us a little insight and food for thought. It follows the global trading day and of course the interesting bit for us here is the Asian London cross-over. It's only 30min long, hope you enjoy: Inserted Video

Where are we heading, down to 3292 or up to 3475? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Too range bound today? unless something more dramatic happens in the next 7 min!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Yes that's a pretty messy approach, I was looking for another push down into 3377-79 area before getting long. It's just broke the overnight low but market's lacking players.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
i entered long @ 1.3383 and closed at 1.3390. quick pips!

So did I, +5 pips, chickend out just before the daily open...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is exactly what I wanted off the open. Anyway all that aside the strategy has produced another winner. Took a bit of heat, but didn't get stopped and price went on to target +10. Back later.

I think i slowly understand your system...will start trying on next week!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Quidsey, Thanks for sharing your trading method. Last night was my 1st trade; I was totally exhausted at the London Open, but I managed to place a Sell trade with a TP=15 and a SL=15. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! I am intrigued as to where your method will take us... Great trading, BC2

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Dash, welcome, keep us informed. Ask away if you've a query.

Nice one Dash, just remember this strategy is being tested, don't go betting the farm

Here's the weeks trading with entries, SL and TP's. Have a good weekend all, see you Monday. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Quidsey, Just want to double check with you that SL is 20 pips? How about TP?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Quidsey, I really like this idea of a strategy and when I get some time I can code this into an EA and use on a spare demo account, but I need to be very clear with you about how the strategy works as I've tried testing it and had some mixed results. 1.) Two lines drawn, one line 15min before London Opening and one line on the oneing minute of London session 2.) If the 15 EMA is roughly trending down between line 1 and line 2 this will generate a Long signal with a 15 pip stop loss and 15 pip Trade Point 3.) if the 15 EMA is roughly trending up between line 1 and line 2 this will generate a Short signal with the same TP and SL as stated above? My question is apart from observing the prior trading session, e.g. the asian session if its been a bit flat avoid trading, but do you place your trade on the opening candle on the opening of London Session or do you wait for the candle to be green if going long or red if going short?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi Ned yes I'm sure you're finding mixed results, at the moment we haven't got an edge. Welcome along though. I wanted to make it clear at the start that this is an idea to test and improve and hopefully create some profitable method out of a premis. At the moment we haven't really got a working strategy and we're far from making an EA, but great that we've got a programmer along The problem we have is that long term I think we're as good as a coin toss at the moment, (maybe worse). We need to create some filters to try and weed out the bad trades and increase profit in good trades which can improve our bottom line considerably. The strategy is all about the open (obviously) but I may have been too focused on that 'moment' to see trading possibilities around it. Thanks to "orid" who offered the idea of putting pending orders on previous candle hi/lo's or even the LO candle itself, and playing the break of that up or down. Made me think. I trade a longer term Daily set-up with similar ideas. I've been looking through the manual backtesting I've been doing over the weekend and I'd like to just offer up some ideas that passed through the brain on how to maybe improve our results. Bigger TP, trades with the trend allow for potentially greater targets but often not easy to obtain without threatening our position before moving away. Look at pre-open PA for clues to better judge and make the right choice, Reverse or Continuation or NoTrade. I've been noting a specific pattern before Continuation Look to other pairs that offer better set-ups, greater momentum. The Aussie often sees volatility coming into the open 45mins to an hour before for example. Look to find trending pairs (keep the spread small) Trade a retest of the open. S/R, swings and Previous days Hi/Lo. In reply to your question Ned, yes that is what we started with. Now not all of them reverse of course, so we need a clue to help decide if it will or not. Something that will tilt the odds in our favour.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Dash, at the moment I'm testing 10+Spread which is holding out pretty good. Trades are 1R, so TP10 but I'm seeing a lot of with trend trades going for more. We saw it on last weeks trading, potentially some of the short EURO trades could have had some amazing RR. The longs were limited.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks for replying...understand now.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I did a quick backtest over the weekend last two months on eu usd with placing pending order above or below last candle prior to LO with fantastic results With SL 10 pip and TP 10 pip 20 wins 5 loss 160 pips the angle of the Ma is a bit vague. I tended to go opposite direction to the general trend before LO rather than the last 15 mins . infact the last 3 candles seem to give a good indication of the direction to trade in a lot of cases . did try couple other pairs with terrible results the beauty of the pending is if it goes wrong way from the start no dd also it does come back a few times to take order and profit Regards orid sorry everyone those results were over 2 months not weeks , feel a right pillock orid

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Good start to the week. Straight out of the gate, a classic buy signal was given as London opened. A 12 pip stop was never challenged and partial profits, 50%, were taken at plus 12 pips. Now the stop loss has been moved to BE + 2 and a trailing stop will let it run if it wants to with one more partial profit set at plus 40 pips. Off to bed now and I'll check the results in the morning. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
good idea! i closed with 10 pips TP next time i think to close 50% and let the other 50% go. Thanks mate, sleep well! greetz Michael

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I am currently placing only 1 trade on EURUSD until I get a better feel for the price action. Having said that, I am trading live on Oanda with a very small amount. +15 pips on Friday and +10 pips this morning. Price was below the EMA15 at the LO, and so I place a pending order 1 pip above the EMA15 to verify a change in direction. SL=12; TP=10. If price does not break the EMA15, there is no trade. So far...so good. Great trading!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Morning guys, winners all round on a Monday can't be bad Smooth, yes partial profits is something I want to look into, especially letting 1lot ride. Good trading to you sir.

Hi orid, that's interesting. Let me make sure I got this right. So you're placing only 1 pending order still based on fading the trend, what candle are you using 5min? could you post a chart of the set-up? ....and you're looking for a BO of that candle in one direction, you're not straddling. The last 2 weeks have been kind, try January this year, not so kind I always try and look for worst case scenarios.

sorry quidsey those results were over last two months not weeks yes last 5 min candle or at least 4 pips above /below close

Tried today to trade the EURUSD, had good result but was away to close at the Donchanian Peak so I've left the trade open. Couldn't set my stop loss/trade point because of an EA in the background moving and placing my SL/TP so that's why I left it. Good result this morning from indications. Also attached a 9 period RSI with levels set between 40/60 for indication as to when is good to buy and sell when looking for setting of trade point perhaps.

Entered a bit late today 1.3422 exited 5 pips profit with 1 lot... good enough for me for the day

--- 帖子 #106 ---
What do you guys think, potential for a 6 pip profit based on the opening of the first green candle New York Opening???

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Test it Ned, I've got my hands full with London I'm having a look to see if correlation of the USDCHF can help. The two pairs are highly negatively correlated in the -90's, so if for example the EURO set-up to buy is unclear or we've got doubts and there is a clear set-up on the USDCHF to short then this could potentially confirm our buy trade on the EURO, and obviously vice versa. This pair might be worth looking at anyway as a comparison in the morning, smaller ADR though.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Great idea Quidsey, why i never think of that....

--- 帖子 #109 ---
The ADR is important and can help to refine both the SL and TP levels. I use the ADR to determine my areas where I will take partial profits. I tend to take a small partial profit at about 10% of the ADR (just to cover all commissions, spread, and swaps), and then again at about 25% of the ADR. From that point on, I let the market dictate where I will get out of my final position, via Trailing Stops. I also protect my position by moving my original stop to BE + 2 pips between when the market has moved to 20 to 25% of the ADR. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Yes I like ADR, I'm going to add that to the template I think. So with EU now at say 40 ADR you'd move to BE +2 after it had gone 10pips, that seems tight to me but I guess that's scalping. How many of these BE's go on to bigger things? I'm not a BE fan normally but I'm thinking more and more partial profits is the way to go. 3 lots, 2 in one order TP 10pips and the 3rd in another order to see how far we can run it. Btw, is it the same percentages you use for the SL?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
As my profile states, I am a reformed pit trader. I was always taught that you learn how to take a loss, manage a loss, minimize a loss because the profits will take care of themselves. I also learned early on never to worry about taking a small partial profit or moving a stop loss to BE too soon. If they get hit they have fulfilled the number 1 rule: PRESERVE THY CAPITAL!!!! It's always better to be patient and have capital to trade another day, than to watch your account dwindle or get destroyed. With this in mind, I have never had a losing month in 37 years of trading. (That includes all of my accounts as a whole. I have had small down months in stocks, but my options and FX accounts more than made up for them.) I do tend to set my major TP and SL levels the same. This gives me a RR of 1:1, but sometimes my BE SL is hit after my small TP and this reduces the RR level, but I have some current trades that are going on two years old and have grown into long term positions with trailing SL levels of 700 pips and floating profits of 2500 + pips. They may only be 5 or 10% of the original position size from when they were put on, but they contribute substantially to my equity.

awesome guys...... I'm the only dick that didn't take it

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Well, I got in a bit late and of course out a bit early, so only 8.9 pips. Looks like it was more of a news trade (red for the GBP coming up), so just lucky I guess...

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I also got +11 on demo...not bad for 2 days on a row!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Quidsey, The 15 minute window was to much of a mess to trade for me, also.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
my reason for going short was that the trend was generally rising for the last 6 hour or so on the 5m before LO although quite shallow. 2 cents worth. Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #127 ---
..... there's a bit of luck in a lot of things wow! freakin home run today, price now coming into it's ADR zone and S3. I got totally shafted by my own brain today, jeezzz I gotta get more monotone. So the question remains about how do we profit from days like this when price is running away and we're on that same wave? (well some of us) What's out there that works? I was going to break my trade up today as I said, 2 trades and let one roll..... perfect example today of what that could add to our accounts. The roller trade has collected 4X the normal TP of 10, that's +3 wins. Yesterday it didn't work, you'd have BE on that 2nd trade and you'd have lost a 1lot going to 1st target. Which is statistically better? I like the 'Partial' approach but these breakout days need to be frequent. Something to test. I also need to be in the ruddy trade.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Nice overnight trend break re-test, selling into bullish momentum, even had what I trade on higher TF's an up &amp; under right shoulder. That's 7 straight winners for the strategy so far.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Nice thread Quidsey. Based on previous comments I've backtested this strategy, incorporating a straddling (OCO) entry method. My parameters are: 1. Enter long 3 pips above close of 07:55-08:00 [UK time] bar OR 2. Enter short 3 pips below close of 07:55-08:00 bar 3. Cancel order if no trigger by 08:15 4. Don't trade red 8am news releases (eg flash manufacturing) or on bank holidays So this means there'll almost always be a trade. The advantage being that it still captures big moves where price has continued along Frankfurt trend and refused to fake-out (it can happen). Based on 7 weeks of back-testing the results are encouraging: drawdown consistently ranging from about 2 to 4 pips, and about 75% success for targets of 5-9 pips (not including spread). I've started forward-testing as of this morning. Points on the board already.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
haha nevermind quidsey I lost yesterday because my pending rule tbh im happy targeting just 10 pips a day , make lots mulla on that

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I didn't get a chance to try this morning but the whole system is looking really good. Was thinking... If a Stop Loss was placed say 10 pips from entry price and is hit, if the current past price movement shows that there's atleast a good 10-18 pip movement at that time of movement then I reckon a Pending Trade should also be placed at the Stop Loss to capture the reverse move to gain atleast 8-10pips. Also I've just been experimenting with SQLite in MT4 which I've managed to get working so thinking of writing an indicator which takes the 15 EMA values between 07:45-08:01 London Opening, the Bid+Ask Price for all available currency pairs supplied by broker (Mines Alpari) which could be good to run one week to look at consistent pairsv during the open, e.g. work out if EMA is avergaing up/donw trend and then look at max/min price say upto 30 minutes after to confirm strategy? My intention after that is to then look at the stats to determine whether an EA would generate potential good hit rates?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Ahoy! welcome along. Nice find, keep us informed of your results. Try it on Jan Feb if you can, those were not easy months as far as I can see. I'll be honest OCO's are not personally the way I want to trade, I've been there and not had much fun, but if you can make it work that's cool. A real mover today, hope this is the way forward.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Wow pending order at the SL! like I said Ned, personally something like that would have to be automated for me, I'd get confused. I'd really like to keep things simple so that the strategy stays focused and straightforward for people to trade. I want this to be a robust method of making money for everybody, myself included. Don't want to get on my high horse about it Your findings on the EMA should be interesting. :nerd:

--- 帖子 #134 ---
It appears as if he is using a loss management system to reduce or eliminate his losses. There are some out there that are very good and have been set-up as an EA. You can check one of them out here: http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/php...forum.php?f=81 . I personally have utilized systems very similar to these for years and have begun using one "wealthmaster's ALR" just because it is automated and you can let it run without being stuck to the screen. You are also absolutely correct in identifying this as completely separate from your system. Your system identifies trade setups for profits with an acceptable level of risk and should be used, and tested, as such. The loss management system has to be viewed, and tested, on its own merits because it has a completely different function, reducing the impact of a losing trade upon equity. This goes back to my training. I will always try to prevent loses by utilizing trading methods that give me a good chance of consistently showing a profit, and if there is a losing trade, either take the first smallest possible loss or have management in place to reduce it under acceptable conditions. In the time that I managed floor operation for a brokerage firm this was so important with the "error" account. There had been those that turned small acceptable losses into large losses that could harm the firm because of poor management, or even destroy a bank ie Barings Bank. Rule # 1 "PRESERVE THY CAPITAL" GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks ST, appreciate your input. Any professional I've come into contact with over the years has always talked more about loss than profit. Totally get where you're coming from in regards to capital. One of the things I like about the opening trade is that it often resolves itself quite quickly, that's to say, if price doesn't start moving the way we want fairly swiftly we're either in chop or we're in the wrong way. Not always the case but often. Either way there is time to look to reduce risk. As it stands at the moment we could move from -10 to -5pip or up near the candle that's gone against us. There is also the possibility to reverse position of course. The risk is you might get it wrong twice. I'm certainly capable of over thinking a trade. Btw what winning method/s are you using ST?, just curious The backtesting I'm doing on the rolling trade seems very positive, there are definitely gains to be had, just need to find the best way of managing it.

Today is a bit more of a counter trend trade, so I think it will be a little bit slower developing and the profit potential is not as great. Of course it doesn't take much if you can bank GREEN pips every day. As soon as these trades hit my partial profit zones, I'll move my SL to BE and head to bed. Then it's up to the trailing stops to manage my trade for me. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
closed half @ 1,33681 SL = BE+1 hope he can go up trough 1.337 Greetz Michael

--- 帖子 #146 ---
That's great. Now let the market give you what it can. I personally use FX Synergy to manage my trades because I can setup dynamic trailing stops that expand or contract as the price continues to move in my favor, ie I usually set up tighter trailing stops until the market moves in my favor then I expand them wider to let the market breath. That is how I still have trades on from last year. I can also setup multiple partial profit prices as the price moves in my favor. It allows you to setup partial profit points from 1% to 100% of your position. This way I only have to put on one trade and manage it from there. Continued success. GREEN pips to all.

Good morning everyone. It's about 30 minutes until the show begins. Be prepared for any type of trade. Yesterday was a classic counter-trend trade, which is the riskiest of the two, but it worked well and met the profit parameters of the system. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
so which way ? everyone what you reckon?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Note that the Asian session was relatively flat, although there could be a chance for a long as it started dipping well before the 15 minute window.

Purely a guess, but I think we will be entering shorts on the EU today. GREEN pips to all.

I Think it is long, now this is consfusing..

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I've gong Long, purely that the 15 EMA at 07:45 was probably at a pip to a pip and half higher than it was at 08:00 so the line of direction to me was down hence why I've gone for a long?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
i was thinking that too. Why short? EMA before london session was going down on m5. on the first post Quidsey wrote if ema i going down it will be long trade and if it going up it will be short. Can You explain this? Thanks for all for replie

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I decided to stand aside, it is unclear to me

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Your eye for detail is impressive. You should write it down in your journal every trade so that you can look back at it after the trade has been closed and either validate your observation or invalidate it. That way over time you will become more confident in your trades or identify situations where the system breaks down. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
now there's wisdom.....

--- 帖子 #183 ---
trade in progress lets see where it goes.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Im long too but I think I should have stayed out...ema difference between :45 and :00 too minimal. Probably should be considered a "no trade" day today.

Could anybody please clarify why did you go short? Because I've seen it like this: Attached Image

--- 帖子 #187 ---
USDCHF bouncing off DP, SL to 3381

--- 帖子 #188 ---
The reason that I went short was because the open of the 5 minute bar, 15 minutes before the London open, was lower than the open of the 5 minute bar @ the London open and the 15 EMA was flat to slightly up. GREEN pips to one and all.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I went short because there were3 candles before LO got rejected from 15ema, so I thought the wall (15ema) too hard to get thru

--- 帖子 #190 ---
-10 for me today. When i look at ema today in last 15 mins it is little up so short should be right direction. anyways learned lot today. regards jeet

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Went short at 77; got out at 68; netted 7. Thanks Quidsey. I got out because of daily pivot. Back to bed. Good pips to all.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
We can learn a great deal from our losses if we take the time to write down our observations, reasons for initiating the trade, and how we managed it when it went against us. Mind you it still hurts, but I prefer to think of the draw down in capital seeds for even greater success in the future. I have been trading for over 37 years now, and I still learn something new every trade. GREEN pips to you always.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I've now put my position on auto pilot. I've taken my partial profit, set my SL at BE + 1 pip, and set it up for a trailing stop if the market continues to move. Time to say Good Night to everyone and sincerely wish you all a great deal of success in life, not just in trading. GREEN pips to you always.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hey Quidsey: Here is a screen shot of the charts a group I trade with use who trade European Market open (EOVM trade). Very similar to what you are doing they use tick charts. Usually good for a trade a day and win rate is around 70% I normally don't trade it because it is too early for me. I took a EU short today, went break even. A very similar trade occurs after US red news clears and is usually for a fair amount of pips. It is generally what I trade. Cheers and thanks for the thread

--- 帖子 #200 ---
gained 5pips on the Long trade today at the open.. too bad closed 50% at TP, then other 50% hit BE.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I noticed it took around 10 minutes to move 3 pips either way after the London open so I stayed on the sidelines (i.e. bottled it ). Looks like there were pips to be scalped, but it seems that price action inertia during the opening minutes after 8am UK time may be inauspicious for big moves. Is that a fair assessment?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Well today was one of those days..... they are often, which is why making money isn't as easy as just whacking a 15EMA on a chart and trading in the opposite direction. I don't think today was an easy call, as someone mentioned, and we all know that on another day it could have gone the other way because 'somebody said something' into a microphone. No grail here, we must remain humble in this market. Here are my thoughts numbered on the chart why I entered short today. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1- The overnight session although it managed to break yhigh has failed to hold onto it. The last test in the red zone is where buyers have given up. 2- Frankfurt has come in hard short and broken TL's and previous lows. All stops under that range taken out. USDCHF finding support off of the Daily open causing a strong breakout of a range. 3- This is where the pressure is on. The EMA is down here but the momentum coming into the Open is bullish and leaving tails, we want to fade this momentum. Opens are not always reversals, sometimes we need to see if it's in the middle of a pullback in a larger wave. USDCHF is at a perfect price for a bounce. 4- This is our backline for a short, above this and we're in the shit. Trendline retest, previous swing retest, Daily open. USDCHF sitting on support, we need $ strength to come in now or we're toast. 5- All resistance holds and we pass the LO, first obstacle Frankfurt low holds for 30mins, then down for a bounce off Daily pivot which is where our TP is waiting. USDCHF confirming our target with a nice support/resistance retest. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another +10 in the piptin but that one had me nervous. In what has turned out to be a range day I think that's not to bad a result. 9 winners in a row

could have been worse mate.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
That may well be true but ideas like this need to be put down in the journal and toted up from time to time to give a definitive answer. Personally I've not noticed it but then again I've not been looking. Edit: Reading this again I should make clear that obviously slow movement on the open is a cause for concern, we need a momentum wave to ride, but there can often be a 'lull' before it kicks off. If the 'inertia' continues into the 3rd and 4th candle then that's when I'd be anxious. Sidelines is a position mate if you're not sure, that's fine.

Todays trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Quidsey, I wondered why sometimes I have a different visual perspective regarding the EMA15 when looking at your posted charts and mine. Then I looked more closely and observed that your i-ParamonWorkTime indicator band actually includes the London 8:00 to 8:05 bar (4 bars instead of 3). So, in looking back over previous trades for the EMA15 direction and viewing the right side of your bands, there is 1/3rd more room for the EMA15 to change direction and alter the trade decision. For example, if you take this morning's trade, your 4 bar band resembles a "U" which may influence a sell decision. My 3 bar band was virtually flat which precluded a trade for me. I also realize that @ London 8:00 the additional bar would probably not affect an immediate decision to trade, but in retrospect, looking back at previous trades can be confusing because we are likely looking at the entire zone to determine winning setups and profitability. Thanks for all your help! BC2

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hey everybody, my coder made a simple EA based on this strategy. Test it and find may be better inputs. For me inputs: start trade at 10:15 (instead of 10) and SL 35 pips with TP 55 pips worked much better. Please no questions on how to test and so on, all is clear, I have no time on it. Once you get good testing results just let me and the thread know. Have a good day

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yes looking back at MA's is tricky because that last 5min will be flipping up and down like a cats tail in real time. Glad you got it sorted. The EMA is really just a guide, I'm not getting out the protractor to measure angles. :nerd: The build up to the open is as important to trying to understand what's going on and whose in control. We don't have volume or a book in FX so we have to try and detect and deduce from other clues. The EMA is but one of those. You're looking to make a decision on a continuation with the EMA or a reverse against. In a weeks trading we normally get both so we have to be a bit clever

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thanks, I'll have a look at that.

Hello Quidsey and all, Thanks for the interesting thread. I know news will affect PA considerably, so as an additional helper I am introducing an interesting indicator for you; attached is a zip file that contains an indicator and other necessary files for the indicator to work. You can have ForexFactory and/or DailyFX news releases as a choice, and as you can see from the screenshots news classifications (red/orange/...) do differ. So I have these two screens showing all news (set report all to true) to gauge the probable impact on PA. The beauty of this indicator is you can also have only relevant news showing on the chart of the pair by setting report all =false. There are other parameters to customize the view, so play with them at your leisure. For your convenience I have also attached two templates for each news source. Here all news are shown. Green pips to all, T.

Excellent technical analysis, and it points to the fact that you can't just follow the rules blindly. It's best to have some understanding of why they work too. This will allow you to stand aside when it doesn't feel or look right, so that you can preserve capital, or to have the confidence to increase your position size because all the ducks are in a row. One more London opening this week to look forward to. Let's all do our due diligence and be prepared for whatever trading, or non-trading, opportunity that the market offers us. Until then. . . . . GREEN pips to you always.

Hey guys, I'm all for people offering up a useful tool/indicator to help us in our decision making but I'd really like to keep the focus on the actual strategy we are testing. Totally understand that every trader will want, to some extent, to personalise the method. That's cool and natural.......but I'd like to keep this thread to the core strategy and the trading of it. I want the information to be clear and easy to follow. It's not easy trying to share thoughts about discretion, right or wrong I want to keep the chart clean and simple so that we can focus on the price and the momentum. I shouldn't have sold the idea that we're trading a 15EMA, I'm regretting putting it on the chart because it seems to take peoples attention away from the trade and towards the indicator and it should be the other way round.

... and you too jeet, it takes time to gain confidence in a strategy, every trade we take we can learn from. So here's the week. Our $3000€ has grown +7.6% over the last two weeks and now stands at $3228.86€. Nice to see but doesn't mean we can trade yet. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Wise words of wisdom. It is always better to understand the "why" behind any system or indicator as opposed to following it blindly. Congratulations to all those who made pips this week. Just as we need to learn from our losses, it is also advised to study our successes too. I would suggest following Quidsey's lead and printing up the chart afterwords so that notes and observations can be made and recorded for further study and understanding. I hope that everyone has a great weekend, and I look forward to next week's trading opportunities. GREEN pips to all.

Good morning friends.. ready for this week green pips to all.

Ive gone long today goodluck folks

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I've got long too. Wasn't sure as prior members on this thread may have taken a Short as the two candles formed at 07:45 were Bulls, but in my opinion the EMA was trending down and therefore a Long signal. Think if theres any luck this morning 7-9 pips might be had? Good luck everyone!

Hi guys, had a journey to make today so couldn't trade. Just got back so I'll collect my thoughts first before I put them in writing. All I'll say straight off the bat is that it looks like a horrible little Monday thrash about. Dash has it spot on again, and today he's laughing. Seriously I can't honestly say what I would have done, too much hindsight, but I can't see a winner there either way. Well done Pat. At the coalface tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Welcome back Quidsey. Hope you had a safe journey. I'll honestly stick to the 5 pip TP close 50% of position then let trade trail at 10pips or BE 1-2 pips. At least that 50% 5pip TP is worth something compounded daily.

hey dude like the thread -mad props

Morning, if we're looking for a long we want a good price, for me it'll be down at WS1 3350 area. If short looking @3368 with some PA. $chf broken R3.

gone Long today, looking for an 8 pip profit with 8 pip SL. Will take 5 if it doesn't make it?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Short @3368 SL @3378 TP @3350

--- 帖子 #258 ---
My 1 lot long at 1.3363 close at 1.3369, 6pips win good enough for me today.

Good trade management. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi folks, EU long at 3363, went out with +5 ("obvious" rollover) and simultaneously went long UCH which just closed at TP +5.3

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Closed out 3358 +10. Back later with charts....... need coffee......

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Way to go. I still have my short EU @ 1.3764 and my long UF @ .9082 Will take partial profits @ + 8 pips each and set SL @ BE + 1 pip then. Came close to my partial profit in the EU on the spike down. At + 12 pips I'll start trailing my SL @ 10 pips and expand the trail as the market moves with me. Today was a classic example of one of those days that if you manage your trades right, you definitely have a chance to make a profit whether you went long or short. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Partial profits are taken, and trailing stops are set. It's 4am here and it's time for me to catch a couple hours of sleep before my day begins. GREEN pips to all.

Hi ST, well at least you don't get any distractions at that hour...... the odd owl hooting maybe Great trading mate, I'm noting down all these runners. ZEW just gets worse! Today is another good example of it working. Backtrading this manually has certainly made me rethink the idea of getting in on the bell. Someone was talking about this early on in the conversation and they were right of course. I'm trying to write a summary of this strat so far with a hit list of discretionary criteria so that we can make better trades. Sleep well.

Here's todays charts with some notes. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1- Price not bullish at the open. 2- The low of yesterday broken. 3- S1 breaking and forming the Asian swing low. 4- European open breaks lower out of the range. 5- S2 doing it's job and supporting. 6- This momentum needs to keep on into LO. Coming into the last 15m before the open and the overall trend is bearish, but we're down at S2 and maybe price could bounce. Price losing momentum south. 7- Short or Long? Long: Possible trade off of S2 against the EMA and fade the range break against the previous trend. Short: Could go short at the bell and suffer the squeeze but that puts the SL under S1 level and vulnerable. Or I risk missing the boat but get better entry and stop placement. Decided to play the pullback retest short. A runner trade today could have netted +25-30pips which is considerable. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good morning everyone. Let's do our homework. Devise a plan, and fill our "Pip Jars" with some GREEN pips. Good trading to one and all. May the GREEN pips flow to you with the greatest of ease.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
WOW. The 15 minute window for both EU and UF were both virtually flat. No indication. No trade for me. Good luck and GREEN pips to all.

Same here. Have a good night SmoothTrader.

Morning, got suckered into this fake breakout this morning, went long @3368, SL @3358, TP @3378. Managed to get out @3362 which halved the loss, -5.5pips. Wanted to reverse but it never came back. Hope you guys did better.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Same here, waited for it @ 1.33585 expecting it to reverse and closed my order to lose a few pips. But was cheeky and place and order below mine for short to net 5 pips making up for my loss, could off left it but decided to cut my loss and leave it for today!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I went long also I should have stayed out as the EMA was showing flat last 3 candles before the open was only "slightly" downward

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Even though it was a losing trade, your quick decision to take a smaller loss than your original SL preserved some more of your capital. One of the hardest things to do is to NOT trade, but some times it is the right thing to do. Even though there was a great move in the EU, it did not conform to my rules of entry, and because of that I have no regrets that I didn't "catch" the move. I am in business to make money, and to make money on a consistent basis. I am not looking for the one big score to make me rich. I working towards becoming richer on a daily basis by making significantly more than I spend. May your "Pip Jar" continue to fill with GREEN pips. See everyone tomorrow. Good night.

Good morning, ...long as well: -10 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Nothing leading up to the open was telling me not to trade though ST. There was some good momentum from Franky, break above Daily open, above DP, with trend, a pullback to S/R and I'm in long. That is the strategy. There are losses with every method, that's trading. Had the Franky momentum been a little later I would have faded the breakout/EMA and we'd have a winner, again that's the strategy,(see Fridays LO 08-08) but today I was the sucker. I did have a moment of doubt when I was checking the Swissy just before the open and saw a bullish OB.... The first 5m candle told me that I was going the wrong way and I saw the stitch up, time to bail.

Good Morning all : ) Just found this thread today I like the idea of focusing on the London open and have been trading EurUsd as well looking to go short but looks as though I have missed a good point of entry at this point so will do a bit more analysis before I act..... Just wanted to say Hi and wish you all green pips

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Good morning Went short at 3360, moved SL down... -8.7 pips. Seems like the entry criteria need to be refined.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Short 1.3360 got out @ 5pips TP

--- 帖子 #290 ---
The info coming out of EU suggests to me that it will drop further but at the moment it is climing so going to wait for an entry point

--- 帖子 #291 ---
As I keep saying Go5 we're not just blindly fading the EMA. There is no guarantee that price will perform how we want it to, and then there's trade management, Pat took the same entry as you and is up +5pips. Why did you move your SL?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Entered 1.33658 short set TP -15

--- 帖子 #293 ---
This is the way I saw things today. Pretty much the reverse of yesterday, a false break lower of the overnight range only this time we have a chance to get onboard. I wanted to buy into the reverse that had already occurred. Staying onboard is another matter. This mornings session staying rangebound until the news takes it higher. I went long 3364. The hard stop of 10pips was in a very vulnerable position here. Not a good place at all right on the range bottom. The reason the chart shows a winning trade is because I removed the hard stop (moved to 3348) until price had retested the range just to test the idea. I was ready to close the trade had we got a candle close below 3355. If the stop placement is bad at -10pips then we must be able to reduce size keep the same risk and move the SL to a logical place otherwise we're sitting ducks. Stopped out -10....... obviously. Price moves up to hit TP +10. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi, Quidsey Why did you go long? I don't know. EMA increased in gay area.. Could u explain that? Thx.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Well, it looked like a strong move up, so.....I should have left it at 10 pips...

--- 帖子 #296 ---
That might be a FF first. Sorry Ken that made me laugh, juvenile joke I've tried to explain in the chart. When we are deciding which way to go it is not enough to just go the opposite direction to the EMA, we have to take into consideration previous session price action. The momentum coming into the grey area was coming from a support/supply level and WS1. It broke back into the overnight range which traps traders who were short the breakout (like my trade yesterday) they will be looking to get out of those trades. Fake/false breakouts tend to continue out the other side of the range. I went long trying to jump on the momentum.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
No, that was not a strong move to fade in my opinion. Hasn't broken any highs. If I was looking to fade short I'd want that momentum rushing into the Daily pivot today, then targeting the Daily open. I took a trade later on in the day short off the W pivot. Look at the difference in momentum. I'm not saying it needs to be like this every time but you see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hey guys, I'm away next week and not trading but please feel free to post any trades, thoughts or ideas. Good trading to all.

Opened long on EU, tho with tight stop at 1.3367 Reasons: 1. above the day open 2. above the range of asia session 3. above EMA's 4. Silly hoping for continuous pattern of rise and fall

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Conditional out, rest at BE

--- 帖子 #304 ---
looking at daily i think we wont get another chance for same patterns as we had this week, but who knows, previous day was inside bar, today we can end up the same way as well, so break can be strong, but cant say in what dirrection. Next week is quite promising, especialy with Draghi speach on friday, plus september is coming with all its volatility. In terms of London open, i'll wait for shakeout after 7gmt, and try to enter at least half an hour after opening.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi xau nice entry, I would have gone long there.Hope you made 1R. No reason to get stopped on this trade, another fake out pullback into the range come out the other side.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks Quidsey, i like this room, tho my trading strategy on london open differs, i'd say it's more like little bit of this and little bit of that. Asia session range could give some opportunity, if lets say it ranges without direction, and then price breaks out of that range in pre London market, often (not always) it comes back to test that range after London session is open, here is an example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) as i can imagine, some guys try to liquidate these Asia positions. I need to mention that it's cable tho. After London open some whales go for the hunt, so this could put some logic into nature of opposite ema trade. Here is another chart of cable 5mtf open and close price differential, from chart you can see that some bigger moves tend to happen after hunt is over, and these moves tend to be intentional. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Tho this is just some examples, more often i catch myself wondering how little i know in fx market, what realy moves it and what's behind the scenes. Good luck in your quest. i'll try to contribute if will found something interesting to post.

I've followed this thread with interest. I like trading at this time of the morning and then being able to turn off the screen for the rest of the day. I'll keep following the progress. You guys might also be interested in the London Forex Open approach here This type of trading suits me well as I only have a small window before having to head to work. It's mechanical calculated orders so set and and forget. There are of course pros and cons to such an approach but it has worked well for me for the small amount of time invested to trade it.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
sad i wasn't able to trade yesterday as too busy with work

looking to buy gbpusd as 15 ema is down

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi guys, I would have been selling EU this week. These breakouts come back hard looking for stops but they are continuation moves. There is not enough strong momentum to think of buying here in my opinion, don't just rely on the ema without a context. Anyway still following along, hope to be back trading and posting charts next week.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Holiday in UK today so I've decided not to trade which is a bit frustrating. Big gap down of course to fill or not, DS1 a possible launch pad higher from a DB, but there is still plenty of room down to 3100 major swing level before the bulls really get a look in. Hopefully get some trading in this week although other work is getting in the way at the moment. Some charts and thoughts on last week.

Hi, you'll have to play around with the pivots to get it the way you want. Just remember this is a discretionary strategy that's being tested.

Wasn't up in time but a good indication to make atleast 13 pips today if you waited for the very peak to drop back?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi Quidsey, What sort of setups are your preferred reversals/continuations? CheersMoonie.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I'm away at the moment so a bit difficult to post charts but if you compare today with yesterday the momentum is much greater. Price went for all the stops above the swing level and it's there I'd look to fade.Nothing really wrong with shorting yesterdays open except it was too calm, price was not really stretched, and mondays can be difficult without news.Btw Eurchf is testing close to the SNB's 1,20. Everybody seems to be long ec.

pls whats the iparomoundindicator use for

--- 帖子 #333 ---
It creates the vertical grey lines which show the opening times of London/New York stock markets. It helps me to put a frame around intraday price movement and by changing the number of days you can use it to show previous market open times. It's just a personal thing and has no magical properties whatsoever, keep it, leave it, it makes no difference to the most important indicator on your chart, price.

This is a test Emmy, I don't have any significant stats I could give you as the sample is too small, and even if I did I doubt it would help you trade it the same way. This is not a mechanical strategy, somebody already posted an EA of what they thought was happening and it's a disaster. If you're looking for stats and a fully functioning system this one isn't for you sorry.

i was just looking at a similar concept using 1hr charts, basically wait for the first 1h candle of the london open to close to determine if their is momentum in one direction or the other, and then buy or sell the open of the next candle in the same direction as the previous candle. i'm using TDI and multi time frame stochastics as well as basic price structure to make sure my trade has some merit as well. only done some visual backtesting so far..

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Link looks promising but unfortunately no verified performance which means nothing. I thought it might be complimentary if successful but.............. Is this your venture? Is it being traded? Any real performance???? Thanks anyway.
