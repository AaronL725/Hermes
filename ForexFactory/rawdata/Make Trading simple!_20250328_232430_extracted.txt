Anything in this thread is useful in any market. Markets are markets are markets and it just depends on how you want to trade. I started trading in 1995. I love it! I am always trying to learn new things even now; because markets change. Then market trades totally different today than it did 25 years ago. And it will continue to evolve. I trade using Multiple time frames. I use mostly tick charts and I trade mostly the ES and Micro ES (E-Mini contracts). They are cheaper to trade. have very narrow spread's. The brokers are regulated so you get better fills and less slippage. My Anchor chart is between 600-900 ticks. And my entry chart is between 150-300 ticks. I use the CCI, Stoch-RSI, MACD, Williams% R, Bollinger Bands. These are all possibilities on my charts. The process is pretty simple. Trade in the direction of the Anchor chart and make your actual entries on the entry chart. So what that means is that if I am looking at the 610 tick chart, watching the CCI and I see it is breaking below the zero line, Then I will look at the 233 tick chart and if the CCI is below or breaking below the zero line then I would probably take the trade. If it doing the opposite then I would probably go long. The CCI on the long term and short term have to be in agreement. The same goes for the Sto-RSI. I like to keep things pretty simple, if it gets to complicated then usually it costs me money.

This is my basic set up. The screen shot makes it look like one Monitor, but really it is three Monitors. The Monitor in the middle is my main trading screen. This screen shot happens to be the MES, which is the Micro ES contract. It has Bollinger Bands. CCI with a moving average, Stochastic RSI and the Macd. All with my own settings which I will post. All three charts on the middle monitor have the same indicator on them. So I will post images of those charts with my ES settings. I change some of he setting depending on what I am trading. Meaning ES setting are different than MES settings because the PA is basically the same but the volume is not. So I will shorten the ticks with the decrease in volume. By the way I mainly trade tick charts. So take a look and let me know what you think. I also take very small bites on each trade. Many times in the ES I only take 4-6 ticks per trade. I am very quick to cuts any losers. But I find that if I wanted to I could make 50+ trades a day many time with my system. Not all winners, but most are. You have to learn how not be afraid to have a losing trade. cut the losses and move on to the next trade. Let me know what you think. But be respectful in your comments always.

I will be posting how I use these indicators and what my trading rules are. Busy day so I am in and out. But basically I do not trade the crosses of the Macd line and the signal line. I trade the cross of the zero line, above or below. If it crosses above then long, if below then short. Same with the CCI and Stochastic-RSI. If Macd is above zero and the Macd line cross below the signal line that does not mean I take short. Rather it just means a break in the up trend. if It continues down and crosses the zero line then I would enter a short. More to come later. If you trade intra-day it is really about momentum more than anything else. Do not get greedy. Just take small profits and they add up quickly. We want all three charts going in the same direction. thanks again. will be back soon.

The charting program never mentioned, did I miss it? How expect anyone to follow what is going on?

Not my definition of 'simple'. Try reading Laura T's Roadmap thread on here. That is simplicity for you.

Hi Erebus - Each chart shows as NinjaTrader.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
So today I traded two hours. From the open. Made 87 ticks in two hours. Each tick is worth 12.50 dollars US. Times that by more than one contract and that is a productive two hours. I am a Pastor of a church here in the town I live in. So I do not trade every day. Pastoring keeps me very busy. But most of my income is from trading. I trade 2-3 days a week. I will post my chart from this morning. It covers the 1st 30 minutes or so of the trading day. P.S There are not or ever will be any currency pairs in this thread. Just futures on the S&amp;P, Nasdaq on Oil. Things like that. And yes my Broker is Ninja Trader. I only trade regulated markets like the futures market. Brokers are more honest. Blessing in Jesus name to everyone! Pastor K

Here are some of my trades from this morning. Not my best day. Was a little slow today. So late on some entries. This is my 233 tick chart. Made 23 trades, 15 Long, 8 short. 20 winners and 3 losers for the day. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
This is how my screen looks when they are all together. 233 tick chart on top. Followed by the 3R Range chart and then the 610 tick chart. This is on one monitor. I have three monitors with other info on them. But this is my main trading screen. I posted them separate earlier so that people can see how each chart is set up. This is just the basic Ninja trader 8 platform with their free indicators that you can find any where. How someone constructs the charts is up to them. This my basic set up. Everyone have a very blessed night. Jesus is Lord. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi kthrapp350, Wishing you the best with your trading.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This is my charts for today. I only traded an hour today. 14 Trades, 12 winners, 2 losers. Made 41 ticks at 12.50 US per tick. Not a bad hour. Especially when trading more than one contract at a time. Just making sure the 610 chart and the 233 chart agree. That simple. CCI is the most important indicator on the chart. Do not need the EMA in the middle of the CCI. I just like it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Kthrapp350, I like the principles behind your charts and trading. Compliments! I would like to ask you if this system is replicable on MT4? Will you post your indicator settings? I still don't understand what your trigger is for long/short inputs... Thank you and best of luck

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hello kthrapp350, I also trade in NQ and SP with ninjatrader8, I wonder if you could share on WorkSpace about this strategy that you use

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I am going to post my strategy with some examples. I the basics are above. I use two time frames. For the ES I use a 233 tick chart and a 610 Tick chart. Both have a 20,2 Bollinger Bands. CCI with set at 20 periods. And then the Stochastic-RSI set at 25 on the 233 tick chart and 20 on the 610 tick chart. The only lines I pay attention to are the zero and 50 line. Above is long and below is short. Simple enough. I usually only take 4-6 ticks of profit per trade. I cut my loses very quickly. So when the CCI is below zero on the 233 and crosses below zero on the 610 then I short. If the Sto-RSI does not agree with the CCI then I skip the trade because there probably is not any momentum in the PA and there is good change the trade turns into a loss. If we are in a very tight ranging market then do nothing. For long trade set ups, they are just the opposite of the above. These are just very basic indicators that can be used on any platform. You may have to adjust the time frames for what ever market you like to trade. But the concept is the same. For the NQ I use 125 tick charts and a 350 tick chart. Simple because the NQ has less volume. for the MNQ I use the same as the ES as the MNQ has much more volume than the NQ. If I am trading currency pairs then I would not go any fast than 15 min and 1 hour. If you look at my charts above you can see where my arrows are for the buy's and sells. Thanks everyone. Hopefully this helps!! Jesus is Lord Pastor K

I trade for about two and half hours today and made 109 ticks. I was up and down to much from my desk today. I wanted to trade the whole day today. PA was really good. this is a 1000 tick chart. Not my normal chart, but I used it so you could more of my trades. If I have time I will try to give more examples. They really quite simple. Just make sure the CCI on the 610 and the 233 are in agreement. Blessings to everyone reading this. Amen Attached Image (click to enlarge) pastor K

This is how the charts are laid on my main trading screen. 233 is on top and the 610 behind it. Both are easy read and follow at the same time. Everyone have a blessed night! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

That is awesome. Hope the info helps in any way. The principles apply about anything one might want to trade. Just adjust the time frames is all. blessings

Hi I gave a try your system yesterday on NY session. I dont have NT but i opened 233 and 610 charts on Multicharts. I have to say that i have no idea how it is possible to trade ES on 233/610 tick charts. Candles are changing so fast. It would be very, very interesting to watch recorded video how it is possible, how you have enough time to put orders. If you are able to trade it and earn money , you have my respect.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
yeah, maybe outside NY session you can trade that fast but when market is normal, i doubt you can execute in 1s and close another. sometimes you have consecutive 1s candles. You are a HFT trader. I most likely wouldn't make it profitable. I prefer a bit slower decision making, reading market in context. Good luck though.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi K, Thank you for sharing your system! It'd be great if you could tell about your exit methods - both closing in profits and cutting losses. Thank you in advance and wish you (and everyone who's reading) to have a great weekend! ; ) Artem

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Has anyone managed to bring the system back to Metatrader 4? can you explain to me, thanks

--- 帖子 #28 ---
You have to use tick chart generator, for example from OVO.cz website. But you have to remember that charting CFD is a different story than charting real futures market.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hey jmaster: I really do trade these charts. I only trade the NY session no after hours for me. Many times I will do 15 trades in an hour. My main chart is the 610 and then the 233 within that. But a person could use the same concept on a slower chart. like 610 tick and 1500 tick chart. the basic concept can be able with time charts also. maybe a 1 minute chart along with a 3-5 minute chart. If I was trading currency pairs like USd/EUR I would use a 15 minute and a one hour chart. I works very well for swing trading, maybe a four hour chart and a daily chart for that. But when I trade I do not get from my desk while in a trade. My profit is very small 4-6 ticks per trade. That is how I like to do it. But anyone can put their own spin on it and make the concept work. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #30 ---
What do you trade with MT4, I know all these indicators are in that platform. Just add them to a candle chart. If you are trading Currency pairs then do not use tick charts. Try 15 min and 1 hour. I do not use any of the platforms like MT4 or Oanda .

--- 帖子 #31 ---
So the when you look at my charts that I post. When you see the arrows (Green/red). Those are my exits and entries. Those are really trades. Yesterday I made 109 ticks in 2.5 hours on 22 trades. That is about 5 ticks per trade, per contract. I could have traded more often if I was more focused. So basically 11 trades per hour yesterday. Reading charts is just like reading. Gets easier with time. If I can learn anyone can. But really, that is just how I like to trade. Someone can slow the charts down with more ticks or longer time frames and still use the concept and make money. Trading is a personal thing and we all have our own style. So trade the way you like and have fun. I am just putting my stuff out there. If you like it cool. If it doesn't work for you then that is cool also. There are a lot of different way to trade and be profitable. Blessings Pastor K

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Just a note: the last few days have had very heavy volume compared to normal. So some times if the 233 chart just to fast with that much volume it is ok increase it by 50 ticks or to something that is more comfortable for you. Maybe a 300 tick chart and a 900 tick chart. Volume is up over 60% the last few days. But I am just sharing what works for me. When trade I am at my computer and I do not get up while in a trade. If I miss one I do not chase it. Just wait until the next opportunity comes up. But these are my real charts with real entries and exits. Thanks everyone Pastor K

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Look at the bottom left on his screenshots. Futures trading platforms almost always print their product name somewhere in the corner of the screen.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I use Ninja Trader 8 for my charts and trades. But these indicators are available in any Platform. Which is why I use them. No need to make it more complicated.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thank you for starting this thread. I have a question about your entry in the picture below. Your entry looks pretty late in hindsight. It's heading to BB top in lower TF and CCI in higher TF is still below zero line. You said you cut loss quick but you kept it alive even price moved below previous swing low. And I'd like to know more about your usage of BB. Thanks. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Another example. I think you don't cut your loss quick. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I think if you dissect everyones strategy you will notice that there is not just "a strategy" everyone are doing but there are also "experiences" everyone get from trading. Thats why not even 2 traders are making the same entries/exits with "the same strategy". Our brains see "patterns" in different ways. I guess he is doing the same thing most of the time, but sometimes candles are too fast to react properly or some other reason - don't hang him for that . It's well known that the lower timeframe you go, the harder it gets to trade as our brains get "excited" too fast that way and you can't make reasonable decisions anymore. I am fascinated if he can do it regulary so all props to him. Generaly this will be very hard to do for newcomers...i know its tempting to get many trades per hour or per session but...as he suggested, take higher timeframe to trade with. if you are starting at least take 1h and use for entry something lower if you want but 1h should be standard to get better market "reading". Make those pips/ticks/points

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Questions you have to answer(to all who wants to trade "like you" or just to yourself so you can becoma better): -do you need multiple charts (can you make something on one chart to see what is higher timeframe chart doing without checking it)? -do you need BB and how do you use them? -what is SMA(EMA?) showing to you? -why sometimes you have MACD on your chart and other times you don't (do you really use it?) -why do you use heiken-ashi if indicators tell you when to enter(i guess you use exit as fixed amount)? -can you trade if you hide candles and watch only at indicators? black them out and use only price line? -do you understand what MACD, Stoch, CCI, EMAs are representing? (can you remove any of them right now?) ... this is just for your own better understanding. i am not picking at you or your strategy.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
is it possible to get a template of this for MT4?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Exactly, those who are more experienced can generate a template with the settings they use Kthrapp350? i want use this whit TF 1h and 15 min

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks for the input but I am not taking the time to answer any of those question. As I have no need to prove anything to you or any one. I have made my living in the markets since 1989, Had all the the required licenses and certifications. I retired 7 yrs ago. I know market structure and support and resistance levels. I am not asking anyone to trade like me nor are you required to. I just sharing. If you don't think it is worth you time, then move on. It is all good. I see you started a thread years ago and never really followed through with it. You should. You never know what will spark some one the light comes on their trading goes to a new level. I am just sharing for fun. I do not create content, I am not a teacher with products to sell. Just learned the hard way. Thank you and have a great day!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
watch my lips:

--- 帖子 #43 ---
the trade you highlighted was good trade. That was not enough of swing to exit the trade. The longer term time frames or tick charts were long so I stayed long.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Also on this trade the market momentum was down. This is good trade. The longer charts were down. There has to be room to let trade work out. But I do not lose more than 2 points very often. I would take that trade every time. if the market momentum changed direction then I would get out quickly.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Are you able to provide us with a MT4 template? Or at least give the indicator settings and details. I would love to test this system out. Thank u

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I do not have any templates for MT4, I have never used that Platform. But my charts are simple. The CCI indicator is set at 20, Just add that to a chart. The BB's are set 20,2 The Stoch- RSI is set 25. Just add them to any chart. What market are you trading? If you are trading something different from my ES contracts you might not want to use the 233 or 610 tick chart.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
how is it possible that the same settings are good for any timeframe? If I were to trade on a 1h and 15 minute timeframe, should I always leave these settings?

--- 帖子 #48 ---

This is the corresponding Chart from yesterday. This is my longest tick chart that I keep on my Monitor. It is a 1500 tick chart. Notice the CCI setting is 10 and the sto-RSI is set at 14. Due to the slower chart is the reason for the different setting. On a day like yesterday when the ES trades 2.6 million contracts ( which is a million more than the average) it is ok to go a bigger tick chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
This is another possibility for your charts. This a 300 tick chart of yesterday morning. I was not trading this chart. But I could have very easily. It has two RSI indicators at the bottom. one set to 5 periods with the smoothed average at 15.The other is 20 periods and the smoothed average is at 15. I changed the 30,70 lines to 50. Right in the middle on purpose. When above 50 long when below short. I do that with all my indicators. the zero or 50 line is the most important line. When the signal line crosses then I am looking to trade if possible. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Pastor K, this looks like it will be an interesting and educational thread for me. I look forward to learning from you sir. Do you have any problems with the speed of the market for executing your entries and exits not including the times of medium-to-high impact news releases and speeches? Do you experience slippage with your strategy from the sheer speed of the market? Thank you. God Bless.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Morning. I'm fairly new to forex, but please comment on the attached chart. The indicators are the TMA atr 2 periods 500, and the SuperTrend 1.0 - 10. Simple I know but let me know what you think. I trade 4 hour charts only.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Two questions: 1. Trades you showed on screenshot were taken from setups on 1500 tick chart. Am i right? 2. On low or normal volume days you trade on lower ticks charts(233/610)?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I was using all three. But when it is really fast I slow down. Most of my entries are on the 610. Multiple time frames are very popular, I first learned about this strategy years ago from a book Trading for a living. Came out in the 80's I think by Alexander Elder. It is a great book. He has an updated version out now. Which is old in 2023 but it came out in 2012. So the 1500 (1598) tick chart, the 610 and 233 charts are very popular in the ES trading world. These are Fibonacci numbers. So people like them. Kind of like the 50 and 200 Ema's. Everyone in the industry uses them. It just takes a little practice to see how the charts work together. But Friday during the big move down at around 8 am on my charts. When the CCI crossed above the zero line on the 610 chart it would run out of gas and be a losing trade. the 1500 tick chart was still in a down trend. So when the 610 came back down and crossed below the zero line that was a better entry and going with the over all market. It is ok to trade against the trend sometimes. You just have to not be greedy. You will see in posts of my trades. They are small 4-6 tick trades. When ever I try for more I have a lot more losing trades. So I just keep them small. Fits my trading style. When I get home later I try post an example. One of the reason I only post two time frames is that it is just easier to learn the concepts. Get the basics down and then expand from there.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is an example at 8:19 my time. 610 chart was a buy which I took. The 1500 was not a buy. In less than I minute I flipped the trade to a short. Top screen shot is from the 1500, the bottom is the 610 screen shot.

A little suprise for Ninja Trader users. If you put HA candles on tick , range, renko charts it more or less doubles chart period. For example: Put HA candles on 1500 pick chart, and you have more or less 3000 tick chart. I doesnt happen on Multicharts . Below is screenshot of my 3500 tick chart. Compare it to chart from post 54.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thank you for the input: but that is not accurate. Renko charts and Range bars do not measure time, Ticks or volume. They only represent price movement. So If price does not change outside of set range or size of the Renko box it will not create bars on the charts. So if price doesn't change outside of those setting for let's say 10 minutes then the chart in Range or Ranko would not update. Where the time and charts or tick charts or Volume charts would update according to their settings. I do not always trade with HA charts. Many times just standard candles and my settings for the indicators do not change.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1500 HA tick chart

--- 帖子 #64 ---
1500 Standard candle tick chart. None my entries and indicators changed. Regular candles do give you move information. HA candles are an average of the last three candles. So HA candle are an indicator in and of themselves. I like both and switch back and forth depending on my mood. Also since HA bars are an average of the last three bars. they are just a hair slower than the regular candles. It is good to learn how the bars are calculated, it gives a better understanding of what information you are using. I do this for all the indicators. Helps understand what the creator of the indicator is trying to do. Thanks A Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi again K, I appreciate that you're sharing your knowledge and trading method with the community, and here (in the quoted post) is great example of why I had asked you about your exits ( here was my post - probably, you missed it). Trade #2 (sell) on your screenshot - you kept holding it when the price moved up and even both CCI and Stoch-RSI on 1500 tick chart were above 50 line. Could you, please, tell a bit more about your way of managing trades when they're in floating loss? Thank you in advance! Artem

--- 帖子 #67 ---
So my exits are very simple. I make a lot of small trades. So when I enter I set a limit order 4-6 ticks above or below my entry price. If it goes more after that then fine. I will have to post more on my exits for losers when I have time.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hey kthrapp350 im new to trading and came across your post, i've read over the past pages and just curious how you manage to look at the charts, indicators and watching if it is above 0 and 50 line on both charts to enter a trade and each trade is 4 ticks, you've posted your trades on ninjatrader so I see the strategy is profitable just looks overwhelming but ill study it and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
hey folks, Don't waste your time here. 1. You won't be able to copy his trading methods no matter how you work hard. He's here for fun as he said. 2. No one posts his/her real edge in public forums. You need to protect your edge to make this work in this zero sum game. This is FF in the end....

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hey heispark I can't argue with that only thing is to backtest and forward test and see if it is profitable, if K gives more info about his whole process in a trade etc,

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Why are you here? You want to "warn" us? The TS is just sharing his trading strategy for the community. There's no harm intended by anyone I guess? BT

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Said Heispark who has 5k+ posts on FF Lol I maybe wrong, but I think I already understand where Pastor K's edge is. After all, it is the old well-known concept of finding direction (trend) on higher TF and entering on lower one at the right time. Agree with you that nobody can copy his method, but there is no need to. Anyone with the right mindset can pick the concept and develop his own unique style based on it. That's how public forums work, imo.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I totally agree with you! artem_t I wrote you a PM this morning... I would be very grateful if you would answer me. thank you always. Flavio

Hey everyone hope you all had a great day in the markets. I did trade for abut an hour and half this morning. When I have more time and I get back home I will post some charts. As time allows I will go into my entries and how I pick them. When I started this thread. It was just to share. I did not have a whole curriculum planned for a teaching coarse or anything like that. But I will try to post more how to's for everyone's benefit. That being said, This system is very duplicatable. How I came to trade this way is through practice. I download every day's data and replay it to practice and learn new skills. I probably have practiced way more than anyone around and it pays off. When I Practice I usually do 20 trades minimum each time. I have friends around the world that I have met through trading that all trade different than myself yet we take a lot of the same trades and they are very profitable. I pays to know as much as possible about the markets. I started day trading so to speak around 1995. But I was working for an Investment house since 1989. Managing money for others is way different than intra-day trading. But I learned the markets and that really helps. You have to know more than just how a Macd indicator works. I retired from the Investment house 7 yrs ago. I am 62 years old. I still Pastor a Church so that takes a lot of time. I do not trade every day. 2-3 days a week. My goal is that you understand the Multi-time frames. And also how I use the indicators that is different than most. Then you can apply some of those Idea's to your style if you are so inclined. Anyway blessings everyone and talk with you all later

My 1500 tick chart. Most of these trades today are between the 1500 and 610 charts. They were working well together. Notice where the CCI is above the yellow zero line and the price is going up. When the CCI is below the zero line price is going down. Next is the stoch-RSI. This a stochastic of the RSI. When it is be the 0.5 line Price going up and when below price is going down. It is vey important for the Stoch-RSI to agree with the CCI. If they disagree then generally the price will be flat. If the CCI is above zero and the Sto-RSI below 0.5 then that is not a trade. And if it is the opposite meaning one below the other above, then not trade. when they come into agreement then we look to trade in that direction. pretty simple really. When you expand the picture then you can see all of my indicator settings. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

My 610 tick chart. Works the same on the 610 chart. But here I have a 20 CCI with a co period ema running through it. Then there is the Stochastic-RSI with 20 period setting. The bottom CCI is set at 40. With a 20 period Ema running through it. The 40 period CCI matches the CCI on the 1500 tick chart. So I have a quick reference to the longer time frame. So we want the CCI and Stoch-RSI to above the zero line in line with the larger time frame. It is that simple. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge) And my 233 tick chart Same thing on this chart. CCI set at 20, Ema set at 20, Then the Stochastic-RSI set at 25. The bottom CCI is set at 50 with the 20 period Ema through it. The 50 period CCI matches the 610 20 period CCI again for quick reference. Same rules apply.

Thank you!! And I am sure that you like living in your moms basement! Lol. I am just sharing and I have results to back it up. You just go around FF commenting on other peoples forums. yet you have no idea what you are doing. Enjoy your day and keep it moving! what you really need to be doing is going around FF building people up not tearing them down. You will judged by your words. The Lord (His name is Jesus) loves you and died for you. He knows the pain you are feeling and He wants to help you with that. It will help you with your anger issues! So give your life to Him. Just repent of your sins and surrender. Your life will never be the same. So may the Lord bless you and keep you and make His face shine upon you. Everyday Amen!! You welcome Pastor K

Also I do log ever one of my trades in a note book with short note on whether is was good, or late entry, or held to long. turned a winner into a loser because I did not follow my own rules. I have a whole shelf full of notebooks now. Things like that. I can go back to the day and time of the trade. Really helps me learn when I go back and see how I entered a trade. How I managed the trade and how I exited the trade. Then make the appropriate corrections.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
And just another note. trading is not a zero sum game. Just because you bought a contract and later sold for a profit does not mean the person you bought it from lost anything. It is possible that you buy contract, sell it to someone else, and then they sell it yet again and everyone made money. When people talk like that they are just telling you the do not know squat, yet they do not know that they do not know. See that a lot on FF. So keep you head up and study and practice. I gave you enough info today that if you study it out. Take the principles and apply them to what you like to trade you can make a living trading. And not have to live in your Moms basement like some on the Forum. It could be timed charts, Range charts, Tick charts, What ever you like. Futures, Currencies, Commodities, Stocks, Bonds. What ever. So my prayer is that you are going to make it and succeed!!! You can do it!!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
It gets easier with time. I would start with 2 time frames. Probably 1500 and 610 if you want to do tick charts. Not every trade is perfect. You need to know support and resistance and market structure a long with the indicators. That is the big picture. that takes time and practice. I have done this enough I can glace at the screen and see what is going on. But that comes with time. Nothing better than screen time whether practice or live.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
So where did that money magically come from? You could just as well say that everyone lost... then where did the money go? Very short-sighted. I guess I just "don't know that I don't know". I'm so dumb. So dumb.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I agree with you!!! You do not know!! have a nice day and keep it moving! So I apologize for agreeing with you about being stupid. But I see on your page that you really do not post anything positive ever. You just go around 14K times insulting others. Why would you bother? Why are so many rude people on FF from Aus and NZ. The only point is that trading is not a zero sum game. that is truth. You are welcome to post here as long as it is up lifting and positive. If you want to be snarky then please just go some where else. God bless you . Jesus loves you and died for you Have a great day!!

hmm...looking at your daily trade report... Do we know, which accounts have 0 commissions? --&gt; yes you guessed right. SIMULATED. Pastor pastor...you made a deal with the devil to get those commission at 0?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Dear jmaster, if one trade futures it is always a comission to be paid. It is not dicovery. How much is a comission? It depends on how you get NT platform. Generally speaking it is 1$ or less. Does it affect much overall result? I think not much if you trade EP contracts. If you would trade MES, it would be different story.

i know that dear iwan. im just indicating that sim money is easy to show profits as you already probably know.

Pastor pastor...you made a deal with the devil to get those commission at 0? [/quote So Commission are right 4.00 dollars per round trip big guy. Keep it moving!! The whole point of this thread is discuss how to trade effectively. I am never showing in the public form all the account info. Balances and account #'s. Just what needs to said to make it the point. Just learn how to trade and actually make money and post it. It takes less than one tick to cover the commissions and have change left over. Just look at the trades, put them on the data and they are profitable. So again have a nice day and keep it moving. Go some where else post your crap.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
And MES contracts are around 1.64 per round trip. Still in the money.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
So I see you have been on here since 2008 and have yet to post one positive trade of any kind. you do not have to spend any time on my thread. there is a lot to explore on here go have fun. My guess you are not a profitable trader. If you were you would do something constructive with your time. Go learn the markets and trade. I see you are in Slovenia. If you do not have something positive and constructive keep it moving. I always account for commissions. If the commission had eaten up the profits I would not have posted the trades. I only trade regulated markets. Better pricing and more honest brokers. SO just learn if you want. If my ideas do not work for then fine. Keep it moving.

I think you haven't answered to his question properly. Does 'P' under 'Account' type mean 'Playback'? I don't know about NJ, does Playback account also draw out your real trading history as well? Or did you manually put them again? Attached Image (click to enlarge) You said "These are actual trades with the entry time and exits." .......

--- 帖子 #96 ---
So just to be clear: IF you have a question no problem. If you come in and are being snarky and disrespectful you will be ignored Like it was yesterday. This method works. Use a longer time frame the 1500 and 610 if you like tick charts. Or 1500 and 4500 tick charts. I do adjust time frames according to the instrument being traded. And I stated in an earlier post. But I do not stray to far off of the indicator settings with those different time frames. that would take away the reason for using the different time frames. I did not trade today as I was at the hospital with a family from the church that had an emergency at 3am and did not get home until around 8am. But I will down load the data and trade that. That is how I practice. It is live data and trading results that can not be manipulated. Good for learning anytime of day even if the market is not open. This is supposed to fun for everyone whether you are experienced or new to trading. I am not asking or saying you have to trade my way. Because it is the best and only way. I am not selling anything or asking for any paid subscriptions, just sharing ideas. If you like them fine and if you do not like them then fine also. Just be respectful.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I don't intend to contradict, but I would not describe this system as simple. In my view, a truly simple system would involve only one or perhaps two indicators, coupled with an Expert Advisor to oversee trade management. This would eliminate the need for your involvement in manual entries, making the system straightforward.

So question for those in the know about FF. What is it with edit thing.

As far as I know, FF allows to edit posts only during some limited period after publishing.

Hey Pastor K, reading through your thread. Are you looking to trade instant the CCI’s and RSI crosses zero line with open tick bar or waiting for tick bar to be closed and new bar to open? Thanks from DownnUnder

--- 帖子 #101 ---
So this is another of my Favorite Charts. Simple, probably more simple than my pervious charts posted. But I get the same results. So if you want to try it, trade on the sim first until you are used to the entries and PA. I never back test. When I try something I am not familiar with I always trade live data on the sim account before going live. I have had many a good idea that looked good when back testing then when live it sucked. Any way hope you all had a great day! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Are you using another tick chart with it or just relying on the two different value RSI’s to give the entry?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
On this set up just the one chart. I am only taking 4-6 ticks profit each trade. Instead of the 30/70 lines on RSI I set them at 50. Above is long and below is short. I find I get about the same trades as my 233 and 610 charts that I had posted above.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
This is my chart. Some do not like 3 indicators. So here I added the Stochastic-RSI set at 20 periods. I just seem to like the sto-RSI. I do not use it by it's self. but when It agrees with the 2 RSI's then odds are very good. When it disagrees then then the PA is usually flat or goes slightly against the RSI signal. So I keep it on most of my charts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thanks for the reply. Assumed you were using just the 1 chart with the 2 different RSI's. Read that you use the zero line to help give a bias. Similar to what RockyPoint does with some of his trading and I note RP and yourself share some similar methodologies and even a possible trading psychology.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Looks good. I like HA to help with trend. Do you use BB to just identify structure a little more easily? Thanks again Pastor K

--- 帖子 #107 ---
yes I do. I removed the 20 that normally is in the BB's and replaced it with the red 34Ema. the shorter Blue Ema is a 4 period. This is just for market structure and trend confirmation at a glance. I also have a 2 min chart and 1500 tick chart on another monitor that help with the big picture. I do not trade the indicators blindly. I trade them within the market structure. Where is the Support and resistance are. High low from today and how the P/A is moving. But my entries on exits are on this chart.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
This is an example of how not to trade. At 7:45 on the 350 tick MES chart I entered a trade that was right up against resistance and the high of the day. I use different tick setting on the MES when I trade it as there is about 40% less volume on average. So this trade was a loser. Is a good example when Market structure and Support and resistance levels trump buy and sell signals. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Yes we do. I have know RP on FF for years. He is an very good trader. Always willing to share with others. Old and retired like myself. So anything you learn from RP is a good thing!!

So today, Ugly day for me. I have a special needs child that is 32 yrs old. And today is his day for our visit. So I have go pick him and we do are thing. So I was in and out of my office. So made 287.50 in one account and lost 45.00 in the other. This what a bad day looks like for me. Not even worth posting any trades really. Nothing there that would help get a better understanding on trading. Other than this is not how you are supposed to do it. I posted that earlier. Strang PA this week considering there has been plenty of volume. I usually do not post my earnings but it is ok to have an off day once in a while. Not every day rocks. Blessing everyone.

Let me know how it is going. I have not been around much the last few days. I have not checked out your chart to closely. But they look great. How is it going for you? I do not trade currencies but this stuff will work fine. I did not invent the wheel. Just learned from others then made it mine with my style. I would practice the demo account a little just to see how you do with it and what changes you might want to make according to the currency pair you are trading. I probably will not be back in front of the computer until next week. But I will be here to check on things every night for sure. Thanks for sharing. Blessings

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thank you for your comment. As shown, I have tested 50 trades so far. Regardless of whether this is correct or not, I feel that the timing for my entry is now right. The exit is sandwiched between a stop and a limit, so it is almost automatic. At first, I was thinking of making a mid-term settlement based on price movements, but in most cases the market hits either side without waiting for that decision, so I'm leaving it to that movement for now. The stop and limit widths are flexibly derived from the most recent price range of my trading target while referring to your chart. I personally feel that my stop is a bit narrow, but I think there will be various disadvantages if I widen it. (I'll need more higher win rate). In any case, my winning rate is currently below 50%, so I think it is unlikely that my profit and loss graph will increase unless I continue to improve. However, with my skill level, I have a hard time figuring out what to improve and how, so I'm embarrassed to say that I'm thinking of a way to get experts to give me some hints by showing my trading. I also want to show that I am seriously facing this system in my own way. I will continue to post. I'm not an English speaker, so I'm writing this using Google Translate. Sorry it's hard to read. If you notice anything while looking at my posts, such as whether it is better to avoid such transactions or how things can be made better, please let me know. Sorry for polluting the thread. Thank you.

Sorry for butting in here, but you change the instrument and you change the timeframe, and then you expect feedback and assistance. ISn't that a bit much to ask for? Could it be that the changes you've made preclude profitability? And personal mentoring is usually something one pays for. Why not stick to what the thread starter has recommended, i.e. the ES contract traded through a futures broker? And isn't it a bit rude to clutter the thread with so many charts that don't relate to the thread starter's system other than superficially?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Agree, way too many charts clogging up the thread --- No need imo, if he needs help he can get on zoom with me

--- 帖子 #159 ---
also agree, leave it to the professionals to post their charts. Hopefully the thread starter continues in sharing their knowledge and charts

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thank you everyone for your advice and advice. In my judgment, everyone's posts in this thread had decreased just before I started posting, and I felt that there was a possibility that it would be lost, so if my post would revitalize it, it would make sense. I started thinking that maybe there was. I also thought that it would be meaningful if there were people other than me who could get some hints by posting many examples of transactions using this system, regardless of the results of the transactions. Apparently, that wasn't the case. I didn't notice because there was no reaction from other people, but it seems like I was just causing trouble to a lot of people. I am very sorry. I will stop posting to this thread. Thank you to everyone who told me I was being rude.

In fairness to ZazenBoy , the thread originator Pastor K did suggest running FX at the timeframes ZazenBoy is attempting. Zazenboy is documenting empirically his findings. Possibly uploading an excessive amount, but he is thorough, and someone in the future may find this thoroughness of assistance. I ran the numbers myself on FX and would not use the system as presented on Spot.

Hey everyone: Thank you all for posting on this thread. In my years of trading I do take certain things for granted. The best thing that helped me become profitable was screen time. Back when I started there was no Youtube or video's online to watch and learn from. But we read a lot of books took the idea's and traded. There were no demo or sim accounts to practice on. So we traded really small until we could start making good trades. That was one of the attractions to currencies in the late 90's and 00's. You could get started for a small amount of money. The laws have changed and margin requirements changed in 08 in the states. But l learning when to trade is just as important as the entries and exits. If I traded FX I would start at the London open and maybe watch for the next 5-6 hours. Out side of that I would be very careful entering trades outside of that time frame. Simply not enough P/A to risk a trade. There are plenty of times when I have to sit and wait for the ES or NQ to breakout one way or the other. And some days P/A is just awful So I do not trade at all. Monday (11/06/23) was like that. So market structure always trumps indicators. To learn that just takes practice. Support and Resistance is vital to your success. ZazenBoy is actually doing really well for just learning. Very close to being consistently profitable. Sorry for being out of touch. I was under the weather this last week and only traded on Friday. blessings!!

Dear Pastor K, Thank you very much for sharing your truly useful knowledge and methodologies. I am new to trading and would like to ask a couple of questions if it's convenient for you. 1. I heard Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule which restricts your trading numbers (how many times to trade) unless you have above USD25000$ in your account. I live in central Asia (will be trading from there), not US citizen. Is this rule applicable to me? or it is applicable to only US based traders? My account is far below the 25000$ and i will be using Ninja-Trader. 2. You said you only trade in the frame of Market structure - support &amp; resistance etc. Where do you draw your market structure - trends, sup &amp; resistances? how do you locate/position them along with your entry chart? are you able to provide us with your market structure chart? 3. What are your main TWO indicators? you mentioned MACD but the charts you shared mostly don't have MACD. And you use Bollinger Bands, what do you watch from BB? Really appreciate you sharing again and hope to hear from you. Kind Regards, BB

--- 帖子 #167 ---
This is my main trading screen. it is 1500 ticks then 610 ticks and then 233 ticks. This what I use for the ES. the PDT rule doesn't apply to these markets. My main two would be CCI and Stoch-RSI. I trade with the 1500 tick chart. That determines the trend or lack of one. But I enter on the 610 or the 233 usually. multiple time frames have been around a long time. I found they work pretty good for me. If I can not get many trades off of the system them usually it was not a great day for PA. And if we made money it was not a lot. I also have charts on the other two screens. I keep a 2 min chart up on the screen on the right (in the pic posted). I get my Support and resistance levels there. Then, what kind of day is it. Not every day is the same. Today everyone is waiting on the news for CPI and PPI coming out Tuesday and Weds. So the market was slowing down and the day went on. But basically when the 1500 is up lets say. Then we look for weakness on the shorter term charts. if they start to get stronger again in the direction of the 1500 might be a good time to enter. On any of my indicators. CCI, RSI, Stoch-RSI or Macd. I only look at the zero or 50 level line. Above is long and below is short. I have a 14 EMA in the CCI and Stoch-RSI that for me just measures momentum. If the Stoch-RSI is below 0.5 but the CCI is above zero then I do not enter. That trade will go no where until they agree. If you look through some of the older posts you see some with the Macd. I do not use the 12/26/9 settings. I use 4/26/7. The two EMA's on the candles are 4 and 26. when they cross each other, the Macd is crossing above or below the zero line at the same time. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

my 1500 with the CCI and Stoch-RSI and RSI. the anchor chart. I over lay these as I posted earlier and watch the CCI and Stoch-RSI the closest. Just takes a little practice. What I have found that works for me. Have been trading this basic system since 1997. I do try other stuff that I see online or read about. And some of them work also. Just not any better than what I have going. Only speaking for myself. We all have our own style we like to trade. Have to make your own. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I have three monitors. So they all have charts on them. Most people post screen shots of their charts which do not really give enough information. There is not context to compare it to. So I like to post the whole chart so you can see the time, and settings of the indicators what is being trades. Most traders do really show what they have on their other monitors. But they have em and use them along with what you see some thread. If you like what you see try it and practice to see how it works for you. If you don't like it. No need to comment. Just keep it moving. Most of the really critical people do not have a better solution. They are just time wasters. So I will not waste my time. I will just ignore you. Everyone have a great day tomorrow. I will not be trading. Have church stuff to do all day. So happy trading!!

Thank you very much Mr K. Appreciate what you sharing. I am just about to start your trading methods (i have almost 0 trading experience except buying/selling some stocks/shares previously without any analysis). Do you do fundamental analysis (news etc)? if so how much ? and how much it affects your technical analysis ?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hey BBman. I do keep track of the News Calendar. So on FOMC days I usually do not even trade at all. Just because you never know what the Fed may say in the statement or the presser. If there is news I usually stop trading maybe 10 minutes before and do not bother until about 10 minutes after. especially around 8am my time there is news some times. Also lately import to watch when the bond market is having an auction. Lately Equities have been really reacting the bond auctions as they are selling record amounts of bonds and have a hard time finding buyers. But mostly I try to be in the moment. What is PA a doing now? not an hour from now. Do buy sell or do noting. It is hard to stay in that mind frame. My trades are very short and I only take 4-6 ticks profit on average. That is what works for me. There is a lot of info out there on This stuff. So read and watch a way. I did not reinvent the wheel. Just adapted it to my style is all.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Ok thank you again. Hope I will come up with many questions when I start trading your methods .

Thanks Mr K. Did you make your entry on this 610tick chart or 233 tick chart?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Dear K, just double-checking that this is your main monitor having all 3 charts together like this. What information do display in other 2 monitors please?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Dear Reverend: We have over the years developed an identical method of trading instrument ES so I can confirm it works. In fact, this may possibly be the methods that gives statistically the highest ratio of wins vs. losses, say 85% to 90% / 15% to 10%. The difference is that while we have been aware of the multiframe concept, we are trading only on the 610 Tick chart without resorting to 233. There are two reasons: 1. We see that whenever there is a signal on 610, it is even farther on 233. Thus, did you have statistically verified the fact that in some or in certain specific markets the use of 233 protects against losses ? (This may be your way to protect yourself in horizontal markets, but I am conjecturing.) 2. Looking at the signal on 610, then going to 233 to confirm it appears to take too much time. Our way to protect ourselves in horizontal markets is as follows: 3. We use EMA 34 and EMA 52. When they are going horizontally for a number of 610 bars or when they are on the top of each other, we stay away. 4. This is coupled with judging the amplitude of the price by looking at Bollinger Band (2,13). (We use BB (2,13) rather than BB (2,20) as BB (2,13) seems to express the price range more closely and therefore, for us, better.) When BB (2,13) is only 2.0 to 2.5 points wide, coupled with the Item 3. above, we stay away. We also use Donchian Channel 13 for "chasing the trend." While there have been many claims on this forum about the efficacy of such method, we found it works with a high probability not when Donchian turns up for purchase or down for sale but Donchian must exceed a previous rather distant high for purchase and a distant low for sale. (How distant? We could write a book about it.) Friday, November 17, 2023, was an extremely slow and low-volume day. We would be therefore interested in seeing your chart for Friday, November 17 to see how you handle such days. If you were not trading, could you please replay the first 60 minutes of November 17 for us? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I like that idea. I usually leave the the moving average out on the BB's and instead put a 34 EMA in there. Then a shorter EMA and basically follow the same principle. Good train of thought here. I can see how it work. By the way on different instruments I use different tick counts depending the daily volume. Just takes a little trial and error to find what you like personally. And I try a lot of peoples systems for myself because I like to learn and see what does and doesn't work. many of them do work, but I basically end up in the same trades. So the work about the same just different methodology. This is just a place for Idea's. and what works for me personally. I will put your averages on a chart on one of my other monitors with the same setting and check it out. thanks for the post!

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Thank you for your answer. I have one more question for you: You are saying that your profits are 4 to 6 ticks each. You are not saying whether you are using any ATM in Ninja Trader 8 with a Stop or a Target or both. We find that in a volatile market with a rather small amplitude it is difficult to hit our target with a Close button or a Hot Key Close button because the price may drop precisely when we hit the close button thinking we have four ticks profit. Also, while hitting the profit of four ticks with a Target in ATM is easier, we find that with the Close button we get one or more ticks less. On the Stop side, we use a fixed stop of 2.0 points in ATM. Psychologically, it may be tempting to move the stop toward a larger stop to avoid being taken out. But time and time again we find that the better strategy would have been to take the loss and go onto another profitable trade in the opposite direction that is negated by increasing the Stop. We occasionally see on your charts that you either braved the loss of up to 4.0 points and won but also you may have lost 3.0 points in another instance. We also experience on same days - occasionally - a sudden movement of price by several points against our trade. This happened several times in one day recently (I do not mean those instances when the market goes crazy and we are able to predict that because it has to do with an announcement of economic data on the calendar). Without a Stop of 2.0 points, this would have meant a loss of several points in several cases. Thus, are you using a Stop or a Target, or both, in a Ninja Trader 8 Automated Trading Strategy (ATM)?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
So I have not been using the Atm. Mostly I am pretty good at my stops. Some times I just go with my gut. That experience thing comes in handy. But I agree most of the time it is best to take the small lose and then just move on to then next trade. When I get in I usually set a limit at my profit target. Some times the quote show it is at that price but a trade does not actually happen there and I miss a trade by a tick. that does happen. I do not trade the news I let it pass and then go about my business. Most of my trades are on the 610. Depends on the PA for the day. but the 610 entry with a 233 exit if it doesn't hit my target usually means a small profit or a small loss. I use a 1500 tick and 610 and 233. so if the 610 gives a buy let's say and the 1500 is still a long ways away from giving a buy I pass on that trade. many times the 610 will turn back and continue to follow the 1500 tick chart. then I would enter in that direction. In a strong trend I use the 233 for entries only in the direction of the longer term charts. This works best early in the trend. I might use that entry 3 or 4 times and then skip the later ones. Just because the risk factor goes up to much and I end up 50/50 on those trades. Feel free post your charts if you would like. I'm sure many appreciate your input.

Powers that be do not seem to like my post. Let us see whether it works this time: Thursday, Nov 16, 2023, 9:30 am to 10:30 am NY time (new money coming into the market is usually exhausted by 10:30 am regardless of the overall volume though it is possible to trade successfully much later in the day if you have patience; Thursday was a moderately slow day) ATM Stop 2.0 / Target 1.5 and 1.0, 2 contracts per trade: 9 trades, 7 wins (1.0 p., 1.0, 1.0, 1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), 1 loss (1.25), 1 even Total profit $625 (12.50 points at $50 a point) minus $79.20 ($4.40 per contract for 18 contracts) in commissions for the net of $545.80 Note: The last trade on the attached charts was unwanted 4 contracts instead of the intended 2 contracts. This is an affliction of Ninja Trader that has its origins in Microsoft Windows: Unless you take a great care not to hold your mouse longer than necessary (which mean you must hit it only briefly), the platform will place more than one trade at the same time. This seems to be an even bigger problem if you program "Hot Keys" for the executions of trades so we do not use "Hot Keys" at all except for "Close." Attachment g Attachment g

Correct, I did exactly as stated. I tried two times. As I said, the power that be may not like my post. I sent them a message asking them what is going on. What is going on may be that they truly do not like my post. The reason is as follows: A while ago there was a "technical specialist" from a broker who was running her mouth about Bollinger Band saying nothing. The tread was called "How to use Bollinger Bands." Those who knew nothing about BB were falling all over themselves praising the author. I said that there is a difference between a descriptive model / explanation and an explanatory model / explanation. That is to say, after reading the post one has to understand (1) the purpose and (2) how to use it, and not merely that it has lower and upper bound and that the distance between the two increases with volatility and (3) how to fit BB to your market. Unhappily, FF never published my post.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hopefully it will get fixed. Have a blessed night. Not sure about trading this week. It seems that Many are already gone on vacation for the Holiday week here in the States. So probably going to be slow PA. And I have a slow week a church because of Thanksgiving so I should get out a little. Have blessed night!!

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I also expect low volume this week. BTW, I know that you mentioned Williams R%. I am using Williams R 14 instead of Stoch RSI 20. They are nearly identical but it seems to me that a few peaks on Williams R 14 are a little lower so it eliminates some losses. Also wishing you a blessed night !

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Is there a way to simplify this by creating an indicator that displays the RSI, CCI, Williams, MACD as red/green blocks (based on the criteria) at the bottom of the 610 tick chart? Or even better, creating a multi-timeframe indicator that would show the 233/610/1500 as small blocks for the RSI/CCI/Williams/MAC/etc. Look at this indicator (look below the chart) as an example for what I'm thinking about. See those small blocks? What if that was added to simplify things?: https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...0?d=1679842660

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Here is my five cents: This may be the same misconception as with digital vs. analog display in cars for instance: For it is not only the question of all indicators in the red or green. The important piece of information when I am trading is the line representing the indicator to judge the actual value in relation to its midband, the slope and the speed of change in the indicator

--- 帖子 #198 ---
This is how my charts look on the Monitor. I do not need to see all of the days PA on the 610 and 233 charts. I all ready know where my Support and resistance levels are. The most import indicators for me are the CCI and the Stock-RSI. The CCI gives me my entries and Stoch-RSI shows me the momentum. If the CCI on the 1500 and 610 show a buy a signal I wait to make sure the Stoch-RSI agrees. If they do not agree then there is not any momentum and the trade rarely works out. I do not take entries of a trade with Stoch-RSI. But I will exit a trade if it turns against the trade. That means momentum is weakening in that direction. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I am still unable to paste any charts in these messages, waiting for FF response. Nevertheless, in today's market ES 12-03, horizontal market from 10:09 am to 10:21 am with Bollinger Band width of 2.5 points or less (we use BB 2,13), namely a very slow and low-volume market, we have only 412,000 contracts at 10:30 am: 1. It is impossible to trade using the trading method described above that otherwise works for more active markets. This is because the indicators give a signal that is late. The profit potential is mostly only 0.5 point per trade, which is wasted by the late signal and the market reverses very quickly to a loss. 2. Therefore, it is obvious that the market oscillates just between horizontal Bollinger bands. It is then possible to trade from the upper Bollinger Band to the lower Bollinger Band and vice versa. Using the buttons on the DOM: 5 trades with two contracts each, all wins for a total of 7 points equals $350 minus $44.00 (10 contracts @ $4.40 each) in commissions equals the net profit of $306.00. 3. The associated risk comes when eventually the price breaks out of the horizontal Bollinger Band and there is a loss. 4. The trades above were accomplished by using the buttons on the DOM with Automatic Trading Strategy set to Stop 2.0 / Target 0.5 to 1.5. With these buttons, a trader never hits the intended initiation or the termination price. Thus, a more profitable way to trade this way is with placing a standing order at the initiation price on the DOM 0.25 point inside the Bollinger Band and move the Target 0.25 inside the opposite Bollinger Band after the trade has been initiated. Theoretically, such trading would have resulted in additional 4.25 points ($212.50) of net profit. (The described method is the one that was poopoo-ed by a reader when I described it in my criticism of the nothing-saying video on FF regarding Bollinger Bands.)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Further on this: I made another such trade from Bollinger Band to Bollinger Band at 11:25 am: 1. I placed a standing order 0.25 point below the upper Bollinger Band with ATM 2.0 / 1.5 2. After my standing order got filled and the trade was initiated I moved the 1.5 point target to 0.25 point above the lower Bollinger Band for an expected profit of 2 points and $200 with two contracts. 3. Unhappily, the price hit my target price several time but never went through it so the trade was not terminated. 4. When the price pulled back 0.5 point I terminated the trade manually for the profit of 1.5 point or $150 for two contracts and the total gross profit of $500 for the morning. There was another similar opportunity right after that at 11:29 am.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Just to finish the day (I do not intend to do this very day) and to show what is possible even on a slow day - only 876,000 contracts of ES 12-23 at 3:26 pm when the average for the day is typically 1,600,000 contracts and with volatility today frequently as little as 2.0 points between upper and lower Bollinger Band: As market revived a little after 14:30 pm and then after 15:00 pm, I did six more trades with two contracts each: 0.25 point, (2.75), 1.75, 075, 0.75 and 1.75. Total gross profit $750 or, as the Reverend likes to report it, 60 ticks that is 15.0 points, less $105.60 (24 contracts @ $4.40 each) for a total net profit of $644.40 for today. I will admit that the last five trades involved quite a bit of risk, which I cannot recommend. It is far better to take a smaller loss, such as 2.0 points, on a trade that does not work and go onto bigger and better things in the opposite direction.

Good morning Reverend: Please do me a favor: This is Tuesday, Nov 28. Is your Ninja Trader account and platform operational?

These are a few of my trades from yesterday. It is the only day I traded this last week. Pretty rusty and the fact the Powell was making a couple of speeches did not help. but made 105 ticks. Some worked out but were not really good trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Would love to see some of your charts some time.

Good Sunday to you Reverend: I am back in circulation: Ninja Trader locked both of my accounts for an inexplicable reason, which royally messed up my charts and my connections. It took them four days to fix it. I will admit that the NT person who then worked on it with me for half a day was an expert. FF investigated the problem of posting charts and said that it is a browser problem. I used Chrome: Use Firefox they said. I have a question for you: Inspecting your chart above, it looks like you made some 2.75 points last Friday. This would come to 11 ticks. Since you say you made 105 ticks, does it mean you are trading 10 contracts of instruments ES 12-23? If so, I will admit that I have not had the guts to trade 10 contracts of ES.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I use chrome and edge but mostly chrome and never have issues. That is strange. I am going to do a run through for 11/30/23 later. I will post charts if I have time. No most of my trades were 1 contract. but I did let a couple run more than usual is all. think I had 2 trades were I was in 2 contracts and made like 9 ticks. But that is a 9 tick trade not 18 tick trade.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Respectfully, I would still like to understand (the secret if there is any): I see trades totaling cca 2.75 points in your chart. That would be 11 ticks in total. You say you made 105 ticks. I would like to understand those 105 ticks when the chart shows 2.75 points cca. Say, there were 2 contracts in each trade. That would still be 22 ticks in total out of those 2.75 points. Perhaps, there is a decimal point missing in the number of ticks so 105 ticks was supposed to be 10 or 11 ticks total for the day? Or the total number of ticks for the day is just not accurate as it seems to be way off. I would like to understand this.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Seriously that chart only covers about 35 minutes of the day. It was a fairly decent P/A. You can have your own opinion on the results. the point of the chart is to show how I make trades. If it helps some one then cool. Any way have a nice day. I am not here to document every tick I have ever made. Just sharing idea's is all. Go start your own thread with your charts and your strategy. And share your idea's. Let's see what you got.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
So hopefully you all studied the tread from the begging. I use Multiple time frames. I trade tick charts mostly. I use 1500, then 610 and then 233. Those are my setting for the ES instrument only. this is my Anchor chart. A 1500 tick chart. I do not trade against the direction of this chart. It has 2 ema's one 4 and one 26 along with the BB's. The CCI is set at 10 and the Stoch-RSI is set at 14. So if the CCI and Stoch-RSI are above the zero or 50 line then I only trade long. If they are below then I only trade short. If the CCI and the Stoch-RSI do not agree Then I do not take the trade until they do. Stoch-RSI is all about momentum and the CCI is direction. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #213 ---
This is the 610 tick chart. With CCI and Stoch-RSI the setting are on the chart. Again the CCI and Stoch-RSI most be in the direction of the 1500 tick chart. When they are above the zero or 50 line then go long. If below the we go short. So is the CCI is below on the 610 but above on the 1500 that is not a trade. if the CCI crosses above and agrees with the 610 then that would probably be a trade. Works the same if we want to short.

These are the two most important charts. The 233 is great on really active days. They all have to be working together. This is not rocket science. And there are many profitable ways to trade other than my examples. Process is everything. If you get the process down then the trading world is yours!

I want to say that I described my complete results for one day further above. I tried to upload my charts but FF did not allow me to do that. In response, they said that it was a browser problem and that I should have used Firefox. The upshot is that my charts are nearly identical to yours. The difference is that I use only 610 Tick Chart, also with Heiken Ashi, and trade only the instrument ES. I feel that surveying two or more charts would be counterproductive in that it takes additional time. I rely greatly on MACD. I find that when I get the signal from MACD, the other indicators I may have on my chart, such as CCI, RSI, Williams R and Stoch RCI, are already way in the "signal" territory. But I honestly do not feel that I can evaluate signals from several indicators at the same time effectively. I find that there are a few instances when an indicator such as CCI would prevent a loss. But on the other hand, the same indicator would prevent a similar number of profitable trades so statistically it is a wash. Thank you for posting your charts and your method here. I meant to participate and not interfere or criticize.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
It is absolutely fine that you like to use one chart. So what indicators do you have on your chart? Do you use one, 2 3. Because you said you use BB's, And then you said you use Donchian Channels and other indicator plus Ema's So what is specifically on you main trading chart? Also I do love the Macd. I use it a lot. And you are welcome to post, Just keep in mind you have your way of doing things and people have theirs. So be respectful of their charts also. Thank you!! So just take a screen shot of your charts. Then you should be able to paste it into a post. I save my chart images to the computer then upload them. but both ways work.

charts look good. What are you basing the entries on? but that is pretty good results. How do you feel about it. today looked like a hard day. Especially early on. Not sure Price Action has been so lame this week. Seems like a slower December than I remember for a while. Usually between Christmas and New Years is pretty slow. I did a play back of this morning and did not do that well. but I think I was to distracted and the there was not a lot of room for error today. I am not sure I could duplicate those trades in real time. As good as the Play back feature is I still have seen the P/A so I have as idea about the how the day went. Would be nice to understand the decision process on the entries. But it seems really simular to how I trade. Let's see what today brings.

So this is a daily chart of the ES. Pretty interesting that since the 15th of Nov P/A has been pretty tight. Has some good volume days but just hanging out near the top of the range for the year. Hate it when it goes into this mode. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is new for me what I show in Replay above. For years I used indicators that I distilled to MACD only - the MACD crossing Zero. Then I realized that the price goes from Bollinger Band to Bollinger Band. Better yet, from Donchian bound to Donchian bound. When you superimpose Donchian over the Bollinger you realize that it is the same. But the advantage of Donchian is in those horizontal sections. So the decision process is pretty simple - from Donchian to Donchian. But it is not THAT simple, I realize that, but the explanation would go beyond the scope of this simple message. Save to say - it depends on the trend and the trend or no trend is signified by the Parabolic SAR. (I also try a few things outside the New York trading hours for the instrument ES that is traded 24 hours a day. But the professionals call it "the market for amateurs" for a good reason - low, practically nonexistent , volume.)

I like Macd also and I only trade the crosses above and below the zero line. I do that for all my indicators RSI, Stoch-RSI, CCI, Sto's or williams. What ever I am using. The zero or 50 line is all that matters to me. The biggest thing lately is we have had more than normal sideways action through out the day. There is always some of that on any day. But lately it seems half the day is just bound in a tight range. In the early days of my trading back in the 90's I was better at being in the moment. But I did not know any better so I was good at sideways or up or down markets. But it depends on the range. Back then I trades Yahoo a lot. It had a 2 dollar spread between the bid and ask and I could always make money on the thing. It was my favorite back then. It would go from 50 dollars a share to 300 a share the back down every earnings cycle. I just rode the wares as best as possible. The ES is a lot tighter so the sideways markets I have to be more careful as the margin for error is tighter. So we will see. But back then the was no Youtube or anything like that. I remember when I first realized the zero line is what I really wanted to pay attention to. That made some of the biggest difference in profitability as anything i have learned. Went to new level right away.

This is the answer to the questions whether this can be done in real time. It is not necessarily a new method. Rather, it is a further development of all previously gained experience with MACD, Bollinger Bands and Parabolic SAR (black dots). Below is my chart for trading in SIMULATION with this method from 9:30 am New York time to 10:12 am today: $750 gross, which is 15 points or 60 ES ticks. 15 trades, 2 contracts each so the commission would have been $132.00 (15 times 2 times $4.40) 13 wins, two loses - 4.0 points, the winning ratio of 86.7% for the number of trades and 80% in points Please notice: 1. I do not trade until 9:32 am to avoid the initial gyrations of the market 2. I traded only for 40 minutes until 10:12 am 3. Due to low intestinal fortitude I did several things forgoing additional profit: a. Took the profit too early without waiting for the price to come all the way to the opposite Donchian bound b. Did not take some obvious trades such as at 10:09 am, the one at MACD crossover at 10:15 am and the one at Donkian at 10:17:30 am.

I can see you are doing fine on your system. I was just saying I am not sure I can duplicate it. Not sure how I would pick my trades is all. Looks good though. I have been to distracted this morning. 1st day I am home in the morning is a while and I have not been able to sit down in front of the computer for more than a couple of minutes.

Eurorally: Any chance you can create a video explaining your entry/exit rules? OR a more detailed breakdown? I am equally as lost kthrapp350. I am very interested in trading your mechanism. kthrapp350: If we were to create a MTF indicator for the 1500 tick chart that shows green/red for the signals, so we can focus only on the 610 chart would that work?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Some one I am sure could code that. Ninja is supposed to very easy to code in. But I am not good at that. One thing I do is put a Macd on the 610 chart with the settings of 4/26/7. When it is above the zero line then I only trade long. When below I only trade short. This keeps the 610 tick chart in sync with the 1500 tick chart. Here is an example of that. I like to post the whole chart so that everyone can see the context and settings for all the indicators. So you can see setting for anything in any section of the chart. Then adapt it to your style.

you know it is just flat when the 610 tick chart is showing .50 half point increments. Playing with Erorally's idea and I am about 50/50 on the wins and losses. but it is slow today. Might just take the rest of the year off. P/A just sucks since the 15th of Nov. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dear r56p: No, I do not think so. I just cannot spend the time. It is like this: "Those who can do, do. Those who cannot, teach." Just like the guy who will remain nameless but you may recognize him, who charges you $10,000 for a three day course at the end of which he says to you: "We cannot guarantee you will be successful trading, because this depends on you." (I paid him only $495.00 for his useless manual. If I tell you that his method is to put a standing order one tick within SMA 52 "Midband" and hope for the best, you may (a) recognize who he is and (b) understand how "successful" his "trading method" can be.) I, being persistent, lost three full years persevering with his "method" while my wife and a partner told me much sooner that the method does not work. That is a lot of nonsense: Namely, if I have a profitable system / method(s), anybody to whom I explain how to use it will be successful if he does what I do, period. But if you have to say the above, then your system of trading is just not profitable enough mainly because it is based on guessing and not on statistically verified concepts: (1) it depends to too much of an extent on "should I do it or not?" and (2) "I should have done it but did not." That is to say, a bona fide profitable trading system must be based on concepts that are profitable with a high degree of probability. Notice that I use methods that are profitable with probability 80% to 100%. I am not going to teach my system simply because I can make more money trading than teaching. There is a "technical specialist" of a broker on FF who claims to make money with a concept that is 51% profitable! Good luck with that as it shows a poor understanding of probability and statistics. I think he would have to make on the average 4.4 points ($220) on each trade just to make even and pay for the commissions! Then there is a Ninja Trader "specialist" on You Tube who claims the "market cannot be predicted because it is random." And then he continues with pontificating on "how to trade" while making a disclaimer that "Ninja Trader cannot give advise on trading." It also took me years to realize that it is not that Ninja Trader cannot give advice on trading but the truth is that Ninja Trader does not know anything about trading, period. Furthermore, their approach to solving the problems of setting up their platform is completely devoid of any knowledge of mathematics, mathematical statistics, operations research and the like, all a sine qua non of being able to setup up a well functioning trading platform. This boils down to what we call in the science of operations research a "descriptive model" as opposed to a "explanatory model." With the former, your cannot explain and trade anything. But with the latter you can profitably trade (please see more below on random vs. stochastic markets). Their approach is totally based on having a bunch of computer programmers who code the platform and are interested only in "whether it works." "Whether it works" means to them whether the code responds to input "as intended." So it happens that while the code responds "as intended," the concept that is coded that way may be "fatally flawed." You do not believe me? If you use Ninja Trader then take a look at their automatic "Sample MA crossover (trading strategy)". You will find that this NT automatic strategy that they will always suggest you use for testing results only in trading losses. Over the years, we made a number of suggestions, many of them have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented, to Ninja Trader for (1) corrections of concepts embedded in their code and (2) outright mistakes in coding. Now, let us talk about why this Ninja Trade "expert" on You Tube is dead wrong when he says that "market cannot be forecasted because it is random:" (1) He is wrong because had this been true, there would have been only a 50% probability of winning and a 50% probability of losing and, therefore, we all would be just gamblers. I do not think he means that. I say this in spite of the fact that more than 90% of traders, and perhaps much more than 90%, lose money and do not make money. On the other hand, J.P. Morgan Chase Trading bragged 18 months ago that in the preceding quarter they did not have a single losing day. They employ hundreds of mathematicians and computer scientists educated at Ivy League schools, use $10 million computers and while the electrical signal travels at the speed of light, they place their computers next to the exchange to save the most minute amount of time in communications. (This brings the question of the "zero sum game in trading" that was brough up on this thread previously and that I would like to leave for another day.) We make do with laptops worth several thousand dollars at most even if they have the fastest Intel Core i9 chip, a $950 (lifetime license) Ninja Trader software and communications via Internet with the built-in latency of 35 to 100 ms (response time of 0.1 of a second) at best. So the programing capabilities of Ninja Trader platform are quite limited. That brings the question of automated trading. It is said that 80% of the trades are placed by computers today. But after years of trying, I can say unequivocally that the hopes of automated trading using the Ninja Trader platform are going to be frustrated because of its limited capabilities, slow execution, order of executions and the like. But Ninja Trader platform is an excellent piece of work, the authors should be commended for that, and IT IS WELL SUITED FOR MANUAL TRADING. Ninja Trader has an hour-long video in the afternoon of every day on You Tube discussing the day's events. With customary disclaimer that "they are not giving advice on trading" they and their gusts delve right into such an "advice." I challenge anybody to tell me whether, after listening to these videos for a week, a trader can say with a straight face that he was able to make more money in the market because of listening to these videos. (2) The second reason why the Ninja Trader "expert" is dead wrong when he says on You Tube that "markets cannot be forecasted because they are random" is that THE MARKETS ARE NOT RANDOM ! THEY ARE STOCHASTIC ! The crucial difference here is that in a random trading market that could not be forecasted the chance of wining would be 50% and the change of loosing would be also 50% thereby resulting in zero profit and zero loss in the long run. But stochastic process means something entirely different: A stochastic process is not random at all ! A stochastic process contains patterns that can be uncovered, studied and implemented in trading to the extend that, as you can see from my trading, the chance of winning and losing is not 50% each but the chance of winning can be 80% to 100% and the chance of losing can be reduced to 20% to zero percent. Disclaimer: From the theory of probability, it should be clear that the chance of winning when trading a stochastic market can never be 100% in the long run. I will say something about the actual methods of trading we employ later but cannot give a complete course here. As a point of interest, it took me more than eight years and hundreds of thousand of dollars (in lost income) to arrive at this stage of the game. On the other hand, the claims earlier in this thread that nobody would divulge the details of a profitable trading system have been highly exaggerated. I am only saying that I can make more money trading than teaching it. On the other hand, there is no concern that other people would learn a profitable method of trading and thinking that this would change the market. There are on the average 1.6 million of contracts of instrument ES traded every day. Let us assume that suddenly there would be 100 additional traders trading 50 contracts of instrument ES every day. This would mean 5,000 additional contracts traded every day by these additional 100 profitable traders. This would not change the market in the least. This is because 5,000 contracts is only 0.3% of the total 1.6 million contracts of ES traded every day on the average.

Dear Pastor K: I am pleased to have met you here. Looking at your charts you have confirmed what I have been doing as correct. This is somewhat unusual because there is a lot of nonsense floating around pretending it is genuine. I also have some books on trading that contain the same nonsense. Just take a look at the business section of Barnes &amp; Noble. You will see numerous books stating the obvious - namely, what I call descriptive models of the market that do not tell you in the least how to TRADE the market for profit. So the advice given freely on various websites, on You Tube and even in the trading courses is sort of "for the birds:" "Stop has to be big:" How big? How is it based on a statistical evaluation of my market? How are different levels of Stop for the same market going to effect my profit? "No fixed target:" Oh really? Is this based on the statistical analysis of your market? "Stay away from a horizontal market:" How is it defined? What is the measure of horizontal market? Stay away because of eigentlich what - because we do not know how to trade it? Etc. etc. Here are my further comments, which are purely my opinion but are based on years of experience: 1. I would be opposed to trading from charts with several timeframes on them even though it is widely talked about. I just do not see any advantage. 2. I would be opposed to trading from several indicators at the same time because I know I cannot judge and evaluate several indicators at the same time. 3. Horizontal markets - a bane of most traders. Notice that on my charts I trade the horizontal market quite successfully. - I said that before above even before I embarked on the latest version of the trading method constituted by my last charts above. - Until very recently, my charts were nearly identical with yours and the signal was when the MACD crossed the zero line. It works quite well. - The important concept here is to realize that the price moves from the lower bound to the upper bound and back in the horizontal market ! - What are supposed to be the bounds I am talking about? For a long time, I used only the Bollinger Bands.(I remember John Bollinger, a technician on several financial TV stations in the 1990s.) - But the Donchian channel has the advantage of having those horizontal lines signifying a horizontal market whereas Bollinger Bands are more rugged and they do not immediately show the horizontal market. - You need to do two things: (1) Fit the Bollinger bands and Donchian Channel to your market so it would give you the maximum opportunities to trade without many false calls. (2) Superimpose the Donchian Channel over the Bollinger Band typically based on the same number of bars - you will find they are nearly identical but the Donchian Channel is far more telling. After that, you can drop the Bollinger band entirely. - Then you can trade with confidence from one bound to another and back in the horizontal marked as I am showing in my charts even before this latest method. There is a video on FF entitled Tech 101 - How to Trade with Bollinger Bands. It is given by a "technical experts" of a broker. It is one of those nonsensical "descriptive models" and I slammed it for that reason. The lady simply says that the Bollinger Band has a center line with a certain number of standard deviations band on each side and that the width of the band shows the volatility of the market. Nothing else. No description how to fit BB to your market. How to determine the number of standard deviations (does not have to be 2), and what to do with the Bollinger Bands in trading. People who knew noting about BB went gaga about this presentation. I said that the easiest way to use BB was to trade from one bound to the other in a horizontal market - you can see that in my charts above. (It was poopooed by an "expert" reader.) 4. The Trading method: Until recently with the exception of my last four charts it was identical with your method to a very large extend. The difference was that I used the 610 tick chart only and MACD as an indicator for generating trading signals though I kept several other indicators identical with yours at the bottom of the chart. The latest trading method I tested only in Replay and then in Sim this morning: I realized two things: a. The price moves from one bound to the opposite bound b. This is really only an extension of the idea MACD crossing zero line as this latest methods is liable to capture the full movement of the price from one bound to another (and possibly back). As stated above, the best tool for this is Donchian Channel though the concept comes from the Bollinger Bands. The advantage of the Donchian Channel is in that it has horizontal lines when the market is horizontal. Thus, it is possible to place a standing order one or two ticks before the Donchian line and wait for the price to come to it and initiate a trade with the target placed one or two ticks before the opposite Donchian line. This because we "know" that the price will go from one bound to another with a high probability. Naturally, at one point the price will go through the Donchian line. By that time, you may already have several points in profit. But even if this happens, not all has to be lost - the price may turn around and go to the opposite bound as expected. Please see my charts above. 5. All this depends on the trend, either existing trend or the trend being created just now. How do I determine the trend? Apart from the highs and lows and the Donchian Channel, I use Parabolic SAR (Stop And Reverse) Indicator - the black dots on my charts (previously magenta lines, which were the same thing). In a confirmed trend the standing order should be placed on the side of the Donkian signified by the black dots. It is not recommended to trade against the trend in a strong trend as this results in a minimum profit or in a large loss. The more difficult areas are the change of momentum (Up and Down or Down and Up) plus the areas around the yellow and red horizontal lines called pivot points (this is a standard indicator available on Ninja Trader and elsewhere). The Donchian Channel is also useful when a trend starts in that the Donchian line bends up in an uptrend and down in a downtrend. This is useful particularly when the price exceeds the previous significant high or low. In my charts above, you will see that many times I showed insufficient intestinal fortitude in that I did not hold onto a trade until the opposite Donchian line was reached, which would have resulted in more profit. Those instances where I did not originate a trade in the vicinity of a Donchian line were the ones where I either did not get the fill or I was late. All this needs to be repeatedly practised. IO

Dear Pastor K: I noticed that there has been lately very little activity on this thread. It may be that only the two of us will be left and can handle the contact by private messages. This reminds me of a story about the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird spy place I will relate below. I noticed that when this thread started there was some criticism: - It cannot work because it cannot be done - It cannot be done because you cannot follow the market so quickly - It is not real! Nobody would publicly disclose a working, profitable trading system. As I explained above, that is an unadulterated nonsense. So I knew that your method worked as I have been doing the same. The number of ticks in excess of 100 after several hours of trading is quite remarkable (I do not stay with it that long.) So we have not heard much complaints lately on this thread. This reminds me of a story about the spy plane given by his pilot on You Tube. (The plane has been outdated for some 30 years since we now have spy satellites and it is displayed on the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier in the New York Harbor.) They were flying SR-71 on a training mission over the western United States at an altitude of 40,000 feet. Little Cessna came on the radio: "Air control, what is my ground speed?" "We have you at 90 miles per hour across the ground." (They treated him like a big airliner.) Then a Navy pilot in his F-15 speaking like the King of the Valley he was: "Air control, what is my ground speed?" "We have you at 650 miles per hour across the ground." (They emphasized "across the ground.") Then the navigator in the SR-71 could not resist, even though he had all the instruments in front of him: "Air control, what is my ground speed?" "We have you at one thousand, nine hundred, ninety six miles per hour across the ground!" (Max speed was 2,300 MPH.) There was never any other speed inquiry on that radio channel for the rest of the morning. There was not any complaint or criticism on this thread for some time. IO

All sounds good Eurorally, but just as a trend comes to an end so does range trading. So there are times when I do trade the range. Typically I do pretty well in tight markets when most are just watching. But I have found over the years that I only repeat the same trade 3 maybe four times. Probably not going to buy and sell just because it reached the top or bottom band. You do have a lot of stuff on your charts. You should post the whole chart so people can see all of your setting on every indicator and then they can practice. If you put your stuff out people are going to ask. I did over lay the Doc and BB's can not say I am a fan of that. Parabolic seems unnecessary as I see your entries are the opposite of the Para signal. I see you had some EMA's on the chart also. In a sideways market I will trade the extremes then wait for a break out in what ever direction it chooses. That is all good input, but just your opinion. I still like my 1500, 610 and 233 charts. Just as easy to read as your charts. When I see your chart from today it appears the only reason for entering the trade was it hit the band. I see a couple of times it kept going past your entry. Worked out today that the trade came back to you because the day was mostly sideways all day. But the market will change again. tomorrow when you enter on the band it my just keep going against you and not reverse off of the band. So I know my Support and resistance levels and I follow those very closely to if they hold reverse or break through. So I think I will keep my three charts. But thanks for sharing!! And it is ok that this not the most popular thread on FF. It is because I am not here every day. And I am not wanting to be a content creator. Just sharing ideas and letting others share theirs, Just as you have. So when people have questions be willing to answer. Many are learning just we had to. So when I can I post my trades. But that is not every day or everyday that I was able to trade. Really the people that did most the complaining on the thread were just people going around and complaining on everyone else's thread. But really did not have any productive input on trading mostly that my trades did not work. Nice little story about the SR-71. my daily driver is a 74 Pacer! love that car!

These some are my trades using my little system this morning. I did put the Donchain channel on this chart set at 14. Macd 4,8,7. Stoch-RSI set at 14, and then another Macd set at 4,26,7 Made 31 ticks. By the way if you enter a trade and say bought 5 contracts and made 4 ticks on that trade. That is not a 20 tick trade it is a 4 tick trade with 5 contracts. Just saying. I had another 5 ticks in the win column but hit the wrong mouse button and there went those right out the window.

Dear Pastor K.: I am an engineer with a concentration in operations research, mathematical statistics and economics. I am sort of continuing in similar fields as before. My wife has two academic degrees and worked for NASA in New York. IO

--- 帖子 #246 ---
You got it. We also make mistakes. With MACD, I find that the difference between 4,17,7 and 4,26,7 is only in the amplitude. It makes no difference how we calculate the ticks as long as we understand each other. I say 1 point is 4 ticks with $50 for each point. If I trade 2 contracts as usual, if I make 1 point on a trade, it is really two points and 8 ticks because I earn $100 from which I have to pay two commissions at $4.40 each.

Cool, I have two degrees also. Worked in the Markets since 1987. And then also Pastored a church also since 91. Retired from the Markets 7 years ago. Still Pastor. It is all good. But be willing to share the details if you post your charts and people have questions. The point is to bless others with our experience. Not to impress them with our knowledge just because we can.

Just saying this. I in my pervious job I had every Series 7, 63, 20 this and 12 that license to perform my job. My boss in High school was blind so I would read him all kinds of research material. That was back the middle 70's and that was my first exposer to the markets. But a 4 tick trade is a 4 trick trade regardless of how many contracts bought or commissions paid. People are thinking some one is getting bigger moves than they really are. That is how we did as a profession for decades. So I am kind of stickler on those little details. Any way enjoy the evening. Getting late out there.

I am not sure how to respond to this as I am also not clear on some of it. As you said to me before, we have our methods, are used to them, they work for us and we want to keep them. I believe the objects on the chart I explained in my response before. Parabolic SAR is very useful to me as the continuing line of black dots signified the continuing trend in one direction. It is different in a horizontal market where they show the same as Donchian. Support and resistance levels propagate to 610 Tick from 4181 Tick. I am not sure how to answer this but will try: "When I see your chart from today it appears the only reason for entering the trade was it hit the band. I see a couple of times it kept going past your entry. Worked out today that the trade came back to you because the day was mostly sideways all day. But the market will change again. tomorrow when you enter on the band it my just keep going against you and not reverse off of the band." The fact is that the price moves from one band to the opposite band and the crux of this is to realize this. Yes, I placed the trade ONLY BECAUSE IT HIT THE BEND. Several times and my only regret is that I was not able or brave enough to do it exactly from the band to the band. Parabolic SAR gives me the confidence to do it. I now use MACD crossover only in strong trends but never in a horizontal trend where the price goes bound to bound. Somewhere you say you can do it three times. This is what they say. I do not have it statistically verified. But I know from experience that the first two or three are much safer than anything afterwards. I hope I am explaining myself.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
You are doing fine, And yes the Price will always come back to the other band. Just some times that could be 10 points away from the pervious band. So I get all of that. So this morning at 9:10 my time (11:10 your time) Price reversed off of the top band. Went about 2.5 point to the bottom band. If I had reversed off off the bottom band I would have lost 13 points before it reversed back to the top band. So for me I only trade the range for so long. It is the same for me on days when the market is just up all day no matter what. Those are not me best days because I do not trust that trend would continue for 6 hours. Same with range bound markets. So when the market reversed back up at 4571.75 it went back up to 4587 with out touching the bottom band. So I trade trends like that on my 233 tick chart until the trend ends. Keep posting your charts and I know you will do well. It helps when we learn our own systems, It just gives us the confidence to actually trade. We know our little world inside out rather than trying to adapt someone else's world into ours. I like learning other system. I have friends who do very well they have zero indicators on their charts. Some use time, some use tick some use Range charts or Ranko Charts. Range charts can be handy to eliminate some of the noise at times. So it is all good. We all do not have to be the same. Just be good and successful and hopefully live the dream. And I really don't have a Pacer. But I do have a 98 forester with 208k Miles on it that my wife hates and say's it is embarrassing to park in the garage with the other cars. because I would not sell this to anyone for 500.00. But I love the little thing and it goes any where in the snow. It doesn't fit though with other cars in the garage. But I aint selling it. Lol

Always keep in mind that the markets are always changing. Lately there has been a lot of narrow Range trades in the P/A. but that will change. Earlier this year there was a lot more volatility in the markets. I saw all these traders making many points like 10-15 a trade on the ES. Then in April this changed and markets got quieter and they were still trying to score those big trades without adapting to the new conditions. And the market has been pretty quiet this month. But this will change it is just a matter of time. CPI and PPI will not drive the markets forever. The FOMC meetings will change who knows what it will be that will change things, but it will change. That is why I trade the way I do. Back when the market were really ripping some thought I was leaving money on the table but when markets changed and their winners were turning into losers because they wanted the big score I was just jugging along. Trading is a place where you can only take what the markets give you. You can not force a trade to work or give more profit. So if your system works in this market when we have a lot range trades, Just know that the season will change you will have to adapt or blow up you account trying. Anyway Blessing to everyone. Hopefully everyone got some good input form all the posts!!!

Dear Pastor K: This is why we have Stops. Respectfully, IO

--- 帖子 #253 ---
The long and the short of all this is the fact that mine (and your) system of initiating at, say, MACD crossing the zero line works perfectly when there is an active market with high volatility and rather big swings in price. The same idea, in my experience, may not work at all in horizontal markets with low volatility - as expressed by the Bollinger Band as narrow as 2.5 points of ES or even less. Thus, I find that combination of the MACD signals for a steep trend in an active market and trading from bound to bound in a narrow horizontal market is the best trading policy. The trick, of course, is in having a method of determining in real time which is which. Best regards, IO

Dear Pastor K: To illustrate (I hope you still love me) this morning (I started trading only at 9:36): 1. The first trade at 9:36 am NY time was only one point. I did it with an ATM with Stop 2.0 and Target 1.0. Before I could move the target to the upper bound, the price instantly hit my target of 1.0. 2. The second trade at 9:37:30 am was 2. 25 point. 3. The third trade at 9:40 am I missed thinking about how to write this, same as two more trades at 9:45:40 am (1.5 point) and at 9:47:40 am (2.0 points). Now we wait for UoM Consumer Sentiment at 10:00 am. I forgot to emphasize yesterday the following: a. The significance of Parabolic SAR in a trend comes from the fact that we trade from bound to bound in the direction of Parabolic SAR - namely away from it. b. This is really a significant realization: All these trades coincide with the signals given by MACD when - Either MACD is crossing zero line or - Later in the trend, MACD is crossing the average. The advantage of these trades, as it should be clear from the chart below, is that they come a little earlier and, therefore, give more profit. Secondly, the advantage of these trades in a horizontal market is so strong that they turn the loss in using MACD into a profit when we trade from bound to bound. Note: I have now added the blue Donchian at the one step higher Fibonacci number and trade using both Donchians in a way that goes beyond this simple explanation depending on the trend and the setup.

It is 10:45 am NY time today, Dec 8, 2023 and I am done for today. Trading my usual 2 contracts of instrument ES, I finished with $350 gross. For 7 trades with 2 contracts each the commissions are $61.60 (7 times 2 times $4.40) and the net therefore equals $288.40. Not to beat the dead horse, I want to show the remaining trades today, including the lesson HOW NOT TO TRADE. I have added to the yellow Donchian line a blue Donchian at the next higher Fibonacci number. The purpose of this should be clear below. How not to trade: Note the wrong trade at 10:19:35. There are a number of wrong things with it: 1. I did not place a standing order at the yellow Donchian as I should have if I wanted to trade this at all. 2. I was flamboyant (a deadly sin for a trader) . Since I already had $325 in gross profit and I missed this trade, I said to myself "what the hell, I am going to place a trade with a target of only 0.5 point to terminate at the top Donchian ( this was a deadly mistake ). 3. The price never moved from my purchase price to the top Donchian. In fact, the price never moved higher and started dropping. 4. But I was not overly concerned because I "knew" the price would hit the top Donchian eventually. This was a correct assumption . 5. But I did not take the 1.0 point loss when the price hit the top yellow Donchian because I "wanted" a smaller loss in spite of everything we knew about how the price moves ( this was the second deadly mistake ). 5. The price started dropping from there as it "must," I was hoping and hoping while holding onto my losing trade ( the third deadly mistake of a trader because we do not trade on "hope" if we want to be profitable ) only to eventually lose 4.5 points! 6. To add insult to injury and wanting to compensate for this loss, totally oblivious to the fact that (1) MACD was already in the "oversold" territory" and (2) the previous low was nowhere in sight, I sold when the Donchian bent down immediately after this loss. ( This was the fourth deadly mistake of a trader. ) 7. But the price started to rise to the top Donchian as it "must," I placed a standing order at the top Donchian, rode the price down as we "know" it would, and made 1.5 point on this trade and lost 0.25 point on the previous trade when I closed both of them at the lower Donchian. Trading when Donchian bends up or down: 8. When Donchian bends up or down after a horizontal period, it is possible to "jump on the bandwagon" as we call it and initiate a trade with a high degree of probability of success provided that 8.a. It is a a trend that should be obvious from the previous patten of the chart, or 8.b. It is a "breakout" out of a prolonged period horizontal period and 8.c. All three lines, the blue Donchian, the green Bollinger and the other short term blue SMA move close together and rather sharply in the direction of the trade. 8.d. The highest probability trade occurs when this is happening either above the previous significant high or below the previous significant low. Further on Donchian trading (mindful of MACD signals): _______________________________________________________________________________ Special Note: I am saying "mindful of MACD signals" because none of this is completely new or in disregard of the MACD and similar signals. Rather, trading from one bound to the opposite bound is an EXTENSION of MACD signals. We recently realized that the price is moving truly from one bound to another except in a strong trend. Thus, the MACD signals give us just one half of the total profit potential available. This should be obvious in horizontal markets. My wife was sometimes trading like this intuitively and successfully for years but I chastised her saying that we did not have a theoretical justification for such trading. To make the long story short, we now do have such a theoretical justification. Thus: A. A horizontal market, where the price is moving by definition from one bound to the opposite bound and back, may be so narrow that not only we get only half of the profit potential with MACD signals but the horizontal ES market may be so narrow, say 2.0 to 2.5 points or even less, that an MACD signal comes so late that it results in a loss. (Note on automating this with Strategy Builder in Ninja Trader: This automated trade initiation will be even slower than manual and will result in a loss with a greater probability.) B. Eventually, the market will break out of the horizontal pattern and there is a method for taking advantage of such a "breakout" below. But there is nothing to be afraid of because the price moves between the bounds several times and we will have already made several points in that way before such a loss takes place. This is why we use a Stop Loss in order to limit losses. As you can see from my error at 10:19:35 where I lost 4.5 points, the best policy is not to move the Stop Loss but take it and go onto better and bigger things later. C. In the bona fide trend, as signified by the black balls of the Parabolic SAR, we trade strictly in the direction of the trend by placing the standing order at the Donkian near the black balls. ________________________________________________________________________________ 9. Note at 10:40:30 that when the Parabolic SAR (black balls) and yellow and blue Donchian coincide, you can safely place a standing order at Donchian and ride the trade down to the opposite Donchian line for 1.5 point profit. 10. But what to do when these three lines do not coincide? 10.a. One possibility is the pattern at 10:19:35 am. This usually occurs when the momentum of the price is changing and the price may reverse. My recommendation is to stay away from these situations. 10.b. The other possibility is at 10:28 am (but not at 10:22:40 am that should be perceived and traded as a horizontal market) that occurs in a trend. This is a bona fide opportunity to place a standing order 0.25 point to 0.5 point below the yellow Donchian. (0.25 to 0.5 point because the Donchian line moves and we know from experience that it may be difficult to get a fill if we place the standing order too close to or at the Donchian line.) We have verified statistically and scientifically based on the past data that there is a high probability such a trade will be successful. Therefore we "know" the trade will be a success. Explanation of the terms used above such as "we know" or "the price must:" These are statements that express in a popular language the high probability of success of such trades. We have statistically verified this high probability of success that is much closer to a certainty, namely to the probability of 100%, than to "knowing nothing," "shooting in the dark" or gambling that is denoted by the probability of success of merely 50%. In other words, we do not trade based on unverified assumptions or, even worse, based on "faith." Two words of caution: 1. The certainty of success, namely the probability of 100%, is unattainable in our stochastic market in the long run. 2. Gambling in our case means the probability of success of 50% and, equally, the probability of loss of 50%. Not so in actual gambling as the probability of loss, and therefore the probability of the small profit for the house on each run of a game, is legally tilted in favor of the house. To make the long story short, the probability of winning in real gambling at a casino is slightly lower than 50%. IO Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Finally, I was not trading this afternoon. The volume was good. We started with nearly 400,000 ES contracts at 9:30 NY time and there are 1.866 million ES contracts already traded at 3:15 pm. But the market was very slow in the afternoon, at times like in the pre-market, with the average of less than 1,000 contracts traded per minute: Attached Image (click to enlarge) But just to show what is theoretically possible, assuming that we would get all the fills on our standing orders: The loss of 2.0 points at 1:46:50 pm The gain of 1.25 point at 2:00:25 pm Another gain of 2.25 points at 2:21:45 pm The gain of 2.25 point at at 2:35:55 pm The gain of 1.25 at 2:56:20 pm And then perhaps another 2.0 point loss as the market reverses and then the drill with profitable trades starts again until another loss. For the five theoretical trades shown above and in the chart below, the gross gain is 5.0 points. Or, as I do it with two ES contracts it is 10.0 points gross, which is $500 gross minus commissions.

Hello Pastor K: As for blowing my account, your concern may not be based on the actual data or testing but merely on unverified assumptions. Let it be known that this concept has now been tested in markets going several months back. Thus, I am reasonably confident based on this bona fide testing that our trading method fits the market for the instrument ES well based on the use of the 610 Tick chart. Like you, I am always learning. I am also frequently tweaking my charts and my trading method. Talking to people like you is very helpful. For instance, I just added another (blue) Donchian channel at a higher Fibonacci number, which is helpful in many ways. This has something to do with coinciding indicators based on different parameters. A concept similar to your using 1,500 Tick chart with 610 Tick and 233 Tick. I would like to understand this concept better. I am well aware that this is widely recommended. I studied your charts but it is difficult for me to relate them. One problem seems to be that as far as I can determine, they do not cover the same time periods. May I therefore ask you to publish 1,500, 610 and 233 Tick charts covering the same time period on which you would mark with arrows the exact moment when several trades are originated as the indicators on the three charts are in agreement? I hope that I am not too imposing. I have to apologize for my inartful expressions when I said that I would be opposed to the use of charts with different time frames and to the actual use of several indicators on one chart for the purposes of decision making. I want to clarify that I meant I would be opposed to using them by us in this office, not by you or by anybody else, which would not be my place to decide whatsoever. Thank you! IO

Dear Pastor K.: I think that we have a misunderstanding here: I did not brag about my or my wife's education and experience. You asked about it and I answered you. Furthermore, you made several posts that were rather aggressive and entirely uncalled for. I just found them. Respectfully, I am not going to answer them. As a matter of fact, I will refrain from any future posts on this thread and from following it for this very reason. With best regards, IO

Some of my trades from Friday morning on the 610 chart Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
1500 tick chart, my longer term time frame. But show more trades. Still it was a pretty slow day. made 22 trades, had 3 losers and a B/E. But I hope you seen the concept. This is just how I found I trade the best. Trading the 610 chart with in the 1500 tick chart. These are still pretty fast charts so you have be attentive to what is going on. I take the mostly 4 tick profit on most trades. I do this because I found that even trying for 8 ticks I had a lot more losing or break even trades. So I find the smaller trades I actually make more even though I pay more commissions because it is just easier to get the 4 ticks after entry. But as a result you can not take a lot of losers. MY winning precent on Friday was 81.82 percent. I am usually between 75 and 80 percent if I pay close attention to charts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Going to be vey interesting to see how the Price Action is today. The P/A has been pretty ugly since the open yesterday. Since there is CPI tomorrow and then the PPI and FOMC on Wedsenday. Most of the time I do not bother trading at all on FOMC days. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Well the first Monday I am home in quite a while and it is totally lame. Only 400k in volume (12-23 contract). The new contract for 03-24 did 600K. ES usually averages around 1.6 million contracts a day. So 35% less volume than normal. 10 yr Bond Auction and nothing happened. My 1500 tick chart goes back to Friday afternoon. That does not happen ever. Just means that no one was trading today. Everyone waiting on the CPI and then the PPI and FOMC on Weds. I do not do well on trades that take hours. But the Nap was nice. And yes the Dec contract does expire on Friday. So hopefully everyone is rolling over to the March 24 contract. As I was correctly reminded by someone earlier. The nap was still nice!!

Dear Pastor K, Hope you are well and things going well. I have some questions, and clarifications to ask if you are comfortable responding. - Besides CCI, the Stoch RSI have to be in agreement in both short &amp; long-term time frames? - What if the CCI and stoch RSI lines keep staying above or below 0 &amp; 0.5 lines without crossing the lines? (consistent up or down trend) what do you do? – wait until the CCI, Stock RSI cross the 0, 0.5 lines or just open position in the direction of the trend? - What are your exit strategies? Change in direction of the CCI, Stoch RSI lines affect your decision even though they have not crossed the 0, 0.5 lines yet? - What are the signs or how do you feel there is a correction starting in the trend? - What would be the indicator settings (CCI, Stoch RSI, BB) for 1 minute and 3-5min and also 15 min &amp; 1 hour time charts for currency? - Are you able to suggest specific currency pairs and futures suitable to trade in Asian time zone (outside NY session) since I live in Asia, using your method? Because NY session is nighttime here in Asia and the time zone is just opposite - If I still want to trade ES futures outside of the NY session, then when/what time would be the best time to trade? - most active period with market moving…?. I find the market is very slow and horizontal when trading ES futures outside of the NY session (since I live in Asia and when I trade it is nighttime in USA) - Do you think your method will work for the market with a horizontal slow move? Futures seem to be very slow and horizontal when trading outside of the NY session. Thank you in advance. Cheers, BB

this is great thread if ES1223 is not good today we can apply this strategy to other pairs like EURUSD or other currency pairs? thanks!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
This basic Strategy can be applied to anything that can be traded. I would change some of the settings and when come to currency pairs I would only trade them from the London open through the London close if it were me. I do not trade currency pairs just not worth it. But a lot of people do. My point was that yesterday was slow because of news coming out this week and people were just waiting on that. Happens all the time.

I only traded from the open which 7:30am my time on the chart through 9:00am. Church staff shows up at 9:00am and we had a lot of work to do today. So I never got back to the computer the rest of the day. To day was pretty easy really. made 12 trades. 11 winners and one losers. Which a better winning precentage than normal. I made 50 ticks minus the 53 dollars in commissions. that is based on one contract. This is my 1500 tick chart. I spread it out a little since it is not to long so you could see the time and price. Compare that to the 610 tick chart on it should answer some questions.

So I do not trade outside of the Regular NY market hours. If I did it would be maybe a few hour before the open. Really the volume overnight is so low the Price action is very hard to predict. Usually takes less than a hour after the open to have more volume than the Globex hours. So trading ES from your part of the world would be a challenge. Also I do not trade currencies and I have not since the early 2000's. But I would trade during the London hours. London moves the world when it comes to currency trading. I would be very careful to trade outside of London hours as it can go sideways most of the day. I but would trade the big ones. Eur and JPY and GBD and the the Canada dollars. But the big pairs. Just watch the news. 4hr 1hr and 15 time frames. Play with them and see what you like. I personally would not trade any currency pairs on time frame shorter than 15 minutes. anything less many times is just noise in the markets. taking profits for me is pretty simple. When enter I place a LMT order 4-6 ticks a way from my entry. that is it. I find if wait for the indicators I give to much back and I don't make any more money I know others may do that differently. but that is what I found works for me. Just study my trades I posted. If the CCI is above zero but the Sto-RSI is below 0.5 then that is not a trade. I want the regular Stochastic to show strength, The Sto-RSI to be above 0.5 and CCI crossing above zero. That is a buy. I want the 610 and 1500 tick chart to agree. Then do the opposite sell. very simple. Just practice and it will come.

It was triple witching on Friday. You just never know what you are going to get on those days. Friday was much calmer than I thought it would be. since Powell is talking rate cuts next year. The market has been pricing in those cuts for a while. So It is not my favorite to trade when the market is close to all time highs and the Vix is really really low. So there is no fear in the market. Everyone is playing the same side and darn it I want volatility which is getting harder to come by these day. But I just trade my 1500/610/233 charts. I have templates that use the CCI, Macd, RSI. I like all these indicators. So I switch around once in a while. Probably not the best thing to do. But I like to experiment with different things. Hope it makes sense. Just putting out there what I like to do and how I trade. Not selling anything and it is not the only way to trade. But it does work. An way have a good weekend. Tomorrow is a busy day for me. All the best in your trading next week!!

Keeping it simple is one of the best things you can do for your trading plan. Overcomplicating things does not guarantee you some sophisticated profits. Good traders always say that if something works, you've gotta go with it. You need to exploit it until it stops working out for you, then you can start looking for other stuff.

Just playing around this afternoon. This is my 233 tick chart. But this time I have the Stochastic with setting of 3/9/3 and my lines at 50. then my Sto-RSI and a regular RSI set at 20/25. yes the market was super slow today and probably will be this way all week. But made 19 ticks goofing off. But helped the volume picked up later in the day. still only 600k traded the whole day. Down about 65% compared to the average. But again if the Stochastic is crossing the 50 line make sure the Sto-RSI is crossing also. The closer they cross together the better the momentum. Again to do not trade against the longer RSI. Above 50 long below 50 short. And I filter it through my longer time frames. But you could trade this by it's self. Just have to be quick. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Same time period but on the 610 tick chart. But have Macd on the bottom then the sto-RSI and then the Stochastics. Macd 4/18/7 but I like the smoothed average to be around 20-25. Just did not change it back when I saved the chart. Sto-RSI is at 20 and the stochastic are at 3/9/3. Same rules apply. This is a very tradable chart on it's own if you do not like the Multiple time frames. Just do not trade against the Macd in this case. If you get a sell/buy on the Macd then it reverses quickly just get out fast and go to the next trade. Hope everyone had a great Christmas!! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank you pastor for sharing your strategies here. I too trade Futures and I too use Ninjatrader 8. I will be trading your system but yet to finish reading all 15 pages. I am still in page # 2 but I get the idea. Would you be kind enough to answer some of my questions: 1) Do you use stop loss and targets? or do you trade without stops? 2) Do you use a standard stops when entering? If so how many ticks stop loss do you use for ES? 3) Do you enter on a limit order or market order or market if touched order? Since you are looking at CCI to cross 0 i am assuming you don't use market if touched order. 4) Do you use ATM in NT? Do you have some sort of trailing stops to catch the trend? OR Do you always take 4-6 ticks? 5) Can I use Woodies CCI indicator in addition to CCI? or do you think it is an over kill? 6) You had mentioned that the 610 tick chart for ES is your standard anchor chart. If I had to just use one chart, would you say that would be 610 tick chart for ES? or would it be 233 tick chart for ES? I will be posting my trade results from next week. 7) Can I just use 1 indicator which is CCI which you say is perhaps the most important indicator? Can I remove MACD and Stochastics RSI since too many indiators and i don't have the time to look at all the indicators especially when trading ES using both 233 tick and 610 tick charts. I want to just enter when CCI cross above or below the zero line. I completely believe in your system. Thank you Pastor Best, Agassi

Hello Pastor: Greetings to you and I hope every one is enjoying the long weekend in the U.S. I would think that to trade this way using 233 tick chart and 610 tick chart with CCI and other indicators requires intense concentration. So should I focus and keep my eyes on the 233 Tick chart Heiken Ashi or its CCI? Or Should I focus on looking at the 610 Tick Chart Heken Ashi or its associated CCI? Based on Friday's charts, it appears to me that I am better of just first looking at the 233 tick charts on Heiken Ashi and CCI indicator first. I have your 610 tick heiken ashi anchor chart also but that 610 tick i am going to keep it as secondary. Upon reviewing both 233 ticks and 610 ticks i am able to identify so many trades on a 233ticks which is not clearly visible on the 610tick charts.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hello Agassi: I play with many different charts. But the ones you see here are my main ones. The ones I like best. My Favorite is the CCI with the stoch-RSI. So I use 3 charts which is not hard for me. I do not set hard stops. If I see a trade taking to long or losing momentum then I get out. I enter on Market orders. Most of my profits are 4-8 ticks. I do not get very many trades that are bigger. In fact most are 4 or 5 ticks. I trade the 233 and 610 with in the market structure of the 1500 tick chart. If that chart is trending up the I am only buying dips. I like the Stoch-RSI with the CCI. If they disagree then I do not take the trade. It would most likely be a losers. DO NOt trade indicators blindly. Meaning the signals have to be within the market structure. Support and Resistance, Ranging markets then Trending markets. things like that. That just takes a little time to learn. My entries are on mainly on the 610 or 233 chart. Probably 233 tick chart 60% of the time. I like the woodies CCI also. I have used it before and did just fine with it. I still used Stoch-RSI with it. If you do not want to use the Macd or RSI that I have on some charts that is no problem. I just learned over the years that the zero line or the 50 line is best for long or short. If markets get to tight in a range STOP TRADING!!!. Flat is a position also. When there is a breakout from a range I look at the 1500 or 610 chart I tried the Atm. I know people that use it and love it. For me I did not help my trading so I turned it off. I do not trade every day. So when I have been away for a while, I do down load the data and practice a few trades just to keep the chops up. So when learning I would recommend that for learning and practice. One thing when trading on the 233 chart I do not generally trade against 610 chart. When they agree those are the best trades. Hope that helps. But the system here is simple and it does work. Let me know how it is going!! Blessings

This trading system discussed here is quite similar to another professional trader. I believe she goes by "buffy" and she is a scalper on very small tick charts. I think it can even be an 89 tick charts for the ES. This was 10 years ago. Based on my analysis on a 233 tick charts for ES this past Friday Jan 12, I was able to identify profits of close to $3000 for 1 ES!!! This is unbelievable. Hindsight is always 20/20 but i plan to trade this in real time from Tuesday and post my results here and i will try various combinations discussed here. I like the 233 tick chart since Pastor has also mentioned that he uses it 60% of the time. I really want to keep things real simple here. No Market Profile. No Volume Profile. No Foot Print Charts. No Al Brooks Price Action. No Lance Beggs Price Action. NO Thomas Wade's Price Action. No Mack's Price Action. No Toby Crabels Opening Range Breakouts. I want to take the trades what I see. I personally do not feel the need to check on 610tick charts and 1500 tick charts. I will go for 4-6 ticks only just like Pastor has mentioned. On the charts I was able to identify $3000 profit. I am happy if I can make even 1/3rd of that !! I will post my entries, exits and why I took this trade here. I am currently trading with Topstep Trader. I have also been with Apex. This scalping is really good because most of these funding companies have equity or real time drawdown. Meaning if I am up $100 on paper and if I close the trade for 0 that $100 profit which I did not book counts against my threshhold limit. If I master this scalping technique then I will trade 20 PA accounts with Apex using trade copier. So my profits and losses can be multiplied by 20. Just last month 2 people got a 1 million $ payout from Apex. Yes they are all modern day bucket shops very similar to Reminisenses of a stock operator...back in 1920's NY had those bucket shops where Jesse Livermore used to go and place the bets.

Here is a random trade entry based on ideas discussed in this thread. Chart from this past Friday Jan 12 2024

--- 帖子 #304 ---
It looks so easy and simple. I hope I can make $3000 a day from 1 ES. "In Theory" with Apex Trader Funding, I can make $60,000 per day in profits trading 1 ES in 20 accounts using a trade copier. But we all know execution is everything. I am going to try this in 233 tick. If it is too fast then I will simply switch to 610 tick charts. Let us see how it goes. I will keep you all updated on my results. I am trading with Topstep Trader Evaluations. If I pass it using this technique then it is proof that this technique works. I am sure I need to fine tune this technique.

Entries on 233 tick chart. Here are the various setups based on the CCI Zero line cross on a 233 tick chart this past friday.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Another slower and relaxing way to trade based on the same concepts is to just execute on the 1500 tick charts instead of 233 ticks or the 610 tick charts. It all really depends on your personality. I know of many professional ES traders who trade on the 1500 tick and 4500 tick charts. I will post 1500 tick charts shortly for this past Friday

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I identified $1100 in 1 hour between 10-11 EST this past Friday on the 1500 tick chart. For people who think 233 tick and 610 tick is way too fast, I suggest trading on the 1500 tick chart and using the same concepts taught by Pastor.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
$650 during Friday's Lunch hour. Again these are hypothetical trades which I am able to identify based on Pastors teachings here

--- 帖子 #309 ---
So what is this indicator or combinations of indicators at the bottom of this chart? Looks like a macd with Bolliner Bands on it.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
This is MACDBB. This is one of the popular indicators. If you were part of Big Mike's trading board there screen name "Fattails" from Germany has this Lizard Indicators website. For a one time fee of $99 you can get all premium indicators there. Apparantly Fat Tails is a professional trader from Germany. But this nothing but MACD of Bollinger Bands so MACD BB

--- 帖子 #311 ---

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I am sure this is similar to John Carters Squeeze indicator. Volatility contracts then expands then contracts then expands etc.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I was trying out 233 tick on simulated data and I found out that it was way too fast for me. Even 610 tick was way too fast. So I have decided to take Pastor's teachings and customize it to myself. Thomas Wade and Mack who were students of Al Brooks use 2000 tick charts. Al Brooks uses 5 minutes charts. I have decided to stick with 2000 tick charts and take 6 to 8 trades per day. This is optimal for me. 2000 Tick Charts Woodies CCI (Pay Attention to 0 Line) CCI (Pay Attention to 0 Line) 21 EMA (as taught by Thomas Wade and Mack) Co-incidentally 21 EMA is just that 0 Lince cross in CCI!!! MACD BB (This is the MACD of Bollinger Bands) Use that Risk to Reward Tool And everything else is same as taught by Pastor. If I can make $1000 per day trading 1 ES contract then I am happy. I would be happy with even $500!! to be honest. Let us see how it goes next week.

trading the 233 tick chart is fast. You have to practice it for sure. But the basics of the system work on any time frame so no worries. For me it is not that hard. but I have been doing this for a very long time. Some times I have what appears to be a great idea then I trade it and go nope. That is one of the reason I take the small profits. I don't trade well just sitting waiting all day.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Well that is why even on a 233 tick chart we take the market structure on the bigger time frames and trade the faster ones with that. Keeps you on the right side of the trade. But any of these momentum indicators I use the zero or 50 line for the long or short. works great.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Default settings. It says 10, 12, 26, 1. Not sure what they all mean. Fast Period = 12 Slow Period = 26 Band Period = 10 Std. De. Multiplier = 1

I am going to first identify the trades as per your teachings. Then I will be trying it on my Topstep combine account. If I can qualify then i will continue to do the same thing and hopefully I can get weekly payouts

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I am now testing pastors teachings. First step is to identify the trade as per Pastor. But I have modified a little because I can't look at many charts and scalp. Between last night and now, I was able to identify 10 trades on ES 233 tick chart. I have marked it in majenta lines. The only 2 things I look at are: 1) 0 line cross in CCI on 233 tick chart 2) Stochastics of RSI 0.5 line cross to indicate momentum If these 2 criteria is met then enter a market order and put a 4 tick profit target. 10 trades all winners since last night in theory. LOL as I am typing this there was a 0 line cross and 0.5 line cross in stochastic RSI. Attached are my chats from last night. Again these are "potential hypothetical trade ideas". I am thinking this can be translated to real money. I like 233tick charts overnight hours. It is just retail and markets are slow. I need to try this in NY RTH and see how it feels. @Pastor: Please feel free to comment and give me some free coaching. I am a struggling trader. I have lost close to $150,000 in the last 25 years trading. My goal is just to make $1000 per day which can keep a real job away.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
@Pastor: Firstly, thanks for your teachings. I have a question for you. When you say "look at the 0 line cross and 0.5 line cross" 1) Do you look at the 0 line cross in the CCI indicator which is set to 20? 2) Do you look at the 0.5 line cross in the Stochastics of the RSI Indicator which is set to 25? Please clarify. Thank you

I took 4-5 ticks heat. But the trade worked out as taught by the pastor. I am trading 10 lot in a simulator. Obviously if you have $50,000 margin it is possible to take this trade or you need to have a $300K account with Apex.

Another trade another profit. I am only going for 4 ticks not 6 ticks. I took 4-5 ticks "heat" I entered when CCI crossed the 0 line and Stochastics RSI crossed the 0.5 line on a 233 tick I put a 4 tick profit targe But then it took a U turn there was a 0 line cross and 0.5 line cross in the opposite direction. Instead of reversing my trade i stuck to my trade and peeked at 610 tick chart which showed me a green candle So it is not that easy in real time There are nuances and the 4-5 ticks drawdown

Multiple choice questions (No cheating allowed) Trader enters a long entry on 1 Contract in ES based on 233 tick chart CCI 0 line crossings and 0.5 crossings in the Stochastics of the RSI Indicator. After entering the trade he finds out that The CCI in the 233 tick is now pointing downwards and is going down He should: A) Exit the long and enter a short entry on 1 ES B) Exit the long on 1 ES and enter a new short on 2 ES C) Do Nothing D) Look at the higher time frame 610 tick chart and do whatever it tells you E) Look at the higher time frame1500 tick chart and do whatever it tells you What should the trader do?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I think the answer is look at the higher time frame chart! But not sure which one of the 2 higher time frame charts

This is a break down of Friday. I did a replay yesterday and this morning. Not my best day but a good one. I trade better when it is real as I am paying better attention to the details. but just using the stuff I posted above. Just take commission out of it. Around 185.00 dollars in commissions. So an ok day. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Fantastic Pastor. Is it enough for me to just look at the 233 tick and 610 tick and skip the 1500 tick? Also you look for 0 line in CCI and 0.5 line in Stochastics of RSI right? Thank you

This is mine from today. Real time but on a simulator. Disregard the $ amount but look the profit factor and % Profitable. I was trading 10 lots and 40 lots so unrealistic..

@Pastor: Any other tips or insights? I think you have tremendous discipline to trade without stops. I eventually double down and end up blowing my account. How can I develop such discipline that you have? How can I cut my losses as quickly as you do?

I don't have the discipline to get out quickly like you Pastor. What should I use a good stop loss? Would a 8 tick stop with a 4 tick target good?

You do not have to have the 1500 tick chart up all the time. It is one thing to trade sim but another with the real live trading. So I do my best to not trade against the trend. If you want to scalp then small bites is the best way to win. Take it slow and cut losers quickly. I am not here to create a bunch of content. Just sharing a few idea's. When you start trading live I would trade one micro contract until you have proved to yourself you can be profitable consistently. on Micro's I would use a 130 tick chart and a 300 tick chart and a 800 tick chart with the settings on the indicators the same. I am not on here all the time. so best to you. The 1500 tick comes in handy when it trends. I would buy the pull backs against the trend until the trend ends. When trading ES intra day trends can last 15 minutes or go for an hour or more.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Appreciate your input. Thank you very much. I am trading with Topstep trader and Apex which is entirely different ball game. Just need to qualify first then some payouts monthly.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
So for comparison. My results were 1 contract. I think I had a three that were 2 contracts. And over time you get a feel for the P/A and some times I just get out as it is taking to long. I can always get back in.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
It is ultimately "feel" and what goes on inside your head and how you interpret all these indicators and PA. I will keep practicing and I hope I can get as good as you.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I am laughing, You are probably better than you know. Most just need a little confidence and stop looking for the prefect indicator and just get good at trading anything. I started with naked charts. Just focusing on what is happening right now today. Is great practice and many trade that way.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Slow trades on 4500 tick chart. I like slow trades for $200 stops and profit targets in ES. Just trade the crosses of MAD or any 0 line indicator

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I am exploring the idea of just trading ES on a 4500 tick chart and CCI 0 line cross. Long above and short below with $200 stops and targets. Does it work?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Based on the above chart, you could have made $450 profit with a stop of $150. Just trading 0 line CCI on a 4500 tick chart. No thinking. No context. Just blindly trading CCI 0 line cross Would this work? Whenever I use my brain and think I am wrong. So i need a mechanical strategy. I need to have faith in something. How about CCI 0 line cross?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Scalping for 1 point in ES is not for me. I don't want to compete against the machines and algos and Renaissance who hire PhDs in Computer Science and Math. How can we retail possibly compete? People like the flipper from Germany have made 40 million per year trading bunds. There is the founder of trading technologies who traded 1000 ZB for 1 tick on the floor. To scalp, you need size. You need balls of steel. I will put my faith in CCI 4500 tick 200 stops and targets.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
On a 4500 tick chart you see CCI is way above the 0 line but the candle is red. What is likely to happen? go long or short?

@Pastor: You have opened my eyes on CCI and Stochastics of RSI Indicators. I never realized how powerful they are until I had stumbled upon this thread.

So today I traded for about an hour and half the had meetings the rest of the day. But made 81 ticks on 19 trades. 19 winners and 0 losers today. Most were just 4-6 ticks profit. Not very often I don't have any losers. I am sure that if I was able to sit in front of the computer longer I would have had my share. But this the my 233 tick chart today. I have about 6 of these saved in my software, each is different. two Macd's and a Stoch-RSI on this one with the BB's Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It is amazing how much attention is being paid the the 10yr Bond auction these days. That never used to be the case. But lately they have been selling a record amount of Bonds and it has really effected the yields. Thus you see the P/A really pick up at 11:00am my time. P/A was pretty boring until then.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Really interesting scalping system. Let's see if I do it right. Green for hourly and Red for 15m. 20/20CCI and 20/25 StochRSI. I look for scalping 12 pips per trade. Also remain 12 pips SL at the same time. Entry: Both indicators disagree to agree between H1 and 15m. Ex. H1 bullish but 15m bearish. Either 15m agrees with H1 or H1 agrees with 15m.

Do you use Heikin Ashi to confirm the signal? How do you use bollinger bands?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
No, I just like the look of the chart. I like the Sto-RSI. If that is in conflict with the other indicators. then no trade. If the CCI is crossing above the zero line but Sto-RSI is below the 0.5 line then that is not a good entry. Also If the 25 period RSI is above the 50 line then I only trade long, if below then I only trade short. You want a confluence of all three. Works pretty good a filtering out bad trades.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Thanks. It helps a lot. I am so confused with heiken ashi and BBands.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I have a lot of charts that are not HA charts. If you do not like the Bolllinger bands one does not have to use them. The blue EMA is 34 periods. That is just to help confirm the trend. Price is above is long and below is short. The BB's are just good to see when momentum picks up or begins to slow down. Ranging verses trending. Trending markets stick close to one of the outer bands in what ever direction it is going. When price moves a way from the band it many times reverts back the mean or the average in the middle. that is a good place to start looking for another trade. I study each indicator to see what the creator was trying to do. So that I understand what the indicator is measuring and telling me as a result. Helps to understand what the P/A is doing. Gives me understanding and confidence. Hope that helps

This post deserves more attentions. The strategy works very well among markets. May I ask that how do you determine the parameters of the indicators? And how do you choose different indicators to improve your system? I really want to know your thought process.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
My chart today +41 ticks before FOMC Minutes Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #373 ---
So a little on my thought process is that in the futures market things can change pretty fast. So I have to good at trading both sides of the market. I have to be able to go long and 60 seconds later go short the market. I have to have a repeatable system that works on any time frame. My settings are pretty standard. 14-20 is very standard CCI setting. RSI is usually 8-20. The Macd I do not use the standard settings and I do not trade the cross of the Macd and signal lines. On all of these indicators I trade the zero or 50 line. Above is long and below is short. Now if my longer term indicator is up and the shorter term indicator is below then I might trade off of the regular setting. The CCI, RSI, Sto-RSI, Macd what ever I have up have to agree. IF the CCI is up above the zero line and the Sto-RSI is below, that is not a trade. There is no momentum and usually it turns into a losers. But really it pay to keep it simple.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
On the chart @ 9.23am you entered the second short @ 8.09am the RSI is on the floor. You lost that trade Why would you short something when the RSI is smashed on the floor? In kindness, that's just crazy, though jst my opinion and your money your call, would love to know why?

"Hello, I am a programmer in NinjaTrader 8, and I really like your method. I would be tempted to code it in NinjaScript. Can you please formally explain to me the entry and exit rules of your trades? I will make a list of what I understood; could you please confirm if it is correct? Enter at the cross above of the 0 level on CCI on the longer timeframe. (entry long) The Stoch(rsi) must be greater than 0.5. (entry long) To validate the trade, check smaller timeframes to ensure that CCI and Stoch(rsi) are in agreement with the longer timeframe." (cci above level 0 and Stoch(rsi) above 0.5) (entry long) for the short side is the opposite.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
That is correct. Sto-Rsi does not work well by it's self. But when the CCI is crossing above the zero line, we want the Sto-Rsi to being doing the same. If the Sto-Rsi and the CCI do not agree, then the trade usually goes nowhere. CCI is better at direction and the Sto-Rsi is better at momentum. The closers they cross together, meaning the less bars between when they cross the better the signal. Many times I have a longer CCI on the bottom like 45 periods. This represents a longer 1500 tick chart. Works very well in trends. There are many short trends through out the day in the futures market. I also do the same thing with Macd and RSI and Stochastics. But Which ever I use I always include the sto-Rsi with them. Could be used on any type of chart, tick, Range, Renko, Volume charts and on any time frame. From inta-day to swing trading.

RSI and CCI working together with Sto-Rsi. Again on all these charts I am using the zero of 50 line as a signal. These are the 610 tick charts. I have the same setting on the 233 chart that is up beside these. But you can use longer or shorter time frames if that is what you are comfortable with. The principle works on any time frame. which what makes it a good system. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

my current 233 tick chart With CCI at 20, Sto-Rsi at 25 and a longer CCI at 50 periods Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I generally enter on the 610 and exit on the 233. I take a lot of small profits so most of my trades are 4-8 ticks. I am not that good or patient with the longer trades. I found when I go for more I was losing on a lot of trades or they coming back to my 4-8 ticks and then the trailing stop would get me out. So I just started taking the smaller trades all the time. But you want everything working together. If the 233 goes against the 610 then I look get out win or lose.

Hope that all makes sense. Ask a way if anyone has any questions. Happy trading.

thank you so much for you time, that is correct for the entry?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Great entry. For me I set a limit 4-8 ticks above me entry. If it does not reach that before the Sto-Rsi crosses back below then I might exit win or lose. Depends on Price action. But there is so much ranging in the market lately. I just take the smaller trades. Usually the Sto-Rsi will be the first to reverse direction. That means we are losing momentum. Then I might take what profit I have or stop out. Or of coarse then take the 4-8 ticks. Which ever comes first. Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
New to the forum and wanted to contribute to this thread. I took each trade setup and marked them on my chart today between 9:30 and Noon EST. Here are the results and the trade times. I would like to have someone check my entries, if possible. I took them on the 610 tick chart, the 233 started the process every time. I set my target to 4 ticks and my stop to 8. The tool I use allows me to play with the stops and targets and that was about the best. Thanks for all the info.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I like this post. I will go through the trades. But the first three look great. I think I saw that the winning percentage was around 75-85 percent. Which is what I generally do. I usually do not lose 8 ticks that often as i have done this a while and many times I might lose maybe 4 or 5. That would not change the results much. But what I like is, that the back test is just systematic. Which means if you follow the rules to the letter. Then you still make money with out a big draw down. When I have big draw downs it is because I took my eye off the ball and am doing something wrong and I need to back and review my trades and see what I did wrong.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
So Trade number three at 8:00am or 10:00 your time is a good example. As soon as you entered, the next three bars were all red and down by 12 ticks. that does happen in the futures market. And it happens on any time frame. Then I see trade 4 was a good entry and suffered the same fate. that is going to happen. But then the next 8 were all winners. Also you can go for 8 ticks or more and just make sure your trailing stops are set so that a winner does not turn into a loser. So it can be optimized. it depends on the day and the Price Action we are seeing.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
All these trades do check out. Some of them would be right on the edge. So you can trust the results that you posted. I was gone most of today and the doctors so I got back just before the close. Be far the best trading day in a while. Which is nice to see.

Hello guys I'm new in forexfactory. The reason I joined is to share and also look for help on my trading story. My story: I've been looking for a possible grid and martingale strategy. And I found one! It is the best strategy Ive ever seen. It has been profitable for about 6 years now! I stalked the EA online, reading Its trade history and it is so simple. I already figure out the lot size and pip spacing the EA is using, but the problem is that I cant figure out how the EA choose to open the starting trade. Below is the image and the TPL attached where you can analyze what the EA entry logic is. The EA is using EURUSD pair in 1H chart and enter the opening of the BAR.. The entry is the yellow line and the end of the grid is the blue line. I tried to use Stochastics (5,3,3), when the signal line is above 50 it start to SELL of below it BUY. Using Stochastics the trade direction whether to BUY or SELL is accurate. But there is a gap where the EA did not trade and wait for a couple or hours So I am sure it is not stochastics or not only stochastics the EA is using. Can you help me figure out how the EA entry logic works, If you can figure it out I will code the EA and share it to you.. Might be the grail of Grid and martingale.

I've been trading for a while now, The yellow line seems crucial, might be tied to bar openings. Considering Stochastics, but there's a time gap. Maybe it's blending indicators? I've seen my fair share of grid and martingale strategies. While it's tempting to jump on something that seems like a sure thing, these strategies can be pretty risky, especially for beginners.

Morning Pastor! Hope your day is starting well. To say that I trade would be too much hehe...I´m still a newbie here. I have been analyzing the futures market, especially ES and NQ for the last 2 years. I have always done sim trading (not real) and in the last 2 months I created an evaluation account that I am about to blow up in any case... I have watched hundreds of videos, read and spent hours looking at graphs but I have never been able to find my edge during these years, so I´m always a learner. I have been following your thread, since it seems to me that your way of organizing graphs, indicators and interpreting signals makes a lot of common sense. Unfortunately, despite this great help that you share, I can't be consistent and I don't understand what I could be doing wrong. (Obviously not having your brain and eyes count a lot in my unprofitability I imagine haha) but I don´t loose the hope as I really need some changes because of life struggles...losing faith lately really. So let´s get to work! Here is my grahps analysis for yesterday, As I say lot of mistakes still from my part and not profitable, but here we are Thank you for your time! H.

Two first trades of the day, both looses, I realize that much times CCI on 610 tick get to 0 level and reverse up so I wait for the next bar to close to confirm that it continues to go down and cross 0 level, when the next bar closes, CCI line appear to be so down already and seems it´s late to enter and start to reverse. ( sometimes full reverse and other just a little to continue down after, but already hit my stop loss of 4-5 ticks. That´s the case today with these two.

My first trade I hit the wrong button with mouse, wanted to sell but bought. then had to reverse. Down three points because of fat fingers. I don't post much during the day. So let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
So this was my day today. 91 ticks. this is my 2 minute chart. Which I use just to see the big picture for the day. I do noy usually trade off of it. But it shows the whole day with all my trades. I made 32 trades. I think I had 6 loses and 3 B/E's Most trades are 4-6 ticks profit for the winners. If it looks like I missed a signal then I probably did. All the info for setting are on the charts. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Pastor, I'm going to setup your chart on Tradovate and see if I can replicate your results. MT4 doesn't have tick charts.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Don't be afraid to make adjustments to it to fit your style and make it your own. We all trade a little different. So let me know how it goes. Blessings

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Thanks for your encouragement. Sadly, the Tradovate chart goes blank after I select tick chart and input the number of ticks. It seems to be a common problem faced by others as well. It doesn't matter as this thread has already made me rethink what is possible.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
The concept works on any type of chart. Time or Range charts whatever works for you.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Never had a problem with that. Have you contacted support?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Doubtful support wud reply as it's the free trial page accessed from here https://trader.tradovate.com/try-it On reddit theres a thread on it. The other problem is that the zoom in button doesn't work, thus squeezing the chart, but the zoom out button works. Browser is the latest version of Firefox.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Is it possible to have the indicator settings for mt4 Android please? Because I'm not often in front of my PC screen. THANKS . (I'm a little lost with the tics stories)

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Then why not dpwnload the desktop app and sign up for a 2 week trial account? Then it should work.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I did think about it......lets see on Monday. My Friday results using a similar method to this were very disappointing. Paper loss was about 23 ticks on 8 trades with only 2 wins using a stop of 6 ticks. How did you fare? Pastor seems to be using Ninjatrader, I have a free license key but no data.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
How did that go? I did ok, thanks. NFP days are usually generous. I don't trade the model shared here though.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
After registering, I downloaded the software and was able to get the tick chart. It moves much faster compared to the M1 chart, so I went back to using the M1 chart. Net result was profitable, but just barely with profit of $7. It could easily have gone into a loss. I'm not using the exact same system posted here as I couldn't find the Stoch Rsi in Tradovate so I used 2 CCI panes with different lengths. I'll try it for a few more days and if I can't get it to work I'll look out for something else.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hey Verde Post a pic of your chart. This is one I have been trading lately. Bollinger bands. It deleted the MA in the middle of the bands and replaced it with a 34 ema. Then a CCI at 14 or 20 periods. Then my Sto-RSI set at 20 and then a Longer CCI set at 40. I have been doing pretty well with this one. I do a lot of reading and have certain youtube channels I like. So I saw this on TraderDNA on youtube. They have a good channel with a lot of different trading systems So I have tried a lot of them and they work. this is one of my favorites. Simple and effective. Those are always the best. But all three indicators have to be going in the same direction, above the zero line. And price has to be above the 34ema. Here is a link to their video.

You can find Stoch RSI among community indicators. There's an option on the Indicators menu for exploring those.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Thanks Pastor, I've watched most of the CCI vids on Utube Right now I've put up a 14 and a 50 CCI, here it is. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks, I found the Latter day trader Stoch RSI indicator in Community indicators, clicked install but the indicator doesn't get added.

You may need to wait for a while, or restart the app.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
On Tradovate I really like this version of CCi, with settings 25 and 13. It's a 700 tick chart.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Yesterday I got butchered using it. It works fine in a fast moving market but falls flat when when the market starts ranging which is the problem with most systems. This might be better suited for forex or stocks which are more trending. The total loss was sim $400, but what was worse was that my stop got taken out 2-3 times and then it moved in my direction. Is my 6 tick stop too small for a M1 chart, what shud be the stop size/take profit for an M3 chart? The other thing I noticed is that it doesn't move more than 4 pts in 1 direction before reversing so if you cannot get in and out at the exact top and bottom. its hard to make any profit from it. Today I'm going to check if the other indices are not as choppy.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hey Verde, ranging markets can be hard for sure. This week is triple witching for futures and option contracts. The march contract for ES and the like expire at 7:30am my time. Which when the NY session opens. So the Thursday before can be a mess. A lot of people are rolling the contracts to the new one and it kind of messes with the P/A. The last two days of a contract are not me favorites. I did not make much until after 11:00am my time which is Mountain time in the US. Markets are pretty choppy right now. that happens when we hang out near the all time highs and there is not a lot of people on the sell side. Vix is really low right now. Everyone is looking for that first rate cut in the US. Keep practicing, I would adjust me stops to the market. Some times when it really ranges you get stopped out and then it goes right where you thought in the first place. So I track the market with a 1500-2000 tick chart also. I will post one. I use the CCI and Sto-Rsi on that one too, When the markets are slow Then it pays to not trade before the 610 and 1500 agree. Yesterday had a lot of volume but price did not go far. Typical of the contract roll over week.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Always trade the market structure first before the indicators. So if it goes into the tight range then I slow down and stop trading until it breaks the structure. But generally for me I don't have many losing days trading this. The ES has a lot of ranging to a short trend to ranging again every day. Just part of the P/A moves anymore. I find the ES easier to trade than the MES just because there is more volume at any given price point. But that is just me.

Verde post a chart, the whole chart so I can see everything with your real entries and exits. then we can go over it. Have a great day.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Noticed your charts always look like this. I wish I'd got the market when it was moving both ways I traded the first 3 hrs only, after which I went to bed as it was well past midnight. Also going to change over to the 1500 tick chart instead of the M1 chart for today to see if it makes any difference. Chart is exactly the same as in the vid you suggested.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hi kthrapp350, I just subscribed to your page. I would like you to explain your methodology step by step, as I am new to trading. My language is French. Thanks you

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Pastor, your experience seems to be the difference. 1 win of 8 ticks followed by 4 losses totaling 24 ticks, stop taken out even tho direction was ok. After that, I left it. Followed the system rules to the letter. Net loss of 16 ticks. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The system shud work on anything that isn't so choppy. There is no trend at all even on a 1500 tick chart. The Nasdaq 100 was no better, result wud have been the same had I traded it.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
What frames do you trade with this strategy, sir?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
These are my charts from Friday morning. This is what I will be trading all this week. these two chart are on the MES and the one is a 700 tick chart with at CCI at 10 and the Sto-Rsi at 14. The second chart is a 275 tick chart with the CCI at 20 and the Sto-Rsi at 20. If I was trading the ES the tick charts would be 1500 and 610 with the same indicator settings. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hey Verde, do not get discouraged. I would not set my stop at 6 ticks. The ES and MS are to choppy and you will get stopped out of a good trade. Just try the last High or last low as a stop. lately that has been harder for me, it seems every time I get in it right away goes 8 or more ticks against me. If the market is in a trend then take the signal in the direction of the trend. But if the trend is changing, maybe wait for the second signal on the short term chart in the direction of the new trend. If it doesn't give you one then don't worry about it just wait. It does take practice. When I have not been around to trade every day. Then I do down load the data and do a 20 trade or so replay. Just to keep my chops up. And of coarse if it is in the ranging mode be very careful how you trade. Ranging markets can blow an account pretty fast. So study market structure and trade the indicators with in the construct. but it does take time and practice. I still record all my trades. because some times I get lazy and get into some bad habits. Then I end up with more losses and no one wants that. Blessings

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi Pastor, 4 continuous days of losing did upset me, so yesterday I tried my hand at trading pure price, only lower highs and support/resistance. The first 2 trades were bad with a loss of about $300 but then I managed to cover it and ended up with some $600 in sim profits. It was a trend day so everyone must have made money, lets see how it goes an a grinding day. I'm using larger stops as you suggested and buying on dips although it takes some getting used to. I'm going to trade the same way today and hopefully the result will be the same. the hour before the market opens and the next 2 hrs seem to be the best time to trade with plenty of movement.

How did today go Verde?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks, 2 wins and 2 losses. Both losses were when the market was going sideways so only 4 ticks lost. Net profit of $137 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I was away from the computer during the 2 best moves of the day. The first one was a sitting duck......a bounce off support Attached Image (click to enlarge) Traded for only 3 hrs, the first premarket hour and 2 hours after. Looks like I missed some major moves but was feeling sleepy and went to bed. Looks like it was a money printing day. How did you fare?

That sounds good Verde. I have special needs son. He has been keeping my busy this week. So I have not been in front of my screens a lot. I miss the first hour or so of trading and then have to leave with a couple of hours to go. So today I traded the ES a little but it was not moving when I was home. It was just stuck at resistance most of the time. Then slowly pulled back from that. But really price just seem really choppy. So I did trade the MNQ a little also. Might start trading that more. MNQ actually had more volume today than the ES. But if I spend a little time and get used to how the MNQ and NQ move it should be alright. I just left my charts the same. So this is a MNQ chart with a few trades on it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I'm sorry to hear about your son, Pastor. This thread can wait for you to post when you are free. Started early today and lost 3 trades, then recovered a bit, now down $37.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
I have been in and out all week with appointments for my Son. So today I have just traded the MNQ. Small 5 point trades. So today 40 points so far. Which is not that big of a deal with the small tick size of the MNQ. I am just getting used to the MNQ. So only trading 2 Micro lots. But happy with the process so far.

This market is boring today. Time to go do something else.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hello kthrapp. First let me say Happy Easter and it's comforting seeing a pastor trade. I started to think God forbids trading because my trading journey has just been terrible and thought God was punishing me. Your style of trading really seems to fit my personality so I want to give it a shot. I hope you're still trading this way and see my message. I have a few questions when you have a few minutes: 1. Do you have the "Calculate" settings on the indicators set to "On price close"? I had it set to "On price change" and I found that a few times when the CCI line crossed 0, I would enter and then it would reverse immediately. Looking back it never crossed but it did in real time. If I had it "on candle close" it would have kept me out of the trade. 2. Is there an order of priority? Today at 9:32am EST, CCI crossed above the 0 line on the 1500 tick chart, but it was already well above the 0 line on the 610 and 233 tick chart. This seems to happen a lot. 3. I noticed that sometimes the Stoch-RSI is already way above .50 while CCI is still below the 0 line. So when CCI crosses the 0 line, is that fine to enter when the Stoch-RSI line is already pretty up above its line? Or do you only take the trades when they cross their lines at around the same time? 4. If I am currently in a trade, let's say I'm short when the CCI and Stoch-RSI cross it's lines. Then before my profit hits, the lines start to reverse and cross the other way, would you close that trade and open a long? Just curious how you generally handle these. Sorry for these long questions. I'm really intrigued by this style of trading and hoping I can get some clarification. I will look back at everything on my own as well and back test today's price action. God bless and thank you!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hey Marvin, I kind of slammed here, but I will answer all your question as soon as I can. It does take some practice, But I have my indicators set on each tick. So it does react just as you said some times. But I also have a tick counter on the chart. I wait for the bar to close. Both ways, Set for the close of a bar or each tick work great. It is just your personal choice. 2) you notice that on the 1500 tick chart the CCI is set at 10 periods. You could also use 14 periods. And on the 610 it is either 14 or 20 periods. Lately I have been most of my entries on the 610. 3) The Sto-rsi is all about momentum So if you see it above the 50 but the CCI is below do not take that trade. So if CCI crosses above lets say, but the Sto-rsi is below 50 then I would not take that trade. Probably would be a loser. 4) I would have to see some charts with your entries and exits here. Let me know how you are doing. thanks for the post.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thanks for your response. I had an incredibly difficult day today but before I talk about that, please take a look at the attachment of my 610 tick chart. This happened a few times a couple days ago, and this happened repeatedly today which is why I kept losing. In this picture, I went long here at this cross (this is from April 1, at around 12:57am...I didn't actually take this trade but had a similar one I am having trouble finding at the moment). It only reached .75 points and then the CCI started to cross back down through the 0. So I got confused and reversed my position. Yes if I held, it would've ultimately been a win, but when you see 1 cross one way, and another cross the other way before your profit is hit, do you just ignore the second cross if you're already in a position? And if it hits your stop loss then so be it? In my second attachment with the gray highlighted area, I had extreme difficulty here. I got really chopped up. Do you have any type of indicator or anything that helps you stay out of this? Chop has been the #1 reason I have been unsuccessful in trading since I began 2 years ago.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I am quick new to trading and have been doing well with order blocks. I have a quick question. How do you know if price is going to respect your demand or supply zone if there are more than one demand or supply on the chart

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hey everyone. Blessings. So I have been slammed all week and have not even traded at all. Sad I would have liked to trade today. But really I study the P/A for the chop. Most indicators that say it measures that are really slow. So Stopped trying to use them. I use the BB's mostly. When they are close together and the Moving average is just going pretty much straight across the screen. Old school I know. As far as support and resistance or Supply and Demand. Those are area's or zones not an exact number. You have to wait and see if price rejects that area or breaks through. I use the higher 1500 tick chart, When the BB's are going parallel to each other you are in chop. You could use Keltner Band or something simular and get the same results.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I'm hoping you come back and post updates on how your trades are going with screenshots of your charts as you did in the beginning.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I will. Going to do a replay of Friday. Since I was gone all week, feel a little out of touch. So I will post the charts. How long have you been trading and who is your broker?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
The yellow Ema's are 12 periods set at high, 12 periods set at low and then a 12 period (blue) in the middle. Price has to close above or below the band to go long or short. The Macd has cross in the same direction. I use the CCI and Sto-rsi also. Both have to be above or below the zero line or the .5 line. The opposite band is your stop. Pretty simple. saw this the other day. Similar to my usual stuff so made it a part of my charts. I like it. Simple. But Friday was simple. Had plenty of room to trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) there is a gentle man that has a thread on here Rockypoint who trades similar also. He use bands of 8Eme;s and the Macd with Renko charts and does quite well. Check out his thread. You might like it. And Vidvad had a thread the is similar. Good trader. Check out his thread also. similar strategy.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Really appreciate you doing this. I've been trading for 2 years but 1 year on futures. By far my 3 biggest problems have been 1. Oversizing And 2. When a trade goes my way, I expect it to go to a certain area to take profit but it reverses. 3. I tend to get in a trade too late. Every time I try to pick a bottom like a lot of people do, it continues going againt me. So I have figured taking small profits like you're doing with your strategy would work best for me. As for your strategy, I have done just OK to be honest. When I did this on day 1, every trade worked for 5 ticks. The next day, multiple trades seem to get 4 ticks and then reverses and stops me out. My main issues have been that I try to take a position on every cross (this actually worked on the first day and that maybe just set bad expectations for me when there is a small trend). Sometimes I get in, and the CCI line goes right back below 0. Looking on your chart above, the following is what I would have done and I would have taken losses: - short at 8:35 when the green line crossed below the 0 (you actually went long a couple minutes later....is that because CCI was already above the 0 and you saw the Stoch-RSI cross upwards?) - short at 8:46 - long before 9:01 It looks like you stayed out of shorts before 9 because of the trend correct? I struggle with this because every time I think there is an actual trend, the market just goes back and forth. Whenever I don't think there will be an actual trend, I miss it all lol

--- 帖子 #447 ---
dear pastor, thank you for the thread! exactly what i was looking for. i love the ES. good price action, great movements and low fees. perfect for quick in and quick out. also if you have only 1 or 2 hours per day for trading, still plenty of opportunities. i tried stocks and forex for years but failed cause for me still the usd/eur 1 min chart is too slow. and too much spread and comission. so glad i fell over your thread. ****** now i only have one question, can anybody help? i opend a ninjatrader 8 demo with 50k "demo-money" margin. i have around $4 fees return. today i had only positiv trades. i made $160 win with them but my cash balance shows only a total profit of $17. seems that ninjatrader is taking even more fees? is it for margin? i want to open a real account with $2'000 for trading. for each trade i take around 3 ticks profit ($37). wich fees for each trade do i have to pay? only these $4? or more? ( if i trade on the standart account without monthly fees) thank you so much for helping here :-) cheers.*******

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Ninja trader posts all the fees that will charged for each trade on there website. I pay under 5 dollars per round trip. Meaning that includes entering and then exiting the trade. You can get a data feed for the account for as low as 16 dollars that is all you need really. That is charged to a credit card once a month. So if you get a daily statement which you would when you trade live it would break down all the fees for each trade.

Was finally home today where could sit at my desk and trade. I traded the MES today with 3 contracts per trade. I have not been around much lately to trade so I am a little rusty. This I traded small today. This is my chart of some of my trades. I trade a lot small trades just getting 4-8 ticks per trade. So I trade a lot. 41 trades today. after the commissions a made about 310.00 dollars. Not a lot but at least I was in the green. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is the Anchor chart I have been trading lately. it is 1200 tick chart of the ES. RSI set at 14/34. I have been doing most of my entries on this chart. some time as the markets change how they trade you have make minor changes to your charts. a few years ago the markets were more active. But since then have slowed down. So I slowed down my charts a little. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This my faster chart. it is a 400 tick chart. I never trade when these two do not agree with each other. It is the same chart setup as he 1200 just a faster time frame. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi kthrapp thanks for sharing your system looks great do you think i could use the same setting in the spx500 on tick chart.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Yes you can.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Thats great. do you still use this system and thanks again for sharing happy holidays.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!! Yes I do. I have slowed down my tick charts a little now as the market has changes. Have to do things like that some times. Markets are always evolving. But the principle is still the same. The one thing I now that is not covered in the posts is I always wait for a second move if the market might be changing direction. SO that means that if the long term chart starts to reverse, the short term chart has already reversed. So I will wait for the short term to pull back and then continue in the new direction. I do not take a trade if it doesn't pull back. Keeps me out of chop and my percentage of wins went up. I always trade indicator within the market structure. Makes the signal more accurate. Keeps me on the right side of the market. Hope that helps. I have been trading the MNQ and NQ a lot lately. So my long term chart is 1000-1200 ticks and my short term chart is 400 ticks. So If I can I will post a couple of my newer charts. Blessings

Dear sir, I am new to this thread. Everything you explained is clear except one basic thing: what timeframe or renko block do your ticks refer to? I use Mt4 and the tick for me is the minimum difference between one price and another, but the charts on Mt4 are based on timeframes or renko bars. Thank you for your answer.

It is the last day of the year and the Quarter as well. Price action is kind reflecting that. Funds are making the usual end of the Quarter adjustments and of coarse half of the traders are off until next week. Should be interesting for sure. Have fun and trade safe

These are my charts that I traded today. All the setting are on the charts. Very simple set ups. two time frames a 1200 tick chart and a 300 tick chart. The setting are pretty much the same for the indicators on both charts. But today was unusual as I was 16/16 trading the MNQ. Very rarely do not have any losers in a day. Usually around 75% winners to losers. But everyone have a great night. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

My Charts are very simple, Back in the day when I was more investing and not trading. I used Point and Figure charts. They are very simple to understand yet effective. So becoming a trader I had to unlearn a lot of that. But my charts are still very simple. On any of these indicators, Macd, CCI, RSI, williams%R. the Zero line or the 50 line is for either long or short. I like all of these and as you can see if you read through the thread I have interchanged them from time to time. I like the Macd a lot. So for me when the Macd line is above zero then I am looking long, Below I am look to short. If the Macd line is above zero and the Macd line crosses the average line but is still above zero. I do not sell. That could just be a break in upward momentum. but if it crosses the average back in the ward direction then I would get back into the trend. I really follow that on the smaller time frame. It is pretty simple. Works on all time frames, Time charts, tick charts, Range charts. What ever you like. this same principle applies to all the indicators. I hope this makes sense. Just takes a little practice to get into the rhythm of it. Again the Support and resistance levels are important, Trade management is important, So basic market structure is important and then trade the indicators with in that. So if the ES or NQ go into consolidation for a while through out the day. Which they do, the range is really to small to trade effectively. So you have to wait for a breakout. when I see a possible breakout. I never trade the first move. It could be a fake out. so I wait for a pull back on the smaller time frame and if that resume the uptrend let's say then I would enter on the second signal. Most of time I exit on the Macd when the Macd crosses back over the Average line. that usually means the trend is taking a break. That is pretty much my whole strategy in a nutshell. Simple. I take more small bites and every now and then sometimes get a bigger trade. But mostly singles as they say. I do not post a lot of content as I am pretty busy. But honestly this does work. I have a lot of charts in here. When the market really changes. I do not really change the indicators much. But I do change the time frame, Either bigger tick charts or faster tick charts depending on what I see. Hope this little bit helps. Everyone have a very blessed evening!!

This is what I have been trading lately. 2000 tick chart and a 500 tick chart. All the indicator settings are on the charts. I have been slowing my charts down more and more lately. I used to trade the 610 and 233 more, but they are just to choppy and noisy. So when that happens I just slow down the charts. So pretty much any thing you read in the thread prior to this will work on these charts. It is not rock science. Do not over think it. I do that a lot. I have said before I do not change my system much when the market changes. But I do speed up or slow down the charts depending on volatility. Hope you all had a great day trading.

Totally agree with your comments as to blindly following indicator signals. The trick is probalby more about knowing when to stay out of the market, when your signals are less reliable due to consolidation/ranging. Price action is the king and what you need to get a handle on in your trading. I trade a system very much like what you have described here and what I have settled on. One strategy one market has been my ethos for the last 6 months. I trade the hang seng index. Not where I want to be yet, but with a daily routine established find I can assess a chart and its prie action fairly accurately. Still a ways to go for consistency or to make a living out of this. Good to read other's commnets and thoughts, as we all seem to share the same struggles,frustration's that come with playing the trading game.

How are you handling slippage? Given that you're using tick charts with short TPs, with the aim of smaller number of pips, does slippage have an impact on you? Also, if you don't mind me asking: are you trading this with a real account? and if so -- how many lots on average per trade? (curious on your fill rate, etc)

So Slippage is not a big deal. I pretty much use Market orders when I enter. I do not trade any currency pairs. So we do not trade in pips. I do not use any unregulated brokers. That is recipe for disaster. I have been doing this since 97. I trade what ever I want between 1 and 10 contracts. That is really not important. If people like the charts, then give them a try in simulation first to get a feel for them. Have a great day.
