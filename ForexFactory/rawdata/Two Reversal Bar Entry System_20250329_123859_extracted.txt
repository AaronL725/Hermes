The origins of Two Reversal Bar Entry System are found in a thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=172963 started by http://www.forexfactory.com/tony_dtrader which appears to have been abandoned for a little over a year. The strategy is very simple and it is a good idea to read the original thread. It is a very short thread. Basically: Bull candle closes, new candle moves 5 pips up enter long. Bear candle closes, new candle moves 5 pips down enter short. We open 2 positions. For long trade: stop loss is below low of 1st candle in the set up. 1st take profit is 20 pips. When that is reached the stop loss for the second position moves to just above breakeven and is moved up as trade progresses. different ways to move the stop loss. One way is to move up under the swing lows on a lower time frame as they develop. Or a fixed trailing stop. Exit can be when there is cross of macd, or the 20sma turns down. Just the opposite for short trade. To make things as easy as possible there is an indicator: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...02009%202:08pm coded by http://www.forexfactory.com/fxxx which signals entries (and can be set to determine fixed exits and targets). I also consult macd (21,100,9), 200ema, cci55 and 14, tick charts for better pricing, wood pivots and s/r, market times and keep my eyes open for other signs of what might be going on in the market. Most signals are good. Some are obviously not good to take. The zip has it all. I am looking for two candle setups on the 4hr and following the market on the 15 min. Day candles and 4hr candles form differently according to broker gmt. I am using fxdd, daylight savings +2 gmt.

I like to use heiken ashi on the lower time frame... So there are market times shown with gray and dark gray backgrounds The higher time frame candles in dark red and dark green backgrounds (in this case the 4hr candles) heiken ashi on lower rime frame (here it is 15 min) macd (21,100, 9) to look for crosses, divergences and general trend and a 20 sma (color indi). We are waiting for a signal. Frankfurt about to open in 10 minutes.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
There's a signal just before Frankfurt open. We have entered long 2 positions. Stop has been placed just below Wood daily pivot, strong area of support and 1st take profit is 20 pips above entry. This is demo....

--- 帖子 #4 ---
First take profit reached. Stop for second position as been moved to breakeven. the 2nd position was opened a little late so I have not added the spread to it since it is already a very tight stop. If the remaining position goes 22 pips I will put the stop at breakeven +spread. So right now we would have nothing to lose and have locked in at least 18 pips.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This what it looks like with candles.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Jiva, are you only trading eu with this method?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
For now. I want to get this strategy right... then we can look at other pairs. Too much going at once to follow other pairs until I get the strategy down.. It should work just fine for other pairs. Especially trendy ones...

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Still in the trade with the second position. moved stop to break even +spread.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Moved stop to just under the close of the last 15 min candle. (I'm starting feel like a real trader).

--- 帖子 #10 ---
thanks, i am still testing it on 1hr using stoch's as additional confirmation. just had a good entry on eu on last candle, 20 pip tp hit. I am moving stop to be at +10.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
can expect some resistance at yesterday's r3 which was not quite reached yesterday... London about to open 2 minutes...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
seems to work better on eu than gu. also testing on usd/jpy after reading the original thread. will keep you posted

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Alright. Welcome friend... There are really good prospects for this...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
moved stop to just under low of present candle. We want to see how to stay in the trade and still lock in gains. Temptation is to jump out when there shows a big move up. The greed and fear element entering into decision making. But the better strategy is to try to stay in the trade and look not at what I'm not getting but at what I have locked in and what is possible. There is nothing to lose with a free trade.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Since this looks like a strong move we will keep moving the stop to just under the heiken ashi candle lows.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Asia about to close 10 minutes... no doubt some profit taking causing a pull back. Maybe my stop is too high?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Let's see if the selling stops now that Asia has closed.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
38 fib retracement so far my stop is at 50 fib. looks like it will get taken out.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
small bounce off the 50 fib and we are still in the trade...

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Cable data in 4 minutes. If it is very good data they could start dumping dollars and bring EURUSD higher.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Cable data was very good and there's a doji sitting 2 pips above my stop....

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Well that was it. Stopped out.. +45.7 pips between the 2 positions. Now we wait for another signal..

--- 帖子 #24 ---
divergence in macd on the 15 min. would expect to see a signal short maybe after US data?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thinking this is where we go... Will wait for signal of course...

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Unfortunately I won't be able to follow the trade. Car has to go into the brake shop... No wi fi there. Want to take this strategy to micro account next week. Forget the car brakes.. They can wait till tomorrow. Am waiting for a signal...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
so far so good. 10 minutes till 4hr candle closes and it is going bearish. 5 minutes till candle closes and it's hovering doji slightly bearish. After all it is Friday after a humongous move yesterday. Maybe we flatline today...

--- 帖子 #28 ---
signal short stop just above previous 4h candle high 1st tp 20pips

--- 帖子 #29 ---
more US data due out

--- 帖子 #30 ---
5 mins to consumer sentiment US..

--- 帖子 #31 ---
glad this is still in demo stages... not looking too good... Not sure I would have actually taken this trade were it a live account..

--- 帖子 #32 ---
stopped out... That's it for today, for this week.... It's a good strategy, have to see how to do it nicely... There's a lot to be said for just plain old common sense. Without that no strategy can work.. Looks like the stop was a little too close. few pips. looking at fib, there was a 61 retrace... so many traders use fibs it is a good idea to check and see how stops and targets relate to the fibs. But really no trades should have been taken after London. Friday is a tough day.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Common sense. Really necessary. Managing the trade really makes the difference for gains. I'm thinking that for 2 positions opened they will do better with fixed targets. the first target is 20, 2nd is 50. In order to catch a really big move 3 positions would work. stops for all 3 placed under the low of the previous 4hour candle (or common sense if there is a strong area of support) the first target 20 pips, if the 20 pips is reached and first closes then stop for second and third placed at breakeven with target for 2nd at 50 pips, and the 3rd with no target, stop at break even to be moved to under clearly defined swing lows as they form on the 15 min. For now I want to focus on managing 2 open positions. 20pips and 50pips. When I get that down so I can do it blindfolded, I can add management for a 3rd position. Running the simulator in forward simulated trading the results are good. But the real test is in the live market and using common sense. 1 day close to 70 pips. (Actually more like 120 pips since the simulator doesn't open 2 trades, I just marked for my own reference where the trades would have been).

-400 and thats a real account,good lord jiva,why dont u take mini lots 1k i lost 30 this week on gold,

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Are you crazy? Never mind... Not a real account... not yet. Not until I get this where I want it... I have a feeling it won't be long... All the pieces are coming together. Then it'll be micro. Sorry about the gold... (I've locked in $800 in equities this month).

--- 帖子 #36 ---
why doesnt it say demo account on that thing then

--- 帖子 #37 ---
i dont think u can forecast where the price is gonna go with indis ,but if u want a ea builder,u can get a free one on vantage fx,when u open an account of 500 and over

As ever, beaver is a storehouse of resources...

--- 帖子 #40 ---
more simulated trading this is what we can look for with this system. These entries are GOOD... Then we manage the trade for maximum gain... Based on 3 positions opened at the signal.. stops below low of previous 4 hour candle 1st out at 20 pips 2nd two stops moved to just above break even 2nd position target 50 3rd no target stop remains at just above break even waiting to be movbed up under a clearly defined swing low. 2nd target 50 pips reached so we would be up 70 pips total at this point with a free trade in play. 3rd position closed when macd crossed down. + about 112 pips for 3rd position total for the day about 180 pips..

--- 帖子 #41 ---
lol

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I wouldn't trade on this short signal. #1. time , it's just after US close, volume is very light and spreads can be wide. #2. the trend is strongly up... It might catch 20 pips but it's not worth the risk

--- 帖子 #43 ---
it would have made the 20 pips but just barely.. the wood pivot is very strong s/r..

--- 帖子 #44 ---
would have waited for the long signal which came around US open. But the trade didn't move very nicely and it was approaching Lunch time NY so jumped out with 16 pips (3 positions). Am practicing with 3 positions but when it is micro time I will open 2.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
another signal short but I would not trade it #1. right after NY close, spreads are wide and trading is thin #2. uptrend seems still intact. #3. prices sitting on strong support wood pivot

--- 帖子 #46 ---
that's twice I would have avoided taking a trade and it was good for at least 20 pips. Maybe I can keep an eye open for the action during the pre and early Asia.. Maybe trades can be taken then. Just open 1 position and catch the 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Practice practice practice.... $$$$ $$$$ $$$$

--- 帖子 #48 ---
little puzzling why there is no signal long?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
the first 2 positions would be closed +20 and +50 the stop for the 3rd position is moved up under the clearly defined swing low.. and we are in London session...

--- 帖子 #50 ---
macd cross, and 3rd position would be closed. +20, +50, +50 = +120

--- 帖子 #51 ---
now the big question would be should I take a short here? perhaps open 1 position short...

--- 帖子 #52 ---
it would have been good. +20

--- 帖子 #53 ---
it would have been good for 3 positions. +20, +50 and stop for 3rd position moved to just above swinghigh. Heading into US open

--- 帖子 #54 ---
long signal appeared, close 3rd position +61 total for trade would have been +20, +50 +62 = +132 I chose to open only 1 position. Considering market time (London open) 3 positions was a better choice. Macd crossed high from 0 line also.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
6 out 6 signals were good...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Awesome job Jiva... I'll start demoing this system next monday

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I was wondering if anyone was following the developments. Great. Let us know how it goes. I've tried a lot of stuff, but this is the best yet. Of course live market is a lot different from forward simulated trading. But it sure looks good..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi Jiva thanks for sharing the system. my question is hows the results on a ranging market? thanks

--- 帖子 #59 ---
can i suggest bill williams indis,i love his methods,one of the reasons i downloaded mt4 in the first place,i read his books,bill is oen of those guys that actually make money out of their trading systems then give it out ,not like most,hes old now,but very successful,i read in his book he created an ea on his alligator system,works great http://forex-indicators.net/bill-wil...tor-oscillator

--- 帖子 #60 ---
i reckon it would be bloody good to get the bill williams ao indicator(macd color one) and create it to an ea ,buy at green sell at red

Good question, we will know know soon enough. Obviously this is a strong strategy for trending markets. But these are the things to watch out for, market times, trending or not trending, etc. We shall see...

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I've studied his system a bit. Couldn't seem to put it all together in a way that I was comfortable with. Maybe I can get back to it after a while.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I agree. They can be a big distraction. Like too many people all talking at once. Noisy. Each has his own opinion and insists he is right and they hardly ever agree. Kind of like politics. Vote for me. I'll give you what you want. Make you a real winner. If you believe it you're already a loser. Take with a grain of salt, as they say... Oh but traders love their indis, with flashing lights and bells, sometimes I see charts with so many indicators I can't even see the prices action.. I like to consult macd 21,100,9, wood pivots, the 200ema and the 20 sma and sometimes obv and bb bands. More than that I know I'm losing it.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I've tried and tried to get the inverse ea trades consistently profitable and it is the weirdest thing how a couple of pips difference caused by the spread when the inverse trade is taken can make such a big difference. I can't seem to get even the worst ea to be profitable in inverse. Even at as high a rate as 70% loss with equal stop and limit. It's really bizarre.. But if you want to post the file for the loser I can give it a spin...

Only thing is little worrisome about security issues for installing. It is fantastic idea. But is still being developed. The log shows he is fixing bugs almost daily. The latest being a "dangerous security issue". Maybe to keep watching it's development...

--- 帖子 #76 ---
On second thought. If we get a signal short I'll take it. 1 position to open for 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
signal short took trade in micro looking for 20 pips time to go make some popcorn...

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I hope the trade goes better than the popcorn. The popcorn went all over the place..

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Maybe it's good trade maybe not. I closed for no loss. macd is testing 0 line. We can wait for Europe open and look for another signal.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
indeed it does look too good,in my mt4 the awesome oscillator goes broke in a year,in their one it just goes up,but its hard to make ea's with them,looks easy but its complicated as hell.nd the ea settings keeps adjusting,

--- 帖子 #81 ---
and the fxcm ea''s all go broke ,in eurusd,no wonder they want us to use them,bastards so they can take the other side,i dont trust them,not even fxcm,in 2009 they had a lawsuit againts them on cheating by changing the price and lying in the commercials all ove the web

--- 帖子 #84 ---
the short was good +20 and +50 and still going.. there are very few bad entries with this strategy. There are bad entry signals, but very few...

--- 帖子 #85 ---
It is reasonable to expect to see a possible 2 or 3 signals per day. One for each of the main markets... As confidence builds that the signals are good I'll be able to stay in the trade and not get jitters to jump out if there is some volatility. Like this morning. More simulated trading. Build confidence.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
maybe the ao ea is bad,because the bill williams system is not suppoed to be following one indi,it has two follow 2 or 3,main ones are gator oscillator and awesome oscillator,i always knew that they were great,because he got rich of it,and hes book is mostly about science,he compares it to trading ,smart guy,if u ask me hes abit like us,not one of those with one cube closed in brain,i mean how can all these noobs will bill ,hes got the best indis

--- 帖子 #87 ---

Confidence. That's what I need to make my strategy successful. Confidence in the strategy. amazing how significant that is to be successful. so more practice. to gain confidence. Today I missed anice trade because I exited too early, fearful that the trade might not be good. Missing confidence. So tomorrow we try again. the simulator shows what this strategy can do. If I will let it do it.... Confidence is the missing ingredient. Who who have thought it would such an important piece of the puzzle?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
when ur a loosign trader,confidence is all u need to loose even more,hehe,lol but for guys that have it in them,confidence is the key to success

--- 帖子 #92 ---
The turning point is when the confidence is in the strategy not in oneself. That's how the emotional swings are avoided. Now I lost now I won. It is confidence in the strategy. And the confidence will be well placed if indeed the strategy is good. I felt my fear this morning not of losing per se, I mean really it was micro with $4 at risk... Hardly enough to panic over. But the fear was that the strategy would prove wrong on the first live attempt and then my confidence in "it" would be shaken and I would be tempted to abandon it and then have to go through the whole thing of rummaging through piles of whatever to find something else that looks like it might work. When I want it to be this one. So that was why I didn't want to take a chance that it might be bad trade on a day when there is US holiday and no data. But now my confidence in the strategy is even stronger, that even on a dumb day like today it was a good signal. But nagging in the back of my mind I still feel like it will win win win in demo and simulator and as soon as I trade live it will bomb. I don't want it to bomb!!! Not on the first trade live............................ Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!

hi jiva sorry for my english but I'm not native speaker. please, could you explain better your ts set up? are you looking for 5 pip up or down from a 4H candle or 15 minutes candle? thanks in advanced for your answer

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi dragan, The DailyFX Forum has a list of free EA's based on common indicators included in the MT4 platform. But as with any indicator, you have to backtest and expirment with the settings to find an optimal strategy that you're comfortable with. The MT4 platform comes pre-installed with a sample moving average and MACD EA, but in the same spirit, you shouldn't expect either to be the holy grail to trading since they are simply examples upon which you can test and explore basic automated trading. In addition to the list you mentioned, there are more basic EA strategies for the Strategy Trader platform which you can test and experiment with http://forexforums.dailyfx.com/free-trading-strategies/ -Jason

Si parla inglese meglio di me italiano, ne sono sicuro. I cheat quando ho bisogno di tradurre con Google http://translate.google.com/#it|en| The signals are generated on the 4hr chart. Little tricky because 4 hr candles form differently according to broker gmt. I am using fxxd +2 gmt. The candles form at really good times in terms of market times. The 5 pips is from the opening of the second candle in reversal direction on the 4hr. The indicator will automatically calculate this and print the arrows. I manage the trade on the 15 minute chart.

[/quote] Yes, the lines above and below can be set in the indicator settings. They are to show desired stop and limit. I do not use them. So I set them to zero and make the color "none". The arrows show the point at which 5 pips has been reached. So the arrows mark the entry point.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
The 200 ema is such a powerful support/resistance area. Prices are drawn to it like iron filings to a magnet.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
The 4hr signals are very strong. But they do not occur all that often. It may be that the signal is missed or a trade is completed but the move is still in tact. So then how to get back in? On a pull back of course. But how do we find the pullbacks with some level of certainty? Here I have added another setting for the indicator. the 60 min setting shown in dark blue arrows. I would not take an initial entry position based on the 1 hr since it has many more false signals. The 4 hour is for that. But when the 60 min setting is used to find a pullback in an established trend it is very useful. Like in the chart. So I will be looking at this over the next little while. 3 of the 4 one hour reentry signals coincide perfectly with market openings...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
What generates the dark blue arrows? Do we change settings on 2rev bar indicator? Thanks Paul

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi Paul, To generate the dark blue arrows I simply add another set up of the indi. So there are 2 settings of the same indi on the template. Change the colors in the set up for the indi. One set at 240 for the light blue 4hr arrows and 1 set at 60 for dark blue 1 hr arrows. But I would only use the dark blue or dark red arrows to enter in an already well established trend. The 4hr arrows are the primary entry signals.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
There's a signal to go short but I'm not going to trade it. Spreads are a bit wide and most of the markets have not opened yet... I would look for a signal around Tokyo open shows as the light gray rectangle on the chart.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
entered short few minutes after Tokyo open just 1 position micro.. First live trade. looking for 20 pips Now time to do something else. Watched pot never boils as they say.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
it's good.. got it.. just barely.... +20 pips first live trade.. there's a signal from the 60 min candles but I am not inclined to take it when the signal appears as an initial trend change. although signals like that could be really good early entries. Will keep watching to see how that works. We wait for the next 4hr signal as it gets closer to Europe open marked by the next gray rectangle...

--- 帖子 #105 ---
about an hour before Europe open (Frankfurt) 4hr candle needs 5 pips long to signal long entry... macd testing 0 line for cross into bullish territory a dark red arrow from the 1 hr candle reversal setting has formed but I would not trade it. prices are resting on the wood pivot...

--- 帖子 #106 ---
we have our 4hr long signal just before Europe opens. placed one long in the micro for 20 pips and place 3 positions for the full strategy in a demo. 20 pips is reached, we move stops for all remaining open positions to just above break even The initial stop for all open positions is placed just below the low of the first 4hr candle in the reversal pattern. Here it is a pretty big stop loss. Tokyo, Sydney are still open and Frankfurt is about to open. So possibility for more trading volume.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
got it +20 move stops to break even plus spread.. nothing to lose now. 2nd target set for 50 pips 3rd will try to trail for 50 + London open is 1 hour. A person could become very wealthy doing this... I don't want to think about it too much, you know, the greed factor.....

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Well, there's something about trading with strategy tester and it's always a lot easier for me, with it set to about 27 and heat waves rizing off the computer your chart turns to a mirrage, but still the thing keeps going, up and down and up and down one pip then one pip again. Never seen price movement like that. It may be a way to overcome nervous trader syndrome which I have in spades. The one pip up and down thing is bad enough but reality considerably worse and blew about $10 in my $100 demo yesterday. Today got the entrance right on break above descending trendline on 15M chart. luckilly, but what I'm thinking is, without some other means of predicting at least a price direction, which is something jiva seems to have, these entrances alone may not make a complete system. Still stick to what I said in Tony's thread - as systems go in forex factory, and one must assume everywhere else, it's unusually good - You could say: could be used by beginning trader who knows nothing about price movement. The temptation is to - and what I did is - took 2RevBarsEntry_arr0Bar_mtf and set it for Trigger: 5, SL/TP 20. then went back to Dec. 20 counting trades (where I ran out of steam, though addmittedly a dumb season to use as example.) The result is: Hourly: Total 93 trades, 26 of which were bad. That is if you took the trades shown and let them run to TP or SL never touching it again, not taking into account that the indicator repaints when the bar changes color and erases the bad entrance. (It would be nice if it could be made so it didn't repaint.) With four-hour went back considerably farther but w/ fewer trades. Found it improved the general look of things if instead of 10-pip trigger &amp; 50 SL/TP, reduced it to 8-pip trigger and 45 SL/TP. This resulted in exactly two wins for ea. looser. which if I know forex trading systems, as a basic beginning of a system is at least pretty good. As a means of getting the direction right - which is where I always loose, there, and re-engineering it after entering - Do they have shrinks for nervous traders? I'll bet. - am now into "TVI_2color Crossover". (My thesis.):: The 2color (Tick Volume Indicator) repaints but not as much as Hull which will not deign to be placed in a separte window. By setting one TVI at 12, 12, 5 and the other at 25, 25, 5, you get a crossover that is pretty reliable, and believe it will be possible to get to know the indicator(s) behavior when the price reverses. 15M Chart must be set at second-biggest for the way I'm using it now. Best to two candle traders, hope this thread continues. B.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
if there is a pull back and we develop a clearly defined swing low I will move the stop for the second position to just under the swing low and leave the stop for the 3rd position where it is, just above break even.

Thank you. Yes the arrows for the 1 hour signals tend to disappear, repaint when the conditions for the signal change. Disappointing. But if you consider any indicator is simply identifying possible trade conditions. So paint or repaint in that sense doesn't really matter. If a possible trade condition has been identified by an indicator then other factors will need to be considered to see if it is indeed a trade opportunity. But I do not find the repainting to be the case with 4hr. they are stronger signals evidently. If I were to use the 1 hour signal it would be as a reentry signals only in a clearly defined trend, although I have not experimented with that as of yet. Another possible use for the 1hr would be to scalp the 5m movements, looking for 5 or 10 pips per trade. the fluctuations are enough to drive anyone mad. The dreaded nervous disorder I call "The cat and the fish bowl". Heiken ashi candles helps a lot to filter out the erratic movements. One of the reasons I like to use them so much, the other being their trend indication. I consult the candles quite often but do not use them alone. The significance of trading in conjunction with market times cannot be overestimated. It is what gives credibility to technical signals. Good luck and look forward to hearing of your experiences.

heiken ashi are just averaging it down,the previous candles with the nowz,

--- 帖子 #112 ---
closed position #2 at r1. I expect a bit of a pullback here, usually some resistance at r1. if we get a swing low will move stop for remaining position to just under the swing low and try to catch more pips... A close for 3rd position would be stop out or exit at cross of macd.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
yeah, smooths things... not such a bumpy ride...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
here is where I would watch the 15 min candle chart. To look for a pullback... swing low

--- 帖子 #115 ---
so far 38 fib retrace but not a strong swing low formation... at London open. 50 fib retrace would be nice our present stop could tolerate even a 61 retrace.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
nice move above previous hi and through r1 right about when Tokyo is closing. move stop to just under the swing low, not a true swing low but close enough. either stop out or macd cross for exit

--- 帖子 #117 ---
would expect some more resistance here also. yesterday's wood pivot point.. candle view chart 2

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Tokyo closed and the buying started in again. Probably some profit taking heading into the Tokyo close.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
This is really hard. To stay in the trade and not take 90+ pips. But that is the idea behind the 3rd position. to stay in as long as possible. It is a free trade, nothing to lose. macd is still looking strong... no sign of cross over heiken ashi candles showing long upper wicks, and r2 is just ahead... prices usually will go to the r or s levels they are closest to. the strategy is macd cross or stop out. but 90 pips!!! so this self control.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
that was it, I closed out I saw the spike on the 15 min and thought either we are going to go through another pullback or we are turning around. I was probably wrong about both since r2 is so close above. I will try to keep the discipline better next time. but for today nice gains +162. Maybe another signal at US open. Break time... http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...xgF7USt2TBzxzg

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I am using the indicator on page 1 set it to 240 (4hr i presume) when the first arrow appears on the chart do i place a order 5 pips abpove or below the signal candle when it closes or 5 pips as soon as arrow appears above or below current candle

--- 帖子 #122 ---
the order is placed as soon as the 4hr (240) arrow appears. The arrow itself is designed to appear 5 pips above the open of the 2nd 4hr candle in the reversal pattern for a long signal. There are other things to consider before placing a trade. Market time being the most significant. proximity to the wood pivot/s/r and the 200 ema. Macd is helpful too. Good luck. Keep us posted.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
the exit appears to have been timely. German data was very very good. But it may have been a case of buy the rumor sell the news. I do not have any doubts that there are leaks before data is released to the masses. Which means we could get a trade signal around US open. I should be recuperated by then.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Jiva.. could you share your template with us? Looks interesting Thanks

--- 帖子 #125 ---
It's in the zip on the first page... You'll need the indis to go with it... It should all be in the zip...

--- 帖子 #126 ---
If I didn't close the 3rd position the stop would now be moved up under the current swing low and the trade would still be open with 52 pips locked in and a shot a move higher. it was closed for 82 pips. It's possible we will get one of those dark blue arrow 1hr entry signals about an hour before US open. I won't be at the trading desk if we get the signal. Back in 1/2 hour.. Whether to trade it or not will be the question.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Would you consider adding a sound alert?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Definitely. Know anyone who can do the popup and sound alert? I tried but well, I had to reload mt4 after my attempt.... It should have the true/false (use or not) option and tell which pair and which time frame.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Thanks Jiva... Happy pipping..

hey noobs can i tell ya a secret,ur are all gonna loose money!ehheheh trading is not easy,its a mind game one against the other ill give ya a tip,try reading threats on why the prices move,and who moves it for what reason,and mtm

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Most people simply lose their money trading. Sometimes ALL their money. Demo and micro.... Until you actually know what you are doing for sure....

--- 帖子 #132 ---
There it is the dark blue arrows for 1 hour signal. I hesitate seriously to enter long here. macd is very far above the zero line as well as being quite a distance above the 200ema. the chart is a 15 min with mcandles set to 60. r2 is hanging just above but still.... US market opening. US data in 1/2 hour. I don't know. Maybe I'll just wait to see how this plays out.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
would look for a short signal 4hr in 15 mins or so...

--- 帖子 #134 ---
ye we are saying that from experience,but in reality for us small time traders,experience is the only thing that makes us money,becuase we got slapped in the face so many times,that we memorized all the candlestick formation repeats,hehe lol abit sad,but its the only way

--- 帖子 #135 ---
short signal 1 short in micro full strategy in demo 3 short... US session always seems more difficult to trade to me than London or even Tokyo... Can't rely on indis like macd. Macd can cross and recross until your head spins. Divergences galore and still not reverse direction until it's good and ready, sometimes 100's of pips and a margin call away... maybe I got this wrong, a four hour signal appeared macd crossed and US session full swing, entered short, but maybe it's just a pullback and risk trade is on and Eur goes higher. r2 hanging over head saying come over here I have lots of orders waiting.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
nice train set there,i want to short as well ,but what looks like down,is actully stopping volume,as we see narrow spread bars,that means that the big guns are exchaning hands with the weak players,so no more demand from big shakers in ny,but i wouldnt complately say that supply has been remove,look at 15m,,now and short when it goes lower a bit, what we saw today/yesterday was a shakeout from big guns trading to fool us,so they can hit uor stop losses and profit,in return more liquidity for them so they can dump their crap on someone else what im talking about is the down move,when clearly we didnt see any narrow bars which means they are exchanging hands,now we are seeing narrow bars and upthrusts,but the bolume isnt particularly big, now im looking at 15,and its rising,from the fall,shows thath theres still supply present and they aint getting out,,when the supply starts beating demand,then we are ready for a turn

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Now that I'm in the trade, yecht.. sometimes I try to determine if there is alot of trading to support the move by looking at obv. maybe there's a chance of surviving this. obv is not supporting the push higher... strategy calls for stop above the high of the previous 4hr candle... It's that r2. Never underestimate the power of support and resistance.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
r2 http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...l3sGIouOnXvYmg

I may just avoid US market altogether. Just trade Tokyo and London. Us seems always weird to me.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
if the market falls after this,it means this was a mark up to shake the shorts of the market,if that happens im short,but if not,then nothing warren buffet words "if theres nothing to do do nothing"

--- 帖子 #142 ---
lol,tokyo,thats almost like a dead beat,

--- 帖子 #143 ---
my guess is that we are actually putting a top in here. There were orders at r2 waiting and now we head down to the wood pivot before US closes. Just a guess, but I've seen it before... Anyway I traded the strategy. I could have waited a bit before placing the order short since it was a little unclear long or short. 1 hour long signal and 4hr short signal at the same time. Demo and micro... this is why...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
just my speed...

--- 帖子 #145 ---
yeah to shake the short like me out.....

--- 帖子 #146 ---
i kind of guessed,i dont think its ur speed in reality,its that u didnt read mtm,becuase theres no other way than the vsa way

--- 帖子 #147 ---
yes to slower the pace of the fall,becuase they want it up,so they can sell it to someone there,for a profit

--- 帖子 #148 ---
check out the volume,theres always more buyers than sellers,in this up trend,when we see more seller coming in then down,might not be true volume,but its good enough to see where money is what does that mean? it means that banks and big traders move the markets,and try to fool us into exhcnaging their crap with us,the more of us are short,the more of them will be buy ,and short on the level of our stop loss,limit order if we cant see big movers volume,at least we can see the big fools volume,same thing actually,:nerd:

--- 帖子 #149 ---
post your chart so we can see what you say...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I was just watching the indicator on 15min time frame 4hr signal and on two charts the indicator was there and then disapeared does it repaint

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Is this the kind of thing you would look for??? a/d divergent...

--- 帖子 #152 ---
yes I like what Dragan is pointing out.. He is right. about the volume. Took a few quick scalps and back in with a short signal and the trading strategy. London closing. Not sure what that will mean for direction going forward. But that is probably related to the sudden drop.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Something I have been overlooking last few hours. Very significant. Proximity to the 200ema. Best trades are when prices leave the 200ema and either head up or down. That seems to be the case with Europe markets. By the time we get to US a big move has already been in place for several hours. and we are miles away from the 200 ema and bumping up against some support or resistance levels somewhere. That's why Europe is attractive to trade. US bounces around, up? down break support? break resistance? etc. all miles away from the 200 ema. The break out strategy will be most effective when prices are hovering around the 200 ema and ready to move. that's Europe markets. Also Tokyo is good for 20 pips here and there. Prices tend to hover around the 200 ema during Tokyo too. But during US mkt we are miles away from the 200. And should we retrace? Should we continue? And US is only really good for 3 hours to find a big move. Just thinking out loud. How to do this. What to do what not to do. etc. Not all strategies work the same in all market conditions.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
dont you think u got too many indicators there?

--- 帖子 #155 ---
feeling better about things. after the spill this morning...... we are back in and have reached first target. next stop 50 pips.... stops all moved to just beyond break even. And all the rambling about never trading US market and especially after lunch time New York. Well here we are in a trade.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
maybe we have head and shoulder top?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
3 out of 4 signals were good Other factors than just the arrows need to be considered. The s/r levels cannot be ignored. r2 was the problem for the one bad trade. I closed the last 3 shorts because of the time of day, afternoon NY. Tokyo next. I think Tokyo can be good fairly consistently for +20 pips per session using the 2 reversal bar entry.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi jiva I think it is a misunderstanding. I use the same strategy (Two Bar Reversal Entry System from Tony dtrader) ... The only difference is that I do not use the indicator of fxxx, but the candles (bullish bearish) look. I was quite determined not you interfere with the development or testing of the strategy. Please excuse me if I did something wrong here. Will delete all entries. best regards, Wandler.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
question was raised about how this system would perform in a sideways market. It may be there would not be signals. since it takes 2 4hr candles going in the same direction as each other but reverse direction from the 3rd before them, to generate a signal. If consolidation is going on it might not be that 2 candles will agree. Or if they do it would be obvious by looking at the chart that there is no trending. We shall see.

Could not be at the trading desk to manage the trade. Closed early. But it was a great signal and entry. would have taken the 20+ and the 50+ targets and would still be in the trade just about to exit the 3rd.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Looking at the weekly chart there is some resistance as prices bump up against the 200ema. Would expect to see some stalling and maybe a slide back a bit. Unless of course they just blast through it.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
No doubt going to r1... which corresponds to the 200 ema on the weekly... If I had stayed in and managed the positions would still be in the trade. Will wait for Europe open. Conditions can change on a dime... so to speak...

I noticed the indicator repaints is there away to stop this ie once signal given it stays on the chart to allow visual back testing [ quote=jiva34;4324982]No doubt going to r1... which corresponds to the 200 ema on the weekly... If I had stayed in and managed the positions would still be in the trade. Will wait for Europe open. Conditions can change on a dime... so to speak...[/quote]

--- 帖子 #168 ---
[/quote] The indicator is simply showing if prices move 5 pips one way or the other in relation to the opening of a new 4 hour candle. Since the candle is still being formed there is no way to guarantee which way the candle will form. So it is not exactly repainting. It is just that the 4 hour candle has not closed yet. That is why other considerations are so important. Market time, s and r, general trend etc. The arrows simply show that a trade condition may be forming. Like any other indicator the possibility is there. It is not a blind go ahead signal. If the arrows appear there is a very high probability of success.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Five minutes till a new 4hr candle and we are looking for a short signal. Sometimes I will check a/d and there is definite divergence there that favors short. a signal here and that could take us down the 20 to 50 pips into the US open. r1 has already been tested and rejected so yesterday's repeat of spike up to resistance is not likely. macd has crossed. The wood pivot and the 200ema are sitting together just below...both strong magnets. No new data until US data after US open. That's the reasoning however markets like to defy reasoning...... It is possible we could go back up to retest r1, not much transacting took place there on the first test.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
There's the signal. In 3 positions demo 1 position micro.. 1st tgt 20, 2nd 50 3 let it run... stop just above high of 1 4hr candle in the setup. We want to get to 20 pips asap. Since then we can move the remaining stop to just below break even and go do something else.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi Jiva, been following from the sidelines, 1st attepmt to tade it on demo today and i too caught that signal although i could have been a little late in and currently -14. Did you hit your 1st +20? Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thanks for your time and sincere efforts. Happy to hear you are sensible enough to only trade demo. Mostly traders are way too impatient and try to trade their hard earned money too soon before having a realistic grasp of the trading. Needless to say they only lose their money, sometimes ALL their money.... I am still learning the ins and outs myself. We had a similar situation yesterday. After a major move upwards towards resistance trading stalled out and there was a retest of the resistence. Similar situation today. It is all a matter of buyers and sellers. When there are more sellers it goes down, more buyers it goes up. What makes them buy or sell,? What they think is going to happen to value of the currencies, data, news, etc. We just finished a huge run up in the Asian markets. They are smaller markets than London and US. Some of those Asian buyers would want to lock in gains and sell off a bit before their markets close, So we saw a pullback. But now the sellers may be becoming few and far between and the larger London market buyers are taking over. Also US is about to open. More buyers since the general mood is risk is now okay, economic recovery is good. So I took the signal short, trying to consider as many things as I could but I did not consider like this before entering the trade. So if it is a bad trade I can learn from it. What to look for when there is a signal. We want to understand as much as possible about what is going on in the market place so that we can evaluate signal when it appears. The signals are not set in stone they simply point out there may be a trade opportunity. Traders want to just put it on automatic, but there are so many automatic trading programs out there and they are very dangerous. I have looked at so many and they all involve way too much risk and eventually destroy an account.. there is something to be said for trying to understand the underlying forces at work in the market. As least that is my opinion at present. Of course everything in forex changes, so maybe that will change too. But that is how I see things at present

--- 帖子 #173 ---
there's the resistance we are testing.. the 200ema on the day chart. likely to break through to the upside, unfortunately... we can think maybe we will get a pullback... if US housing data in 45 mins is exceptional (hmmm it's been a while since US housing data has been a rousing source of enthusiasm)I closed the micro for a loss. letting the demo play out. Most likely we will get a good signal long... This is the same scenario as yesterday. Only yesterday after the spike higher we had a big drop. The dangers of trying to trade against a strong trend.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Jiva, Good summary. Maybe there is some milage in only trading with the trend in the higher time frames, although then you could miss some good entries on the retracements! Ill keep it on demo for a while. Trade update: SL hit! I will keep you updated with my progress.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
same scenario as yesterday. signal appeared short against a strong trend. Then it disappeared the position stopped out and then the signal reappeared. So today it has also disappeared and stop is taken out, but whether it reappears or not is questionable. I do not have a problem with this appearing and disappearing. Because the indicator is only indicating that a possible trade set up may be taking place. It is up to me to decide if it worth taking or not. So please don't start posting and whining and fussing that it repaints. If you do, it only shows that you do not understand what this indicator is and what it is measuring...and you should read the thread first and it will be time to hit the ignore button...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
thank you.. It is a matter of fine tuning. We simply want to get in with a good entry and then manage the positions. If it were so easy then we would all be billionaires by now. But it can be done and we will do it...

Jiva, Can i ask how you are managing your trades once open? I have been using Steve Hopwood MPTM which allows you to set a BE at say + 20 and you can combine this with a partial close of your open position. let me know if you think it could be useful and ill post the link

--- 帖子 #180 ---

This should help.. the best entries, and well worth waiting for. are when prices are leaving consolidation around the pivot and 200 ema. There is a an aspect to trading that is addictive. A lot of excitement is generated when a position is in play. This releases adrenalin and the effect is heightened senses. So it is like a drug. The tendency is to want to feel this heightened sensual level all the time, it is pleasurable, so traders fall into the trap of over-trading. They must have their fix, to feel alive. Adrenalin rush addiction. This is not the secret to successful trading, this is a recipe for disaster! So we want to be able to identify the good entries and then wait for just the right set ups and make a lot of money. Boring but profitable. That's my goal.

Successful trading is like anything else that someone become successful at. Practice, practice, practice. Like an athlete, or musician, artist, marksman... whatever. It's like the Olympics. There are lot of skiers, but not everyone makes it to the Olympics. Some just get a broken leg.. yes, it is difficult. But if you consider what is possible with mastery of all that needs to be mastered.. An awful lot of money!!!!!! With a steady average of just 20 pips/day and good money management a person could be become a millionaire very quickly. The psychology needed to become successful is the secret factor. The metal the trader is made of. Anyway, I go on an on. I'm only in the forging fire myself. Steel would be nice, but I act more like aluminum (foil). So we keep at it. little bit little bit one day jackpot...

--- 帖子 #187 ---
2 days in a row fell into the same exact trap... we will wait for the breakout from consolidation around the pivot and 200 ema, place the 3 positions and be patient. No 3 times!!!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Plan of attack: Will be monitoring several pairs to see which ones are consolidating around the pivot and 200ema. Will check for entries around market openings. Tokyo open, Europe open, maybe skip US altogether.. That's it. Looking for breakout from consolidation on the 15 min with the 4hr 2 reversal candle set up. NZD cpi due out..

--- 帖子 #189 ---
gold is setting up for a move

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I think that sounds a sensible approach, the US session seems to give signals that are reversals of the move already started in the Europe / London session. Like you said earlier, moves away from areas of consolidation and the 200 ema seem to yeild the best pips

--- 帖子 #191 ---
EURJPY is also at the pivot... There ar a few other pairs similarly at the pivots and 200 ema. so plan is to check back when active trading starts in again around Tokyo open. Then check back again Frankfurt and European markets.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yes, I think so. Other wise it's like trying to get in on a pulloback and it's iffy if it is going to continue or not, or else trying to grab a few pips as it retraces. Seems like US markets are like that, somewhat played out already.... whereas the moves originate from Asia sometimes (like yesterday) or mostly from Europe. Tokyo is the smallest of the markets, US is middle size. London is the biggest market. It's not just news and data that gives a big push it's when the doors open and traders flood orders in. Be back just before Tokyo. Sayōnara

--- 帖子 #193 ---
may not be around for Tokyo, will be ready for Europe

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I am pleased to see that you develop the strategy in this direction. I'm the same way gone ... and only with MTF, MD, and news was the strategy right profitable. Wandler. PS.: The session trading EURUSD in EU and U.S. you would have been avoided with MTF.

Hello friend, Sorry about the misunderstanding. Happy to see you again. Together we can get to where we need to be..

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Okay this makes a lot of sense. Almost all the pairs are ready for a move. I may be a little late to the party though. Many of them resting in consolidation waiting for the action to begin starting with Asia. Not sure what brought on the big moves early before Asia opened unless anticipation for China data release (threatening tightening of monetary policy to strengthen the yuan) to be released in 1 and 1/2 hours. But big move in kiwi and Aussie. and many of the pairs. Lots of 4hr reversal signals. took 3 trades demo 3 positions each, micro on hold for now. Short EURUSD, long USDJPY, short EURGBP Maybe little late to the party. We need a sound alert... Could keep the machine on in the other room and if there is sound alert check it.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
yes mtf.. macd is my indi of choice. the indi I am attaching is macd with 2 different settings for same time frame (present chart time frame) macd default 12,26,9 and macd 21,100,9 This should help...Price action is main focus but reference to trend is necessary...

Short EURUSD, EURGBP ... Reentry? ... can you tell me the reason? USDCHF possible long trade looks good (but first, news). Thx.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
hedged EURGBP short was a mistake. just dumb prices sitting on support wood pivot.. have reverse position. Long.. trying to get it right. the short moves were there but I was late getting in. I notice you stay for 10 pips only. I was thinking to catch bigger moves. 20, 50 and beyond... Staying short EURUSD, think there is more to go down. Again late to the party...

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Long EURGBP Next trade London sassion. Looks good for EUR. Have fun, Wandler.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
OK, I understand. 10p. 20p. 30p. ... I use the TP according to how well the signal is (or rather, I think, how good it is). Maybe you interested this . You probably already know. But I would not say more, lest I disturb you in the development of the strategy. ... In addition: GBPJPY Short and wait for London open.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
You are part of the development of the strategy. I thought maybe you were just crazy. Apologies. Just communication problem. We see you are very serious trader and are probably successful at least to some degree. Yes it may be that my profit targets are unrealistic. But that was why I chose 20 pips as the trigger for closing a position and moving stops to break even. 20 pips is not so much to expect from a trigger on the 4 hour chart. Or so I was thinking. But I was considering only trading EURUSD small spread big swings. This may still be good for EURUSD. But maybe I could use your "10 pip grab and run" for other pairs. thank you for your input and humility. Could you explain a bit more in detail what you are doing since you are somewhat successful with the 10 pip profit trades? what candles you are using 60min? How you consult the mtf, and what you are using macd. rsi? Thanks.. if you don't mind to share with us... Your posting is respected. It was confusing that your charts had so many "railroad tracks" and yet you were saying you didn't use indicators. So we thought he is crazy. But we see now they are there for reference and as a side thought main focus is 2 candle reversal breakout. So hopefully the air is cleared on that and you will feel welcome on the thread. I think you have some things you can share that will help us. Ich denke, wir können einige Dinge von Ihnen lernen. That's what this is all about. Okay? friend?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Yes GBPJPY short.. I will look for the 20 pips first target strategy. But it does increase the risk on the trade. Since there are 3 positions that could stop out for a loss. Whereas a winning trade might only be 1 position for 20 pips and 2 positions closing at break even. Will have to way and measure if it is actually worth it try for a 3 position trade with this strategy or where and when it is worth it to place the 3 positions as opposed to maybe looking for 10 pips only. Can you tell us little more detail what you look for in a trade?

re: this Yes. this is being done on a very big scale. Quantitative analysis. Just reading the post at this link has changed my outlook considerably.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
For now we will stay with the original plan. Look for entries at significant market times, market opens specifically Tokyo and Europe 3 positions look for +20, +50 and beyond... 240 2 reversal candle signal and manage the trade on the 15 minute.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
1 hour before Frankfurt long signal EURUSD consolidation area.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
It may be that the targets are too high. The signal (no longer visible) was good for 15 pips. So the 20 was not reached and now there is a sell off. It was Frankfurt open with good German data, but Tokyo is still open. It may be more practical to look for gain with a larger position and 10 pips than 3 small positions and not reach the targets. Still consolidation. Frankfurt was not enough to actually break out. London will still be the decider.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
still in the trade watching volumes. fascinating. How to see when the buyers are done and then the prices falls and when the sellers are done the price goes up..

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Want to watch near Tokyo closing, if there has been a run during the session looks like we can expect profit taking just before the Tokyo market closes.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
first tgt reached +20 stops moved to just above break even 2nd tgt 50 3rd closes with macd cross of stopped out That's the toughest part. Getting to that first target. After that no risk and 2 positions to run....

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Yes, my English is not as good. I use Google translation. If you do not understand what, say modest I try to describe it differently. Normal, I am a silent observer, but it has just got to see that anyone had the same strategy useless ... I wanted to join in a bit. Yes, I am doing ... later (currently no time). Wandler.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hey Jiva, I'm bit late to the party today! Can i ask, where did you set your SL when you initially entered the trade? I think i would have been stopped out on the spike that went below the 200 ma

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Very nice EU session. GBPUSD, EURUSD, EURJPY ... Long Close with any TP 20p. USDCHF ... Short Close with TP 20p. NZDUSD, AUDUSD .... Long (but with sm. TP 10p.).

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I moved it a bit lower than the low of the first 4 hr candle in the set up. I'm watching out for profit taking spikes around Tokyo close.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I experimented with other pairs taking small profit tgt, 10pips but not good results. We wait for some details how you do it. time frame, what candles 1 hour?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
hi，jiva34，can you tell me what are the rules in trading with your system？？

--- 帖子 #220 ---
away from trading desk for a while. closed all EURUSD. around 90 pips total. This what is possible with this system. I want to be able to do this regularly and with no stress... I am certain that understanding what is happening in the market place in terms of mkt openings and closings will make the difference. Among other things of course.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi Jiva, here for example only H4 and H1. You can see, it is not indicator ... simple bars from another TF.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yes I see. Can you post the mq4? Maybe we want to try this...

--- 帖子 #224 ---
It is on the first page... If you read that and do not understand send me a pm..

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Maybe sideways mkt for a while now until US data, 2 hours...

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Someone asked why I used the 200ema and liked it so much. I said I didn't know why it was so amazing but it was. Just look at the perfect pirouette.....

--- 帖子 #227 ---
This is exactly what we would look for. I am focused on EURUSD but if I can become a little more familiar with other pairs like USDJPY then I can take some trades there too. Flying out of consolidation.....

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Same with GBPJPY

--- 帖子 #229 ---
This short may have a little more to go but I would not take the trade. We want to find the trades where the train is leaving the station.. The move down has been underway for quite some time. prices are below s2 headed for s3. So there may be some more to it. By too much risk there of stalling out and reversing..

--- 帖子 #230 ---
There's the signal to go short and the leaving of the consolidation area that we want to catch. Most likely this is the low for the day now. prices are resting on s3. If they go much lower they usually return to s3 before US markets close. Sometimes then can just keep going, but very rarely... It doesn't mean they are going to fly back up, they can just sit there for a very long time and then drift lower tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Good news for CAD and USD ... easy pips .

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Sure ... here .

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Jiva, do you use MD analysis? for example last trade: EURUSD down EURJPY up -------------------- USDJPY is therefore very interesting. see whether a signal is present ... yes, long ... OK, long USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
an example of more (look now): EURUSD down EURGBP up -------------------- GBPUSD is therefore very interesting. see whether a signal is present ... yes, short ... OK, short GBPUSD. Such signal I rename all good signals. You asked me for TP ... with such signals is my min TP 20 pips (but usually I close the trade manually).

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I see the logic. And have seen some posts and even some indicators that measure the strength of the pairs. Makes good sense. Traders who use baskets of currencies like to analyze like this. I will be considering like this. Thankyou..

--- 帖子 #236 ---
A day like today is very exciting. But it can be extremely dangerous too. So we want to take good trades on days like this. But must be very careful also., Whipsaws can and do happen in an instance. We will see how get in on some of these big moves but only if we are safe. They happen so quickly and so many things can go wrong. The broker can not keep up with the orders and there are requotes and missed orders. The mt4 can jam up leaving us helpless to manage the trade. The whipsaws, 50 pips in a heartbeat in the wrong direction. A person could become rich in a matter of minutes. Or they could find themselves living in the street. Pending orders with defined stops and limits may be one way to go. If there is a signal and news about to break have the pending order in place. Many traders simply do not even try to trade the news.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
i am one of them! On the sidelines today on my live account, trying to keep up on demo! Im just going to concentrate on EU for now until i am more confident with the entries

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Takes your breath away, doesn't !!! It can take your life saving's away too..... We want in on the action but we want to do it in such a way as to still have funds to trade tomorrow!!! I'm done for today. Next stop Asian open.. Maybe I will check in 2 hours earlier than Tokyo, since the moves out of Asia have been gigantic last few days and they have started early.... I have lots I can research and practice even if not actually trading...

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I think everyone should do what he thinks is best But the fact is the news and economic situation make the price. For example: Now we get a signal for ... But the news tell us what else ... I do not think anyone still uses this signal. I hope my English is understandable. Tell me if not, so that no misunderstandings arise.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Yes signals are like "closing the barn door after the horses are out"... And running down the hillside. Oh we got this signal... So trading the news is a whole different way to trade. Have to understand the impact of the news on investors and traders. It's not even what the data itself means, it's what the financial community thinks the data means..... So it is out of the range of the focus of this thread. It a different topic for a whole different thread. How to stay focused. thank you for your help... Ja, das ist dein Englisch ziemlich schlecht. Aber es ist viel besser als mein Deutsch. Irgendwie ist der Sinn kommt durch.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
You're right. I wish you a nice afternoon, Wandler.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Signal EURUSD: Long. EURGBP up GBPUSD up USDCAD: Short.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Jiva, if you would give mechanical rules for this system what would it be ? On your previous thread I said that the backtests were not too bad with the basic rules, I would like to improve this. Think it would be a good idea to choose one or two pairs and stick with it.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Does anyone even look at the first page?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I did look at the first page I'm asking for more ideas

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thank you for your interest in helping us develop this strategy. If you can follow along with us as we experiment with it and also share some of your own experiences, actual experiences, feel free to post some charts with notes about how you have tried to take the trades, etc. then we can try to work to together. I am posting in as much detail as time and my limited energies will allow and try to remain open to ideas from others. So if you want to you can also post some details of your own efforts and we can try to work together. As long as we stay focused on the main strategy (first page). Sometimes someone has some new angle of vision, see Wandler's posts, he has lots of good different angles but is staying with the main idea. as far as mechanical rules, there some rough guidelines for mechanical. These are already on the first page and throughout the thread. I really don't want to rehash. The way it works in the forum is traders follow a thread for some time, get the feel for that particular effort and share what they are doing to test the system. So feel free to join us as we move along together. Let us know how your efforts are going. Try some trades on demo. It is helpful if we can see what you are actually doing. The free flow of ideas on the forum is what stimulates more ideas. It is give and take. So we are also interested in what you may have to give. We are all in this together. None of us are millionaires, yet.. I like to focus on EURUSD myself. It is plenty active enough to find entries. One entry a day is enough really. Can be worth over 100 pips. 3 positions. Wandler likes to hop in and out with 10 or 20 pips of whatever pair meets his other criteria along with the 2 bar reversal. We look forward to finding out more about what you are doing... Thank you again for your interest.

Friday Asia's quiet...

--- 帖子 #248 ---
day chart. testing the 200 ema strong resistance using volume is new to me but if I am getting it right as long as volume is increasing with the move then the move is strong. So a break through is likely. I wouldn't think it would be today, Friday, no US or EUR data to fuel the fire and EUR data is very light all next week. Could be a failed break through temporarily. Range bound.. So I don't know If I will trade any of the signals should they come. Maybe just 1 position and look for 10 or 15 pips instead of using the 3 positions and looking for a big move.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
So using that line of reasoning: If EURGBP up GBPJPY up if signal long EURJPY, trade?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Sssh......you woke up the Euro cheers

--- 帖子 #251 ---
out of 15 pairs only 1 signal GBPJPY and was good for maybe 10 to 15 pips...Asia slow after all the commotion last couple of days... Taking target 10 or 15 pips may be best choice if there are signals. Hmm.. We like to look for consolidation and then the breakout for the 3 position strategy. Many of the pairs are not consolidating around the pivot they are either high or low which means to me that there is some stalling or possible retracing. So then that would make sense to look for a smaller profit target if there should be some trades taken.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Jiva I'm an automated trader I don't trade manually that is why I'm always open for new ideas. Some strategies cannot work because defining SR areas and chart patterns are more important than the actual entry and exit signals. I apologsie if I have frustrated you in any way From my findings this system cannot function mechanically, human intuition is a neccesity. Also as you have showed us areas of interesest are very important. Will see what I can do

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I see. Can you program? I believe it would be possible to automate according to trading times with some measure of success.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Signal in the favorite EURUSD So we will set for 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
since we are holding the cards close as they say took 7.5 pips it did reach the 10 pip target..

--- 帖子 #256 ---
AUDUSD will set for 10 pips with Frankfurt about to open..

--- 帖子 #257 ---
jittery light volume probably will go higher, but hopped out... not enough to cover spread. Better that than sorrrryyyyy.. Was looking for a little boost from Frankfurt.. very little boost... It's Friday.............

--- 帖子 #258 ---
The AUDUSD trade was good... at least for the 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
London in 15 minutes. let's see what if any...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
rule of thumb Heading away from the pivot and out of consolidation 3 position strategy heading back towards the pivot after a significant move, 1 position 10 pip tgt.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
retail figures for GBP today. long signal but would wait for news..... want to enter in such a way that 20 pips can be reached fairly quickly so stops can be moved above break even.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
saw the high volume on breakout of consolidation 3 positions in place we want to get to 20 pips as soon as possible. I was going to wait for news, but I jumped for the bait, the false breakout.. Now I have been stuck in consolidation again for the last 1/2 hour and have to cast my fate to the wind when the news comes out. Lesson. Wait for then news release.. (Only thing is, it's the pound and this thing is volatile, could snap back and we are still hanging on to positions). Oh, how I miss you, EURUSD)!! http://www.vectorstock.com/composite...ies-vector.jpg

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Yes I can program

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Sometimes bad figures act like good news. That is, if the figures aren't as bad as was expected. It's not like there is panic selling, probably just a slow drift lower.. I hate the pound, lesson just stay with the EURUSD.. If the the trade comes out ok it is sheer luck.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
So that is why you are looking at the different strategies. To see if they can be automated nicely. This would not be too difficult to program i would think. Since there are not a zillion indicators. Just the 2 bar reverse. And time of day. Perhaps you would consider just a one order with simple stop. And time of day option. The 2 bar reverse indi. as a test to see if there is any edge on the market with this in it's simplest form. Just an idea.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I have already written a strategy in java for the rules you gave, it's not working. The only way this will work (mechanically) is for a larger stop loss and takeprofit. In your opinion what is the best time of day to trade? Open of the London session ?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
yes, London open, not just my opinion,opinion of the world I think.............. not to complicate things unnecessarily, , the signal should be traded on breakout of consolidation, prices higher than previous 20 bars for instance, and on high volume higher than previous bar.... "volume teacher" indi calculates this nicely.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
If you have a minute and care to tinker, would you be so kind as to add a sound alert (optional t/f) and pop up to the indi?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
GBPUSD may be recuperating.... http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...6nOgGpVaulB2Mg I still miss EURUSD,

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Mmm.... Ok will see what I can do.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Sure will post asap

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Something weird happened to me, my alert dialog box is missing cannot find it! Read that it happens when you move multiple monitors around. Will first have to fix this issue before I can test the indi.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
See attached for the indi. My alert window is still missing so I cannot see if the displayed message is correct. Please let me know if something is wrong. The indi checks three bars, so three alerts will go off for one arrow on three consecutive bars.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
if Signal Long ... But this is no rule ... Used for confirmation and definitions of the more. We you said, the strategy is and remains 2 Reversal Bar. Currency Crosses present you with more opportunities. Major pairs: Can not decide whether to buy EUR/USD or sell USD/CHF ... Look EUR/CHF ... buy USD/CHF or USD/JPY ... Look CHF/JPY ... buy EUR/USD or sell USD/JPY ... Look EUR/JPY ... buy GBP/USD or sell USD/CHF ... Look GBP/CHF ... buy GBP/USD or sell USD/JPY ... Look GBP/JPY ... Examples of Currency Correlations: Typical same direction moving EUR/USD &amp; GBP/USD EUR/USD &amp; AUD/USD EUR/USD &amp; NZD/USD USD/CHF &amp; USD/JPY AUD/USD &amp; NZD/USD Typical inversely moving EUR/USD &amp; USD/CHF GBP/USD &amp; USD/JPY USD/CAD &amp; AUD/USD USD/JPY &amp; AUD/USD GBP/USD &amp; USD/CHF PS.: You were not there, I've posted the signals ... I hope this is OK and has helped someone.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thank you, powers that be.. Dumb trade but we survived... Timing all wrong.. Before major data release.... duh... http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...w437bQdjOCtNZg

--- 帖子 #277 ---
It is helping me. I will study this more. thank you very much. The more we can understand what is going on in the market place the better our decisions for trading will be.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Thank you. It seems to be working quite well. That was good thinking to make it sound for 3 bars. So many booby traps and obstacles. We hope you find the box without too much waste of time..

--- 帖子 #279 ---
... can not understand why you have made this trade so late. can you explain it to me ... Many thanks in advance. PS.: My Trade to day (EU Sassion): EURUSD long NZDUSD long USDCAD short

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I was going to wait for news, but I jumped for the bait, the false breakout .. new high out of consolidation on volume, but it was a false move the news had bnot been released yet. You are doing quite well today. I will be interested to study and understand more about your analysis.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
The problem I am seeing is that I do not have big enough picture of the marketplace. That means not just one currency pair but the mood of the whole market because all the pairs are interrelated. You are helping us to see how this very important and how to evaluate this. So this is very much appreciated. For someone who wants to just try to catch 5 or 10 pips here or there they may try to do this with just mechanical means on a short time frame, but if we want nice gains with good risk to reward, then we must look at the bigger picture.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I hope we can learn from each other. Current situation (16 Clock signal) GBPUSD ... up (signal Long) USDJPY ... up GBPJPY is interesting ... Signal Long.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hold down alt and space, then press "m" and click &lt; &gt; arrow keys until it appears, if not after 10-15 clicks in one direction use other arrow. It will finally come sliding onto present screen. Thanks for the alert, Paul

--- 帖子 #284 ---
You are using setting for reversal breakout candles 60min?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I am done trading for the day and the week. Will check back to the thread from time to time. And put some time into research and study. It was a good week. Next week will be good too. Enjoy the weekend.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I use MTF. I trade the price ... depending on price ... 2 Rev. Bar Strategy. My English is bad ... perhaps as: It is not important to me how much I win, it's important that I win. If you knew 100% that you win with next trade 10 pips, would you be tomorrow Millionaire ... You know what I mean?! Or perhaps so: What is better ... 90% chance to win 10 pips or 10% to win 100 pips?! The answer is ... your RR and good nerves. That is why I say one more time ... MTF, MD, News and MM. About EA ... I can program, but ... OK, another Thread. Very good week ... Enjoy the weekend. best regards, Wandler.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I think this is a very good way to make decisions when a signal does appear. Already it is know what direction the pair is most likely to move. Just using indicators like moving average or others, macd etc is not so reliable but can help. But even better to have the benefit of understand the correlations between pairs. So to be looking for a signal short because it is already determined the pair is moving down. A really good way to determine trend. This is new to me although I knew some traders do this. Correlations. So maybe it will take a little time to get it right. Starting now. Go Wandler!!!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
The forums are excellent facility for learning from each other. The free exchange of ideas and techniques creates a fertile atmosphere for development of strategies. I think this kind of free exchange of ideas is going on in all areas of human endeavor right now. It is very exciting time. Communication... Across all geographical, philosophical, religious, gender, racial, etc. A real revolution. Forums, networking... There is a huge communication wave or undercurrent that is sweeping human society. Internet infrastructure. The main body of society is still somewhat asleep but the communication system is waking up. Like the nervous system. Just miraculous. Okay, off topic a bit. But yes we can learn from each other..

--- 帖子 #289 ---
this is interesting topic, thank you for sharing. mason

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Here they come. The march of the indicators. Usually when the chart starts getting crowded with them it means I've lost focus. We shall see. Am experimenting with cci 2 settings. 14 and 55. It is little helpful in simulated practice sessions to get a better entry when a breakout signal appears. I am little surprised to see that cci repaints? Comparing screenshots there is definitely repainting. But still the indicator was helpful to avoid bad entries even if it did repaint later, at the time the entries were too early after a signal due some retracing before the main move. The check mark on the chart shows where the 55 cci was above the 0 line when the long was taken but later it is showing below. The candle had closed when the cci was above 0, I am pretty sure of that. Will keep on the watch. Am looking for both cci's to be going in the direction of the signal. If they both cross the 0 line is it strong affirmation. macd is there primarily to mark possible exits on a cross.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Another example of what I was looking for for confirmation of a signal Here the cci did not repaint very much and stayed above 0.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
whoa, this is really strange. It is not repainting exactly. It appears that by dragging the chart view to the left or the right it changes the visually representation of the indicator in relationship to 0. Yikes... a bug in the graphics... no wait, it's a bug in my brain!!!! the cci's are superimposed and each has it's 0 line... okay I need toi find the cci coded by Bob I have in my files somewhere where 2 (even 3) settings of cci are in sync... I like the idea behind this but now I have get the details right... nuts and bolts...

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Ea is very good in many ways. Although I have not found one that is reliable enough for me to put real money, I have learned very much about trading by studying how to make the ea itself and also by testing it. Maybe at some point we would want to develop automatic trades but I think we would have to get the strategy to be very, very reliable first.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thanks a million I would never have figured that ou!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
An EA that actually makes money will be the holy grail of forex. I myself am a bit skeptic if it can be done, but short term strategies does work. A better way to use an EA is to decrease your time in front of the PC. All you have to do manually confirm if the trade is good or not and let the EA handle everything from there on. That works like a charm

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Yes, supervision needed for our automated friend. Better if he asks permission first to spend our money. He has a good idea and then we approve or not. The robot works for us... But we must be the boss... I agree.. The indicator works for us too, but he does not know how to actually trade. He just likes to point things out. If he works with the adviser they can be a good team. But we must be the boss. Traders have the idea to let these workers have free reign. Just set the adviser up and go on vacation come back a millionaire. Nice dream. http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...0Fv9x84ZaxVpbQ Come back and find you have to live in your car, workers have spent all your money. And your trading business is finished. http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...fkehzcXAmz5RsQ

--- 帖子 #297 ---
LOL, I like your visuals hehe. I'm busy with an EA, will post it at my forum when finished. I'm not sure if this has been discussed, but should we not pay attention to the candle stick pattern? Some candle sticks should obviously not be taken as they can be a trend reversal pattern or whatever.. http://candlestickforum.com/PPF/Para...andlestick.asp

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Definitely. I may have not stated that enough. I think I see it as a given. For the ea, keep me up to date...

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Okay, I found the file I was looking for DRBobcci. too many indicators is a mess for trading. cci to help with entry, macd for exits and general trend. maybe it is not too many. the chart shows what I am looking for on the 15 min when there is a 2bar reversal signal on the 4hr. Time of day, news, correlations these are to be considered also.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Bullish/Bearish engulfing patterns seems to give the highest propability trades.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Especially if the 1st candle in the pattern closes outside the bb bands (which are simply a form of probability calculated to appear as bands-a measure of deviation from a mean) and the 2nd candle closes inside.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
In the 3 position strategy the 3rd position is not performing very well. It was meant for catching a big move. 1st set for 20, 2nd set for 50 and 3rd trailed no set tgt. But it is simply falling back for less then the 2nd position. I may change the strategy to either just 2 positions. 20 and 50 Or keep the 3 positions 20, 30, 50.. There is another way to manage positions by entering pyramid style, scaling in rather than scaling out. I want to spend some time this week looking into pyramiding.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
we have the EURUSD signal short but prices are sitting solidly on the wood pivot. They would have break convincingly below that support to take a trade short. Where is Wandler? I am looking for correlations. Looks like USD strength in the other pairs. USDCHF But also EUR strength. EURJPY

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Frankfurt open, signal short remains from previous bar, dip below wood pivot cci 55 below 0. Looking for 20, 30. which would take us to 38 fib retrace and s1 correlations: USDJPY up USDCAD up EURGBP down Wandler, am I doing this right?? London about to open....

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Pretty sure the short has more to go. at least to s1 which is also fib 38.. closed early.. retrace trades don't have much legs. the main thrust is long, pretty sure of that. Wait for another signal would expect long.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
went to s1. and the 38 fib. The strategy is good if I had kept in with both positions as is the strategy the first would be out at 20 and the second would still be in looking for 30 which it will reach no doubt. Most likely the strong support at the 200 ema will be the next area of consolidation. edit: looks like I called it right, but not in the trade anymore. Long AUDUSD, let's hope I got that one right.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I like GBPUSD long. It could be a while before a signal. maybe getting closer to US mkts...

--- 帖子 #308 ---
What's with EURCHF? Swiss bank intervention? Oh I see some headlines: 2011/01/24 05:52:55 FX OPTIONS: EUR/CHF "Massive" 1.3000 Expiry Today

--- 帖子 #309 ---
AUDUSD long?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
long audusd 20, 30 tgts are at 200 ema on 4hr..

--- 帖子 #311 ---
EURJPY short better? Actually I wouldn't short either of them unless there was some real conviction selling.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
yes very good was away from trading desk.. but yes audusd was good too. US fed speak this week... But wouldn't you know it, all last week I used the 3 position strategy to try to catch a big move with the 3rd position. No luck. So today I dropped back to 2 positions to reduce risk. And there it is the big move. A 3rd position would still be riding....

--- 帖子 #313 ---
USDCHF since you are short term trader maybe close now, it is going to lunch time NY, But over all there seems to be quite a bit more downside next few days. Same with EURUSD, has just broken through daily and weekly very strong resistance, 200ema. lot more upside. but time of days says maybe there is some pulling back now, lunch time NY... so short term trader maybe take the money and run. maybe going to stall at yesterday's r3 my best guess, but by end of day could well be past today's r1

--- 帖子 #314 ---
thank you for the exchange of views. 2 heads better than one...

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Where did you get the setup for all the pairs on one screen like this?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Wandler, Posting the correlations as supportive analysis for using the 2 reversal bar entry signals is much appreciated. Please don't delete those posts. Question: trying to get these correlations straight. If I wanted trade AUDUSD. And there was a signal long Would I look at EURAUD for short EURUSD for long to confirm a long signal AUDUSD? Maybe using a kind of short hand. AUD&gt;EUR (EURAUD down) EUR&gt;USD (EURUSD up) so AUD&gt;USD long signal confirmed.. Is this the basic idea?? note: Am working with this idea for little while now. But the problem I have with using correlations to help confirm signals is that because the pairs are correlated when they turn they all turn together. So one minute they are all confirming, then the next minute they have all changed course and the confirmations are gone.

Lots of signals, but I don't like any of them. A lot of volatility is back in the market. Fed speak and rates tomorrow. Big moves yesterday.. Will wait a bit before taking any trades.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
NZDUSD is a possibility. But I would want the cci55 and 14 to be below 0... Strong area of support at the 200ema and the wood pivot...

--- 帖子 #319 ---
GBPUSD maybe as a short, but it is sitting on obvious trend line. Theme so far seems to still be dollar strength... going into Fed Weds.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
entered short, 3 positions 20, 50 and a runner.. broke trend line, we want to get to 20 as soon as possible, move stops for remaining 2 postions to break even + spread.. free ride from then on.. But get ready for a bumpy ride, after all this is the pound... AND there's GBP GDP in 2 hours... I don't know if I even want to watch this... Dramamine anyone?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
bounce off the 200ema on the 30mmin and a retest of the trend line now as resistance...

--- 帖子 #322 ---
cci and macd on the 1 hour both encouraging as we head into London open..

--- 帖子 #323 ---
closed 2 positions early. moved stop to break even +4 for the third. Free ride if we should drop... no loss if we spike back up..

--- 帖子 #324 ---
stopped out + 30 pips total for trade.. Now we wait for new signals...

The short went to s1 which I had originally targeted. this happens a lot. My targets are right on, then there is little sea sickness, and I jump ship. the only remedy I can think of is to keep trading the strategy and gain more more and more confidence in it. I think it is because there have been times a small winner turned into a big loser so I am a little shell shocked. But that was not with this strategy. So it is not reasonable for me to have a flash back like that and panic when this strategy is right on. We get to practice again...

--- 帖子 #326 ---
NZDUSD is setting up. I may have entered a bit early. I wanted to see cci55 cross below 0, but there strong USD strength in all the pairs. So I entered a little early. So let's see if I can stay with it this time. The pound was the trade this morning going into Britain GDP. US consumer confidence could move NZDUSD There are so many little pieces to the puzzle. I may have overlooked something in this trade that is pretty significant. The strategy calls for a breakout from consolidation at the pivot. NZDUSD is above the pivot and the trade I have entered short bring the pair back to the pivot rather than leaving it. I completely overlooked this aspect and it is an important part of the strategy. Can't seem to hold it all in my pea-sized brain at the same time. another reason simple is best. So this is a retracing move rather than breakout. they tend to be not so dramatic and are the ones that end up being losers. In order to reach my targets the pair would need to retrace to the pivot and break below it on the way to s1. So that would have to be a deep retracement or an all and all reversal on the is time frame. That's a lot to ask for. I think we will reach the oivot which is about a 50fib retrace. If we can reach the pivot for 20 pips then there is no sweat. Stops moved to break even + spread and then evaluate the situation. Meanwhile GBPUSD has dropped 80 pips. My 3 positions which I closed for a total of +30 if I had left them alone would now be worth +150pips and still going...

One thing I am seeing is the pullback to test a trend line is actually a very good sign that a big move is on the way. It may be the last of the buyers in a short move and then there is no one left to buy and the move south begins in earnest. That may also be where other chickens like me jump out...and then miss the boat. So practice and more practice and get know the ins and outs... We want to now as much we can about what is happening in the trade.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
One thing that helps to stay in the trade is to watch the candles as they ride the bb bands. If there are no alarming candle formations and the candles are riding the bands without closing outside then inside, then the move is going along smoothly.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
because this trade was a return to the pivot and not a breakout from the pivot I closed at the pivot (where it meets the 200ema at strong support) + 37 pips total for the 3 positions.. Couldn't help noticing the tremendous move in the Pound. I had that trade in place. Let me thankful I collected what I did collect and that my lament is that I didn't stay in it longer rather than lamenting that I got caught on the wrong side of it...

--- 帖子 #330 ---
looking back at the GBPUASD trade that was cut way short of the potential. i see 2 things could have helped me stay in the trade that i did not consider. #1. the candles following the bb bands without any breach. No closing outside then closing inside, a sign of a possible reversal and certainly a retrce of sme sort. #2. the move would have legs, because it was moving out of consolidation and way from the pivot level. The move went 200 pips!!!! My three positions would have brought 20, 50 and 200 + 270 pips....!!! But I must be getting better at trading because I was on the right of the trade !!

It was out of topic. AUDUSD ... Look JPY or CAD. But this is no rule ... it's Typical. Perhaps a simple example: GBP USD Signal = Long &amp; GBP JPY Signal = Long ... What are you doing? You look at USDJPY ... if " USD &gt; JPY" then you are buying GBPJPY else GBPUSD. Maybe you first want to do such simple comparisons and then expand. Perhaps a simple example for expand: EUR USD Signal Long &amp; USD CHF Signal Short ... Look at EURCHF . or GBPUSD Long &amp; USDJPY Short ... Look GBPJPY ... the same GBPUSD Long &amp; GBPJPY Short ... Look USDJPY. That's easy ... I'm sure you'll quickly learn that. Ask me if you have any questions, I try to help. best regards, Wandler. PS.: Very good trading day, almost perfect.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I don't see how it is out of topic. The 2 reversal bar signal is an initial signal that a possible trade is there. But we need to confirm it with other sources. Market times, correlations, proximity to support and resistance, etc. Thank you for bringing our attention to this valuable resource. Please keep us posted as to correlations you might be seeing, then our reversal bar signals can be confirmed. Thank you, as ever. I hope you were you able to catch some of the moves today, especially in the pound?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I was in position for the GBPUSD drop, but did not stay the course.only +67.. yes multi time frame... everything seen on multi time frames... What do you think? flat going into fed speak?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
WEF and fed speak.. volatility...

Wandler, not my style... I am looking for 3 positions and big moves out of consolidation. I think the most risk is when we enter a trade. It can go against us. My strategy is to find the big moves and reach 20 pips as soon as possible so to be able to move stop loss to break even + spread. Now I will have 2 positions no loss possible and the sky is the limit. If a trader is confident of their strategy and it means going in and out of trades a lot for small profits then that is their style . But in general it is the most difficult and risky type of trading... I am not comfortable with trading in that way. Once I find a good entry I want to stay in it as long as possible. So this is what I am practicing. the breakout of the 2 reversal candles in the 4hr lends itself exceptionally well to finding these types of entries. Hopping in and out is a different strategy. The use of correlations to try to confirm entries is on topic but hopping in and out of trades as a strategy is not on topic. We do not want to be hopping in and out of trades for a few pips here and a few pips there. I am sure it is profitable for you and others who trade that way. But it is not what we are focusing on here. We want to get in and stay in. 3 positions. That is the strategy. For a return to the pivot we will take only 2 positions. We might take only 1 or 2 trades in a day but they can be worth 200 pips each... We are seeing how to develop this. Please do not distract us with all the hopping. We wish you well. jiva

We appreciate that you are doing something that is working for you. What it is exactly I really don't know. I do know what I am trying to do. And to some degree it is working. How we are managing the trades is a bit different. I am looking to get in and stay in, you are looking for lots of trades and hopping out. But to find good entries we can agree, perhaps to some degree. And certainly to be able to understand what is going on in price action is invaluable for any type of trading. If you have something to share in a bit more detail about how you are able to make entry decisions based on what you are seeing in price action, we would be interested to hear. We are open to new ideas and angles of vision.

Today will be a tough day I am sure. Lots of uncertainty in the air. WEF and Fed. Different comments from different members at WEF can take it up one minute and then someone else from WEF speaks to the press and takes it down the next. And who knows for sure what the Fed will say and do. Flat most of the day I suspect. Maybe some movement just before Feds. maybe some movement right after Feds. Just a tough day... Yes we are trading signals but I also like to know as much as I can about what is going on in the markets.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Against my better judgment I placed a trade. Simply because of fed day I had thought not to trade unless there was clear movement. But gold looks like a sell off and the signal was there. I just don't know if this is the best entry place. We want to move 20 pips as soon as possible for safety.. The monthly chart has a screaming bearish engulfing forming...

--- 帖子 #339 ---
fed day jitters sitting on support reached the 20 pips 2nd position stopped out spread+ closed 3rd before it could stop out. We want to try to learn from every trade. Gold is pretty much the only thing moving in at least some sort of trend today before fed. don't want to push my luck. so ended trade early. Sitting on strong support. That's it for now. Will check back around fed time.... note: Looks like fed is a non event....

Supplement: That's no rules, but will only serve to confirm the Signal. Typical same direction moving EUR/USD &amp; GBP/USD USD/CHF &amp; USD/JPY AUD/USD &amp; NZD/USD EUR/USD &amp; AUD/USD EUR/USD &amp; NZD/USD Follow currency pairs that tend to move in the same direction or parallel when the US Dollar strengthens or weakens. Example: if EURUSD Long Signal &amp; GBPUSD rises (or better yet also Long Signal) then Signal Confirmed. Typical inversely moving EUR/USD &amp; USD/CHF GBP/USD &amp; USD/JPY USD/CAD &amp; AUD/USD USD/JPY &amp; AUD/USD GBP/USD &amp; USD/CHF Follow currency pairs that tend to move in the opposite direction or inverse when the US Dollar strengthens or weakens. Example: if EURUSD Long Signal &amp; USDCHF falls (or better Short Signal) then Signal Confirmed. best regards, Wandler.

thank you, we will find this most helpful....

we will look for weakness in the pound and a signal short.GBPJPY dollar strength... short GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #224 ---
1 hour before Frankfurt open. long EURCHF However with my usual inattentiveness I somehow overlooked that the slow rsx had not crossed. Whether EURCHF has any legs long in the short term or not is now questionable. r1 is just above and most likely we will reach that. and then perhaps a retest of the recent high.. If we can reach 20 pips no sweating... note: actually they have crossed. I had forgotten the indi is not coded for 3 rsx, I concocted the indi by superimposing 3 rsx settings on the one window. the zero lines are not matched. If I calculate the difference in the zero lines there has been a cross. So we should be okay for the targets. Any coders out there hovering? Need an indi with settings for 3 rsx's in line form....

would look for short signal silver

--- 帖子 #226 ---
looks like strong EUR and strong dollar. weak pound... look for long EURGBP..

--- 帖子 #227 ---
First time trying this. trading what I see. Entered short before prices turn. note: I can see where in some cases entering early would be good, but as a general rule. Safer to wait for a confirmed break out even if it means letting some pips get away.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
same with EURGBP entering long before prices turn based on what I am seeing...

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Japan ratings cut from aa to aa- sending markets into a tizzy. Spikes everywhere. My analysis although very likely correct, the positions are getting challenged by the spikes on the news. Stops are in place. I widened some of them because of the whip saws. Added 3 more long positions to EURCHF. btw. I am only trading demo... I am in no way ready to trade my hard earned money yet....

--- 帖子 #230 ---
the template sure is pretty. But am going back to something more plain. Too much going on, loses focus. tutti fruity....

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Jiva, Are you still trading this strategy? Best regards, BC2

--- 帖子 #232 ---
No.. am over here... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post4657777

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Revisiting this strategy after 7 months.. The indi repaints but it's good more times than not, so if the signal is bad, the stop will be hit. But that's what trading is. this is the trading history for today. very impressive.. amazingly the preset stops and limits coincide very nicely with pivots and support and resistance. the pair should be trending, if the pair is consolidating, wait. Don't trade. If this keeps up I might have to trade a mini account instead of the micro.

Hi Jiva, What a nice and promising thread u r having here. Just wanna suggest some input for those still questioning the RR etc. Some might say that this system is doomed to fail in the long run; and so do all other systems in FF BUT, perhaps some of us would want to consider giving it a try and trade it at D1. At least, I am seriously considering my option at D1. 1st bull candle at D1, I load my buy on the next D1, (vice versa for bear candle), and will let it run for as long as it could. SL should be slightly lower than the low of the 1st candle (Low 96.96), risking 2% of course,and will have to manually calculate that 2% risks based how many pip to that low and depending on my trading capital, to come out with the lot size. I strongly believe that the more trades we take, the more and higher the risks we r taking. This is where we r doomed in the long run. Thus, by taking only 1-2 trades weekly once the criteria (as per this thread) r met, much much less risks r involved (i.e. only 2% to 4% weekly). In the end, all that matters are whether my account is been blown out again or NOT. I am using EMA20 Low as a filter. As per the chart attached, USDJPY seems to have passed the criteria and here we go... I've learned the hard way that we MUST never play around too much with risks. Thanks
