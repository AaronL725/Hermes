We're all here to generate pips. Fresh edit 1 March 2019. This is not my creation. This will likely be my KWAN !! I trade the 1h, 4h, and Daily due to work obligations. This will work on all TF. I trade many pairs. Beware the spread (it's the cost or running a business). This strategy is designed to catch not only reversals, but trend continuations as well. Max risk is your quarrel, not mine! (we're all here for max pips) My personal max is 3% daily, 1% on any 1 trade... .5% on regular divergence trades. I use Heiken Ashi candles combined with stochastics (settings of 8,3,3), overbought is 80, oversold is 20. (close/close) (exp.). Humans are visual creatures, hence the HA candles. HA are much easier on the eyes. Do not forget when plotting your candles to switch from candlesticks to line charts. I have recently added a 5 EMA (3 shift) to show trend direction and momentum. The winners far outweigh the losers. I like the way the TDI reacts to PA. I will consider reversals when courting the 32 and 68 levels. TC are also considered depending upon where the price is within a wave. If I'm trading using the TDI, I wait for a complete cross of thick lines. My biggest success has been using indicators to spot HD. This journey began with 'trading made simple' post. It's a very popular thread. I've tried to replace the TDI with a stochastics. In so many of these trades, a simple trend line break could've had most traders making nice pips. Alas, EDIT... my replacement for the TDI indicator is the RSI (14)/14 EMA in the same window. Most of my trades are now HD. Same thing as a TC, or trend continuation trade. I now wait for a complete cross of the stochastic. I will say if you get good at Hidden Divergence, you will have pips coming out of your ears. Stochastics 8, 3, 3 for divergence and trend direction. With a RSI/EMA (14) combined in it's own window. Please be aware, when the stochastics extend to either 80 or 20, that does not mean the price WILL reverse, it may continue without a reverse. This post has been edited on 8/13/17 Manage-- one can set a take profit for 1:1, I often use fractals for my trail stops. In addition, a trader can take half of their risk (R) out of the market at 1:1 and let the rest run, trailing the 'runner' with stops at or near fractals (highs and lows). This will help. This can be used on any TF. I cannot recall nor I have been shown back to back losses. I do not frequent the way low TF. I have added a price chart with trend lines. The green vertical lines are entries. Very important, the chart shows Hidden Divergence (HD), not a reversal trade. Always always use a SL. If you're new to trading, head to Babypips and test yourself through each and every year. Study pyramiding and divergences while you're there. Study MTF while you're there. I've done it and most of the traders reading have done it. I begin with a daily chart, then 4H. When I get bored, it's the 1H. You can trade any TF. I look for a change in color of the current candle for a reversal. This post has more than enough marked charts to know what I'm looking at and looking for. If you want lots of daytime action in your trading, you may find it in this strategy. For best results, trade 1H and higher. Rarely do I strive for a 1:1 trade. Rarely do I use a TP. I believe in letting all trades run. Good questions to begin a checklist include. What is my balance? What max $ amount am I willing to risk today? Have I plotted at least 4 areas of SR? I am ____ pips away from parity. With experience comes incredible decisions that should ultimately lead you to better trades. Enjoy, Renofaith

I have a full time job, I could've taken the majority of these trades.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
If you want to be greedy and squeeze every pip out that you can, head down to the 15m or the 5m charts. I don't have the stomach for that. I'll be cheering you on my friend. This is nearly perfect for me. I'm simply sharing. Greetings and best wishes to all !!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I check my charts every 4 hours, Once stochastics hits either overbought or oversold, go to the 1H and watch for the Stochastics to do the same thing. Here's another winner folks. A very recent winner !!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Stochastics is a bit sloppy looking, but I haven't lost a dime yet. It's coming. And yes, this thread is not about divergence, but I'm gonna trade it when I see it. The chart here may be my first loser. EUR/AUD 1H

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I risk a max of 3% daily. I use fibs depending upon what PA tells me. Pin Bars are a big help but not a must. I do NOT check FF for news announcements. I carry trades over the weekend (be wise with that close/open spread), I trade holidays and always have. The first time I traded the NFP, it was a mistake!! I won the trade BIG that day. I was so caught up, I didn't realize it was Friday (use caution on that one). I have a written set of DAILY GOALS and a TRADING CHECKLIST!!!! Trade to your comfort level. I'm a massive risk taker at 3% because I 'feel' I can recover. I'm not greedy. If you want to learn stacking or pyramiding, google it please! I'm constantly reading, reading, and reading. I love forex. I wish an abundance of pips to all. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #7 ---
EUR/AUD STOCHASTICS WK overbought and coming down. D1 oversold and moving up 4H overbought and coming down 1H was overbought it's been coming down. interesting!! How good is this SNIPER TRADE ??

--- 帖子 #8 ---
very interesting keep the charts coming Cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #9 ---
USD/CAD 1H I don't mind waiting 4H for a smooth setup at 7 am before you jump in the car and head to the box. I always check the 4H first.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Maybe you all like to overthink this stuff. I know I did for a long time. This is easy peasy !!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
This is kinda how I do it. 1. Scan 15 pairs ever 4 hours looking for the SIGNAL line to close above/below the 80/20. 2. Identify the pairs (write them down). 3. Pull up the hourly charts and wait for a stochastic crossover or a change in candle color. 4. There is your entry friends. 5. Exits, worse case scenario 1:1. There will be losing trades, I've spotted them, although I have not participated in any yet. This is forex. It probably wouldn't hurt to monitor news events. I don't. I wont. You can!!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Renofaith, Thanks for your system So.. entry is the cross on H4 and H1 and exit on 1:1 ratio first order and second order till it reaches other end of the Stoch Thanks R

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I'm not gonna lie friends, I would have probably taken both trades, but note the daylight on the stochastics readings. Hope this helps someone who maybe doesn't have much time to trade. I love staring at PA. I got stuff to do!! CAUTION... I don't think this makes a difference, but my sto setting is on the hi/low.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
The stochastic on a buy needs to breach AND CLOSE above the 80, preferably with plenty of daylight, on the 4H. Then go to 1H for entry. I pull triggers on crosses 1H, also if the lines are touching 1H, but a cross is best 1H. thank you for your comment. Hope this helps, renofaith

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks Brother To be more precise Daylight means enough gap? Thanks R

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I forgot your exit... what you do is very similar to what I do. On the other hand, if PA gives me a winner MINUS 3 PIPS, I will go for BE, i.e. stop loss very close to the entry. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Absolutely !! You got this !! Best of luck rookie !!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thank you for the kind words Paul, hope this stuff helps. I totally enjoy it. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Would anyone like a couple hundred pips before lunch on Tuesday? Gotta be willing to let it sit through the weekend. Gotta have plenty of wiggle room for the Friday close and the Sunday open. Very doable. EUR/JPY has always been my favorite pair. Oops, forgot, the small red arrow is the entry candle, NOT the one before !!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
you mean to place a buy order around tomorrow or now itself? Thanks R

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I moved the vertical line to the right on purpose to show what would've happen if you got in a hurry and entered on the candle that is to the left of the arrow. You would have lost due to the high of the pin bar. It's best to wait for the stochastic cross and then enter on the close of that candle. That would have been a sell order, the candle at the red arrow. I moved the vertical to the right one candle 'on purpose" to show you. Hope that helps. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #21 ---
It's best to always know where parity is (green line) X.XX00. I threw in a trend line for good measure. I like the direction this one is going. I'm not 'out of the woods yet though', by any stretch. EUR/AUD always a very erratic pair.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
When I wake up, I'm gonna be down some pips, or up some pips. I've put all the odds in my favor that concern me. I'd be most delighted with win #10 in a row. That's never happened for me. Greetings and blessings to all. P.S. win, lose, or draw... we will ALL win, it'll teach us, again..... the market is never wrong. renofaith

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Oh my goodness, that is so cool. I didn't know what else to call it. I just want to help my friends and neighbors. Thank you so much for the pic. An avalanche of blessings to you my friend. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Don't forget to throw on some trend lines. Add them to your rules if you wish. They're free !!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
This trade took about an hour to setup. 3 entries. Price is still hangin' on. Very sloppy stochastic made me very apprehensive. It worked out.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
In real time, the stochastics may appear to present a buy/sell signal, however by the time the candle has ended, may have completely changed, how do you account for that? Or do you wait until the candle is finished? Also I think even if the candle is finished the stochastic line still can change based on the next few candles. I'm talking about repaint

--- 帖子 #28 ---
which pair and which time frame are you looking at rookie?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thank you for your comment, since I trade mostly 1H candles, I may wait from 5 minutes to 5 hours (consolidation of course) to make an entry. I totally wait for the candle to finish. Hope this helps. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I've spent around 3 years trading mostly Japanese candlesticks, moving averages, and C.C.I., with success. I'm very new to the Heiken Ashi candle. I'm ok with the stochastics. With this strategy, I can literally glance for less than 60 seconds and know if I need to head to the 1H chart. I trade every pair I can (15). Spread to me is a simple 6 letter word. NEVER begrudge spending a dollar to make 2 dollars !! I know... opinions vary on that. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks for sharing your trading system renofaith. Which candle is the entry candle after the HA candle changed? Is it just after the first set up candle has been closed or the third and fourth are still valid entry as long as the Stochastic has just bounce back and cross 20 or 80 level ? Regarding your EA trade, Stochastic has not cross level 80 in 4H TF, is it still valid?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
On the entries, the entry is the changed color HA candle. In most cases, the stochastic is headed in your direction AND the colored lines (value and signal) are either touching or have already crossed, preferably already crossed. The stochastics are of little concern at this point. The stochastic in my current trade doesn't have to breach BELOW the 80 for an entry on either time frame. Hope this helps. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I show only 1H charts, my 4H criteria has already been satisfied. This is one loser followed by a nice winner that, if left alone, would have made up easily for the loss.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Step 1, The signal line (red) needs to close above the 80 level. Once that happens, I head to 1H charts.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Moving down slowly Lets see how many pips it goes down,, have to have much patience again

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks for taking the time to post Renofaith... looks interesting.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Latest update from my EUR/AUD trade from last night. I should have set my buy limit one pip away near the small red arrow. I could've banked .5% for the day. I ditched the buy limit and set stop at BE. Let's see what gives now.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
4H stochastics still very much supporting my directional bias. I have zero wiggle room. If I sneeze, I'm stopped out. WALK AWAY at this point. I'd love to carry this one over the weekend. It's up to the market at this point.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thank you for the kind words Marty. I like stochastics to be much smoother on some of these. The good news, win # 10 for me is still out there. It may still be out there. Gonna back test some 5 min charts this weekend and 'explore' possibilities. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #42 ---
ATTN TRADERS, I'll be keeping an eye out for the NZD/USD. Stochastics is almost nearing my criteria on the 4H.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
The green for me is parity. I'd keep an eye on this one. throw on some trend lines if you like.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
This pair NU has been range bound... think SNIPER. I will not pull a trigger WITHOUT daylight on my signal line (red).

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thank you for posting this method and for the regular updates. I will be keeping a keen eye on your progression.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
SNIPER HUNGRY. TIME FOR BREAKFAST. Y'ALL BE WELL. LOL 20 minutes. Traders got your checklist up to par or are we just wingin' it? Be wise. The market don't care about your checklist and it WILL take your $$$ AND humble you.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
now tell me why you did not enter on the arrow i put?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Additional stoch parameters you are using: is it simple or exponential? is it low/high or close/close? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you so much for bringing that up. I refuse to take trades on the 1H when the 4H stochastic signal is below 80 at that time. Hope that helps. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #50 ---
smoothed hi/low. Thanks so much for bringing that up. renofaith

--- 帖子 #51 ---
NZD/USD I like what I'm seeing on the 4H.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
My trades have stopped out at zero loss. I'm very happy with what I've seen in the last couple of weeks. You all have a super duper week. renofaith

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Very nice simple setup with minimum indi and little time required. Thanks renofaith, so the SL is Swing high or low based on your chart? both Signal and Main line must cross OB or OS? Cheers and lots of pips to all Fire

--- 帖子 #54 ---
No reason why this cant work on larger time frames too. monthly/weekly; weekly/daily; daily/4hr; 4hr/1hr...A differnet time frame like weekly/1hr may have more stop outs but rewards would far outweigh the risks. Great thread!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I'll be entertaining both larger and smaller timeframes in the near future. Going live Monday. Have a great weekend everyone. renofaith

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Very nice and simple set up ... i will have an eye on ths next week... thank you for the share ... green pips to all!! Alex oops !! coudn't whait .... there is one i am in ...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Looks very nice from here. We are all here to generate pips, whatever it takes. renofaith

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yes, that pretty much sums it up. The majority of new traders have full time jobs, simplicity should allow some ease for generating pips I think.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Candle 1 is a losing trade, but the following is an option for some traders. Option 1, enter at the close of candle 2 and you have a winner. Option 2, enter at the close of candle 2 and at about 10:55 throw the fibs near the low of candle 3 and the high of the 3rd bullish candle and risk .5% on a 61 or 71% retracement.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I think h1 tf is a bit too noisy. H4 tf is providing us much more accurate signal.. So it may be better to stay in h4 tf other than those lower tfs. It is just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You avoid the noise, I search for divergence and consolidation periods. I agree with the higher time frames on all trading, but I expect to at least trade 1% of my account daily. Sometimes the 4H doesn't allow that. Trade what's comfortable with you and please continue with any opinion. It's how we all learn. I've also noticed 'this' stochastic does very well spotting divergences. Regular and hidden. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Would anyone like to see my stacker trade taken a couple of days ago? Reply to 'this' post and I will share. It's likened to a 1 Hour Sniper on steroids !!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
sure

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Sure, I would like to take a look

--- 帖子 #62 ---
My account increased 3.8% while trading this strategy in the last 8 trading days. I went from baloney and cheese to a cheeseburger !!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Would be nice to see that !!! very good results ... Alex

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Yes, pls share. Your results is encouraging. And what are the 15 pairs you are looking at? How many open trades do you have at any time?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Renofaith, Please show us some of your trade examples Thanks R

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I'm very certain there are better ways of stacking, I'll ease up a bit on the heavy blue rectangle next time. Any trader had ---17--- hours to get into this trade. I took it a step further and STACKED !! Green lines, risking pips... Blue lines, banking a portion of pips.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I always use fractals for S/R and for my fibs. Friends, you've got to think EASE every chance you get !!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Imagine seeing the trigger, wait an hour, throw the fibs on and risk that 1% at the 61% fib level. I didn't do that. I did stack multiple entries. There's your steroid my friends. ENJOY... only 1% of my capital was risked, PERIOD.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I certainly hope this helps you a bit, it's helped me. renofaith

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Just had a member ask me in private about sharing something on this thread. Personally, I don't mind. If anyone else has an issue with EXTRAS thrown in, you, as a grown adult will probably have to say something if you don't want it happening on this thread. I meant this strategy as SIMPLE. I don't clutter chart with stuff. Furthermore, once I pull a trigger on a trade, I ditch the stochastics... it's not needed after that. I also feel this is a public thread. Always with respect to all, Renofaith

--- 帖子 #71 ---
any questions at all about what I'm doing or how I'm doing it, just ask. Happy Trading to all- Renofaith

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hallo Reno, I would like to know: 1). are you using Heiken Ashi or Heiken ashi smooth? 2). What GMT is your broker? Thanks and regards, Anton

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Would you kindly show your actual trades taken so we can see your real trades rather than just vertical lines on both h4 and h1 your entries.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Post #22, on the other hand, I've only been trading this for a short time. Expect active price charts in the future. There, how's that. Hope that helps- Renofaith

--- 帖子 #75 ---
The only thing I tweaked on my HA was color. Zero settings. I like the way they give me pips though, I know you do too !! GMT- my charts are set on N.Y. (eastern) Thanks Renofaith

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Everyone can do what they want. Those charts are way too busy and cluttered for my taste. That is not a One Hour Sniper chart or trade. Good Luck with your indicator Alex, I wish you nothing but the best in your trading.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Please how do I get the type of henkinashi candle your using thanks.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Ho Reno, Thanks for your kind response. Please explain further about " I tweaked on my HA was color. Zero settings." Thanks, Anton

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I changed the colors of my candles, from red/white to green, and white. thx renotaith

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Reno, What do you mean by Zero Setting? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I meant to say color was the only thing I could change. reno

--- 帖子 #86 ---
If you want to be a successful trader, you do what they do. I have a trading checklist and a trading Constitution. The checklist should be self-explanatory. The constitution is very similar to a mission statement. I use a checklist and a Constitution. both are very personal to me. They help me keep my 'circuits' turned on. I would urge any trader to use both. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #87 ---
g'day reno. thanks for sharing ur strategy. it's very simple to understand and apply. i'll be doing some back-testing and test it on demo to gain confidence. have subscribed to ur thread for the updates/progression/tips/guidance. kind regards.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Subscribed!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Thank you very much Wisely for those kind words. I'm willing to help anyone I can. I believe no one knows what's best for everyone, but if you can pick up some information here that would help what you already do, super. The charts and information I've posted are not my creation (I wasn't a born trader), they are a culmination of so many traders sharing their work with me. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Thx and humbled by your subscription. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you very much for your interest Kaiser and always humbled. If you have a question, just ask. I'll do the best I can. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Subscribed, hope to see some trade with it..

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Would you please share your checklist and constitution? I am willing to learn from you. Thanks, Anton

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Good Morning Dragonexpert, You are as interested as I am. I discovered this on the 14th or thereabouts. I'm certain we will all come away with smiles and many pips. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Good Morning Anton, I wont show you mine personal checklist. My posts in the next 90 days will likely reflect 90% of my checklist. Also keep in mind, a checklist is of no value unless it's followed with discipline. I will get you started on both. Step 1, google it. Top forex trading checklist.... Top forex trading constitution/vision/mission statement.... 1. My daily balance is X 2. My maximum daily risk for the day is X 3. Pairs I need to watch at 08:05 are X edited 4. I have plotted any trend lines, S/R lines, and parity.... traders will need to put effort into this of course. Constitution... I will be responsible for my own actions, I will never complain when I lose, I will learn something when I lose, the market always has the upper hand. I respect the market and it's players. I will do everything in my power to generate pips (never mention money) and give back to those less fortunate than I. That should get you going. Checklists can include emotion, Constitutions dictate your future to the universe, be careful what you ask for. A constitution should be read out loud daily. Hope this helps and Sunday is the best time to get THAT out of the way. A ton of pips to all renofaith

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thank you for sharing this important part of your trading minding ... Very appreciated !! Green pips to all this week!! Alex

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Taking a moment to sincerely thank each and every one of you for your time, your interest, your questions, your opinions, your respect, and for being here. I'm a trader, not a threader, poster, teacher, mathematical genius by any stretch. I do consider myself a giver. That's why I'm here. Respectfully, Renofaith

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Good Morning Alex, I believe the words you speak are so so true. In my opinion, financial abundance is 20% mechanics (trading), 80% psychology. If your mind is not prepared for either success or failure, be prepared for the latter. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Would u share it for us Thanks a lot. Fajr

My apologies for the delay, my 15 pairs aren't anything special. EU AU NU GU UJ EJ AJ CAJ CHJ NJ ACAD GJ UCH EA EG I use Oanda for now.

Hello Solo, The way I plotted HA... insert----indicator----custom indicator----HA. Hope that helped renofaith

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Good Morning Fajr, The chart you're wanting to see is at post 27. I need to start marking them a bit better. I thought I posted a better chart. If I spot the better chart, I'll reply. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I did find the better chart back on post #69. I'm very new to stacking. That was my first stacker trade. renofaith

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Not the sexiest pair to be trading. The second trade I would have skipped. A trader doesn't even have to trade the 1H. I may not even trade the 1H on a couple of these. Enjoy the pips my friends!! Renofaith

--- 帖子 #104 ---
i was looking at the same chart at the same time i guess .... maybe a nice one this week but like you said ... not the sexiest one !!! Alex

--- 帖子 #105 ---
You may disagree with me, but I call this SWEET. I did change my vertical lines. EJ is my favorite pair. Enjoy. Yes, you can now win with forex. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #106 ---
WOW!!! very nice one for sure !!!!

Hey Alex, When you start generating LARGE pips, the only thing I would ask in return is that you help someone in need. Have a good weekend !! Renofaith

Thank you Alex for sharing that. I appreciate it. Many people need help. I've been there, BROKE. It isn't pretty. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #113 ---
That's a good looking chart Hesron, do you use fibs as well? Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi renofaith, As far as my understanding is concerned, it looks like there is no use of fractals in your trading decision. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hello Jake, I use fractals to give me ease in drawing S/R lines and plotting fibs. That's it. Thx renofaith

Thanks for your quick reply. By the way, tomorrow, I hope you can share with us pairs you are watching and let us know when you pull the trigger too

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I'm really liking what this Stochastics and HA are doing together. I'm hoping we found something great here friends. It appears as though good entries on the 1H are being made at stochastic crossovers with 'changed', 'full bodied', and 'wicked candles'. I believe that's what I'm seeing. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I can share that now. EA NJ NU. I may pull a trigger on the NZD/USD an hour after the open here in a few hours. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #120 ---
You're welcome Hesron and a big thank YOU. Renofaith

Good stuff Reno. Thanks. Are you standing in front of a Lamborghini? If so your day job must be on Wall Street... ROFL

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Thank you for the kind words Diamond. It is a Lamborghini Gallardo belonging to a friend. I currently drive a Big Truck for a living. The friend is the youngest millionaire I know. He is familiar with forex, although he simply doesn't like it. That day I did get to ride in the car and yes the car turns heads no doubt. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #124 ---
First trade of the week for me. NU4H I will add trend lines AND MAY just let this one run. The 1H trade could have been taken friday and would still be in profit as we speak. This trade boasted a 26 pip risk but it's so close to parity I'm not gonna chance it. My stop is 3 pips above the century mark. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #125 ---
What setting are you using for this indi?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Reno, I didn't mean to see your personal c-list and Const. I need the guide just like you explained below. Thanks a lot, Anton

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi i use default setting !!! I am testing also fast 5 and slow 12 Hope it helps Alex

Go to you tube and enter the following into the search bar. How To Create a Powerful Trading Routine To Improve Your Trading. I haven't watched it yet, though I will soon. It's a 12 minute video. Hope that helps everyone. Renofaith

It's a checklist Alex, document everything you do. Similar to a journal. You write down everything you think is important. I'm not good at the cut/paste thing, if someone could help him. It would be great. I don't know if baby pips has this stuff or not. Thx Renofaith

++++++++++++++++++++++ I have a friend that is a foreign car mechanic in Santa Barbara. I've ridden in many high priced cars, but the one that got the big stares was a simple 1962 Shelby Cobra. No frills, but major thrills.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Alex your stochastic settings are different than mine. Your 4H stochastic signal line is in trigger mode (above 80). My Stochastic settings are (hi/low) and smoothed.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
How is this possible ?? do you have a special stochcastic with more parameters ???6 If not can you share your template .. i am curious to know why!!! Thank you ALex

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I do not know. If you get a valid signal on your chart, it's up to you to trade. I don't know how to share templates. Have you changed any of your settings, if so go back and double check them would be my recommendation. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #139 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++ MT4 has 2 Stochastic indicators. You must be using the one from the list of all indicators. The one you want is in the "Oscillators Folder", which is above all the other indicators.

alright, gonna wait for the candle close, :-)

Hi Renofaith, here is kiwi dollar 4h i took this morning, as you mentioned, nice setup, tho one question, what is your BE policy about moving your sl after trade execution? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I give myself the options of letting in run with a 2 candle stop or take half the profit off the table either at 1:1 OR a major S/R level nearby. Thx renofaith

My stop loss was set at .7303. All my perimeters were met. I traded strictly the 4H without looking at any other timeframe. I'll take 90% wins anytime. I have two more opportunities today to trade. Being my 9th trading day with this 'system', I'm feeling very optimistic. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I did look at Investor 101's system, I will be studying his work and possibly tweaking things here. Thank you so much for sharing that. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Looks like Fire Fries may end up with a big winner. H4 and W1 stochastics look great. I hope D1 stochastics is simply retracing. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #149 ---
This afternoon, I will likely trade NJ, depending upon PA.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Higher time frame stochastics looks very nice on this one. It doesn't take long for the 4H stochastics to get where we want it.

My GJ did trigger and I decided to set up a stacker trade. TP 141.05 a few pips above the 76% fib level. Maybe, maybe not.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Greetings to all. I wanted to say I'm very flattered to see all the new traders as well as the red, brown, and yellow diamond traders here noting what's happening. Exactly what does my yellow diamond mean, anyone please?? Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Renofaith, thank you very much for your strategy sharing with us and for your participation to understand the entry and exit criteria. On the GJ map, you refer you will enter "if it triggers". Explain please, what you are expecting (in H4 stochastic is in the overbrouth zone and in H1 is already gone under 80). Also the 2 green straight lines in the map, what do they represent? Thanks in advance for your reply

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Reno sir may I ask if im getting the ideia right? Would these be valid setups? https://s29.postimg.org/ti35fwjgl/pass.png Looked first into 4H for OB/OS, then went to 1H checked if they were also OB/OS then entered on color change. With a SL placed on the last HH/LL they would all be great ITM's.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
If it triggers meant I always use a pending order and at the time, it had not triggered. I hope you're referring to my entry and stop lines. I plot those in addition to parity if it is nearby. The trade did trigger. Hope this helps. Thank you for your interest in this. I haven't traded it long at all, just a very short time. I hope you generate many pips. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Yes, that's pretty much what I'm doing. Many pips to you. I will attempt to post every trade I take. I do not pull a trigger until the 4H signal line has breached the OB/OS level(s). Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #146 ---
thank you pip boss for all that info. renofaith

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Many traders on this thread are not following this strategy. Some are. If your expectations are not met, it's because you did not follow the rules. You have been warned. This is a public thread. Most new traders do not have time to check charts every hour due to a full time job. Greetings Renofaith

--- 帖子 #148 ---
NJ is OB on 1H, 4H, and D1. I plotted fibs on the weekly, PA now near the 71% on the weekly. The CLOSE of the first red candle on the 1H, I'm in. Thx Renofaith

Trading makes me hungry. Everyone have a great day. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Alex, 2 1/2 hours ago, we were all urged to short on the GJ, now all of a sudden that's not such a good idea. I entered because MY rules were met. Others came to the thread with their flavor of the month. Please practice discipline and patience without all the knee jerk comments. I thank you and your friends in advance. Some of us will succeed in the long term because we don't just buy or sell when it looks good. Rules must be met. Thank you for reading. When you make the negative comments, it likely makes the new traders reconsider what they're doing. That's not fair. RENOFAITH

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Still in to either TP or SL. Just another trade on the road to many many more. Try to keep calm and learn to control your emotions which is important in trading.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
RULES often remind me of a country song... 'if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything".

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Yes sure !! I decided to go in the trade , so i follow the plan , TP or SL ... just always curious what people are thinking or the way they analyse their trades .. Thank you for update my friend !! Alex

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Alex, In my opinion, you did nothing wrong. This is a public forum. You seemed to have changed your mind on an important pair we've all been watching, and you seemed to do it with lots ???? of emotion. Your English is fine, I understand your words very well. Your friends aren't following the rules of this system and they communicate with you only (it appears). I'm supremely confident they will explain why they are doing things differently than the rest of us and obviously creating confusion with those of us who may not be interested in what they're doing. I don't do buddies, subscribers, followers, friends, DIAMONDS. I do trading. When someone gets in the way of my high probability trade, I find that extremely disrespectful. Please do not send me any more private messages sir. Respectfully Renofaith

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Next trade on the 1H will likely be this one. Gotta see red first though.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I think you misunerstood me sir , i am in that trade still ... and whaiting like everybody for the final result . There is no emotion in there , it's my english that doesn't go good over . But it's ok . i never been unrespectfull in anybody in 8 years of trading , i am just trying to find my way like everybody . But if i am in your way , i want to thank you for sharing your system , and i will go away . i wish tons of green pips to all.!!!! Alex

--- 帖子 #179 ---
What I've decided to add to my entry criteria, is a trend line break, and close, on at least H1, followed by a break of subject candles close. Sorry for slightly different look on chart, but TL's are easier for me to see &amp; draw accurately. I'm not trying to highjack the thread, just pointing out something you (Reno) mentioned on page 1.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Diamond, very smart decision. You likely have much more experience than I on this HA. The first video I watched mention TLB as a MUST. I don't expect to find perfection, I do expect high probability. Friends, I've been trading HA for maybe 2 weeks tops. Furthermore Diamond, please continue to share with or without charting and I for one, THANK YOU. renofaith

--- 帖子 #181 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++ OK, I will. But I must warn you, I have made mistakes before... 8• O

--- 帖子 #182 ---
No mistakes any bigger than mine I'm willing to bet. I don't know if you agree, but mistakes (to me) is when you trade against your own checklist! I don't do it anymore, but I used to. OUCH. When I trade my checklist, and lose a trade, I chalk that up to the market. It's gonna do what it wants. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Here's a EA chart showing a divergence trade I took. My entry was the grey vertical line. The trade was a winner. I failed to add a trend line. I put a trend line on this chart and plotted an arrow on the candle that CLOSED above the trend line. Thus the horizontal line should've been my entry price. Both trades, as you can see would've been profitable. Thank you Diamond- Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Please explain Hesron. That does not look like a sniper chart. What is that? Thank you- renofaith

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I only shows, that better setup for ha and stochastic with criteria but follow with increasing volume

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hesron, Thank you very much for sharing your chart. I understand most of it. It also has many wins I see. I've took notes last night of your trades and find them very noteworthy. Again, many wins I like. I may entertain this system of yours very soon. I also need to read the 'supply and demand' thread. I've been told it will help me and other traders on this thread. I've attempted to study volume and trade it, I was not successful with volume. Please continue to share, but for now I must stick to my 4H stochastic confirmation. Many Thanks and as far as I'm concerned, you are always welcome here. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I've just edited the very first post. Hope it helps everyone. Renofaith

I set a PO on the NJ. Entry is the low of the candle. This is my final trade of the day. Happy Trading everyone. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I wont be trading this, but it shows the trend line that should be broken before getting into the trade. Candle needs to close below the line and entry would be the candle low. renofaith

--- 帖子 #190 ---
hi renofaith what are the setting for the stochastic.. Kperiod: 21 slowing: 3 Dperiod: 4 OR Kperiod: 21 slowing: 4 Dperiod: 3 i'm confuse on this setting... please let me know soon as possible.. thanks...

Yen remains very weak, so I jumped on board NU again today. Arrow shows where I got in yesterday, after H1 TL break. Got stopped out like you. Lower TL is from H4. This time SL is only 16.6. Looking for 44 pips, please. Also H4 Stoch is crossing down, above 80.

Hello Victor, your first one was the accurate one. Slowing is 3. Thx Renofaith

I'm familiar with 'please', I talk to my charts often. I snagged the NJ and still hanging on to that gut wrenching GJ! Hope you do well on that one. Thx Renofaith

Attention all traders of the One Hour Sniper System, hang on to your indicators (stochastics and fractals), the rules have changed. I spent a considerable amount of time tonight reading and a few hours back testing. I am no longer confirming with the 4H time frame. All details will be presented as soon as possible. What I will share now is the back testing I did put a big smile on my face and the best part is you can trade short term or long, whichever suits your style. I will be trading both long term and short term. All entry and exit changes coming no later than the weekend. It's time to get excited. I'm very excited. Good Night to all, Renofaith

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Brand new rules. Buy signal when the 4H stochastic looks like this. Buy signal when the 1H stochastic looks like this. Buy signal when the 15m stochastic looks like this. Ensure before you buy,.... a red candle is turning green preferably with a full body with a long upper wick. Same rules apply to stops as before. You will want to close the trade with a bearish stochastic crossover (15 min.) Always go for 1:1 R/R. Plotting trend lines encouraged. The lines on the chart is ideally what you want on a 4H and 1H. When you look at a 15m chart and see 3 bearish candles in a row, be prepared, chances are you will have a valid buy entry coming very soon. Again, on the 15m chart, the blue line needs to be at least heading up, I prefer a cross but that wont always be the case. SELLING IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE Happy Trading Renofaith

Draghi rules again,SL hit on EJ trade during his talk. He can move a currency like no other

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Good morning, Thank you for updating the set of rules.... I was hoping you could confirm something for me, are we to wait for the stochastic to enter the OB/OS level on all 3 TF's before considering an entry? Or, are all TF's still a potential valid entry on their own, if we have a valid crossover? Thanks for you time.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
You're welcome Hesron and Good Morning to you. Thx Renofaith

Euro pairs have a strong fundamental engine propelling them right now. There will be sellers, but no one knows exactly where. That's where historical analysis helps us. Below is an H1 chart of ChfJpy, from Feb 2016. This is a strong resistance/supply zone. Since the Chf &amp; Eur are strongly correlated currencies, this 'may' be a location of sellers, on both Chf &amp; Eur. At some point the Jpy will gain strength, but we Never know exactly when. Also midweek, (Tuesday, Wednesday, and less often Thursday) is when we are likely to see turn arounds in price. I do have a pending order above the figure 00, however I'm not suggesting everyone pile on.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thanks for sharing reno, it has been very helpful. I followed some of your setups and they are great... just one problem I always have is, I always can't seem to get the TP level right and very often the price retraces back into a loss instead. How long do you usually hold your trades and how do you determine your TP levels?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Renofaith, Perused the thread. You have great Positivity. Thanks for the great work...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Rarely do I use a TP. I try to take pips off the 'table' at 1:1 OR VERY CLOSE TO IT. I let the rest run. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Thank you AAVEN, The thread has already improved quite a bit and thank you for the kind words. Hope you generate many pips. Renofaith

This is the only trade I've taken today. The chart shows no TP. I'm trailing my stops by the swings. I took half of my profit off the table at 1:1. renofaith

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I'll post charts on this soon... 4H blue line pointing up, 1H blue heading up, 15m stochastic crossover preferred, but if candle changes color and stochastic lines are touching, I may take the trade. I like to wait to wait on a full bodied candle with a long wick. Thx Renofaith I'm sorry, this example is for a buy only. I think everybody knew that.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hello Snipers, I took two trades today. I took one on an hourly chart not long ago. This one here was very robust all day. The thick red line-original stop. Thick blue line- took half off the trade. As you can see, I've been fortunate enough to allow this to continue running. Sometimes I set TP, sometimes I don't. Investor 101 did mention that it's sometimes it's best to close 'these' trades out when the stochastics make a cross to go counter to your trade. Hope that helps. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Reno, Thanks for creating this awesome thread. You mind if I ask what made you go long on GBPUSD? I notice the stoch is not at either extreme.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I looked at 2 other time frames, the 4H and the 1H. Both of those stochastics were heading up, that's the 'rule'. They were both bullish. I do trade extremes as well. The trigger stochastic was simply retracing and that's what is traded here. I did change the 'extreme' rules yesterday after a trader urged me to go find a thread at FF. The 15 minute stochastic was headed 'down', when it came back up, I pulled a trigger. Hope that helps. Thx renofaith

--- 帖子 #226 ---
And also Thank You for the kind words. Nearly forgot my manners. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #227 ---
This would be my 2nd trade of the day. UJ. renofaith

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I plotted both stochastics on a 1H chart to show you the difference. The top stochastic is the one we use. Look for the small red arrow to show a potential entry. You could've entered on either candle and done well. On the other hand, the other stochastic crosses to give you a full bodied candle with a nice upper wick which is what I prefer. Renofaith

Trying to understand why you entered this... isnt the stochastic on H1 overbought region now? Am I missing something else?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi Reno I have been reading almost all your thread and I am still a little confused with the Stochastic when has to be considered OB or OS referring to which TF as the leading one. Sometimes You have the 4H others 1D and some other times the Weekly as main one and scaling down to smaller one. Also I see in this chart EUR/AUD You say You are in on the 1H. I believe You went long right? this is were I get confused. to me looks like it is pretty OB I wonder if it is a little risky? Fine the D1 is coming up from OS but 4H and 1H are OB. Why did You enter the trade if these 2 lower frames are OB? Sorry just trying to understand. I am still learning and I would appreciate Your opinion. Thank You

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I will buy and sell in OB or OS, until the lines cross. I prefer to trade in no man's land, that's in between 20 and 80. renofaith

--- 帖子 #258 ---
When I trade the 1H, I'm checking the 4H and the D1. Both are equally important, but I don't worry about OB/OS on either TF. If the D1 STO is screaming buy, and the 1H is looking like a NICE retracement to go back up, I may buy if the 4H line is 'heading' up only for one candle. Risky, yes. I'm a massive risk taker. Hope this helps renofaith

Thank You I guess You are right one has to risk!

Hope no one got whipsawed during Euro tape bomb (unscheduled news event). It looks to have taken toll on all currencies, to some extent.

Here is three trades so far made on Kiwi dollar based on pure sto and heiken, first one was in profit but stopped out at be, second and third one was a bit better.

Hi Reno, Thanks for sharing/responding to everyone. Similar to yours, my journey started with different flavors of TMS/TDI, AND, similar to you (as well others), have a job/busy lifestyle and am looking to keep charts simplified....so this strategy is fitting. I've read all the posts (re-read some) and summarized your posts for myself. I have been confused at times (similar to ratsalad's posts) on your rules verses what you post. I understand there is some leeway given for any particular trader. I have to be nimble in that I CAN'T check MT4 charts at work (network firewall "thing"), but I can use TradingView charts. Also, checking every 4 hours is about all I can do until I get home, and get very discouraged when I get home and see, in retrospect, all of the potential trades I could have taken. The TradingView Stoch indicator looks/reacts just a little different than MT4 (or so it seems). It's still in the ballpark, but sometimes the gap isn't there, or the main line doesn't go as high, etc. Still, the approach is still the same. I will try to reply again with what I think your rule entries/exists are. You may wonder why I would to that when they look pretty simple: I think some of the repeated questions you're getting is self-explanatory. I have enjoyed reading your thread, the additional traders' inputs, and have adjusted my charts to do a bunch of back testing. Good trading and PIPs to ALL!

Hello lct, Thank you for your comments. The first time I saw TMS, I knew it was for me. On the other hand, I wasn't willing to read ALL those posts. I didn't everything I could to create my own TDI. This thread is only 15 pages long, and I've changed the rules already. This is what I know to be a fact, I'm keeping my STO, my fractals, and my hidden divergences. Not only is it the only leading indicator in the market, most of the time, the set up does fit the 'sniper' criteria. As far as the nimble goes, I don't have a problem trading half my normal lot size if I don't get a perfect sto crossover, or if a TL hasn't been broken. I believe you and I think in a very similar way. Please feel free to post, comment, suggest anything you think might help. Have a great holiday weekend, I've already got myself set up to trade! Renofaith

Sure hope this turns into something nice. Hidden divergence! Renofaith

I just pulled the trigger on this one off the 1H.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I think you nailed that one going long. In the beginning of your thread you started to identify direction with vertical lines/arrow. It would be helpful to the less experienced if they knew which way you were heading...just a suggestion...sometimes it's obvious, sometimes not. Will follow you on this one; predicting 40 pips for you.

LCT- This could've been yours Monday. It's still ascending. This is a D1 sto crossover, the WK is up as is the MN as well. Renofaith

hidden divergence

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi, You seem to be very good at spotting divergences no matter which frame and it works. I guess one needs a lot of watching, practice and a lot of waiting. I understand You enter the trade once there is a STO crossing right? I am trying doing the same thing, unfortunately I see the divergence always when it has already happened. Do You have any advice for trying to spot them earlier? Thank You Reno for Your Help.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
The best thing to do here is practice, How many trades do you see on EURUSD chart (mark what you would trade), and mark all divergences. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And again kiwi trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) tho, TL is broken, but we have strong supply at this level from past, will see.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I wrote this pdf. I know that this pdf can help a lot of struggling traders

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Here's what I found in your Euro chart. How'd I do?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I noticed I marked all the divergences, not just the ones that are sympatico with OHS. My bad.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
It looks like if the crossover happens before June 24, you'd take that trade for a big win. Then another crossover showing bullish divergence, hold for a big win, ignoring the hidden bullish divergence (orange lines) as we're already long. The question becomes (as it usually does) - when should we exit? The next bit of divergence I see won't be detected until March, after which this trade has soured. The hidden bearish divergence trade in September would be good for a massive pip gain, exiting at the next divergence spotted, which is bullish, ride that for a big win until the next divergence which is bearish, and missing from my markup is a hidden bullish divergence between the March 2017 troughs that would serve you well until present day. This system obviously works, although it would demand possibly more patience than I have. It also needs some clearly defined exit criteria to avoid a loss at the hands of a painfully long retrace, without taking you out of the long winning trades.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
What you may need may be on page 13, post 244. If that does NOT help, please let me know. We're gonna get 'good' at this stuff. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #297 ---
AN OPTION FOR EXIT (there are countless ways of exiting). Create 3 exits ( I only use 2). Exit 1/3 at 1:1, exit your 2nd portion at 2:1, trail your final position by the fractals. There are countless ideas on this. I googled it. Hope this helps- Renofaith

--- 帖子 #298 ---
THANK YOU very much for the pdf. I have one thing to say... clarity is power! Thx again- Renofaith

Hesron, Thanks for the stochastic indiacator. When this indicator forms arrows and when it doesn't is a mystery to me. I turned off the zone arrows as they seem to be useless, and the 'exit' arrows (actually entry arrows) are not placed at the cross, but usually a bar or more after the cross, and not all crosses are marked. Can anyone explain this? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Looks good for me, tho I don't consider valid trade if sto is in between 20 and 80, if its above 80 and turning down i'd say ok, I'm gonna look whats next (gonna go few tf lower to see where i could execute my trade, check for trend, TL, supply/demand, check if there is no big announcement on news like rates decision, etc.), nothing new, you know, this must be as simple as possible. What sto does when price is flat? I guess it counts another bunch of candles and moves on, but history price may be different from what we count in (21 candles or so), if we have lower low on price but higher low on sto, then I think market is in equilibrium where demand meets supply for a moment until one side decides it is stronger. Correct me if i'm wrong, that's how i see this.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
the arrow is when stoch main signal touch overbought/oversold 80/20 level , then the arrow appear ...... that arrow only for warning for us that stochastic is in overbought/oversold zone for the main line stochastic has change color if slope has change hope can explain thanks

May I ask, are you using TDI indicator with RSI 10 or others. Can you please share Am quite surprised to see so many divergence signals. Thank you

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I was following this thread from the beginning. But why no one posting anything on this now?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Every thread has periods with less postings. Could be a good sign. Traders do trade. Not post all the time.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Well I can say I'm busy trading and that's a very good sign Yesterday I made 207 pips on one day. Growing my LIVE account with 20%. So a pretty good day. Today is also pretty good. So far i have +72 pips. I'm monitoring EURUSD, EURCHF, EURJPY, GBPUSD, EURCAD, EURNZD, EURAUD, EURGBP and GBPJPY.

Greetings fellow traders, the following is the Loonie. It's been bearish for quite some time. The best way to participate in the move is a TC trade (trend continuation), hidden divergence is the BEST and safest way to do this. These trades were everywhere during the last week. I hope you all are finding them on your chosen TF. My posting is now being done only on weekends. Weekdays are for trading. My activity has been on the 1H, 4H, and the Daily TF. Happy trading to all. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thank you Batavia, I've been refining entries and exits and composing instructions to help new traders. I will not be on FF during the week, but during Fridays LC, I'll likely peek at any/all posts. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Same Loonie, 1H TF. a trader wouldn't even have to confirm a 4H chart on this one. I certainly hope everyone is banking great pips. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #317 ---
If the 4H Sto is ascending, I sometimes risk HALF my normal size if the 1H cross is between 80 and 20, like these. As you can see, I will be carrying these over the weekend. I watched the Daily TF before taking these trades. The rules state on this trade here the 4H stochastic needs to be ascending. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #318 ---
So far, this is a losing trade. I take all hidden divergence trades that I see. This chart also shows how I take pips off the table at a certain point. Once I take a trade, I WALK AWAY... I let the market decide for me. It's completely OUT of my hands. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #319 ---
BOTH of these trades are nothing but gravy. I will let run over the weekend. Very important to give enough wiggle room before the market closes. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #320 ---
1. Daily chart 2. Hidden Divergence, no other confirmation 3. Technically NOT a sniper trade 4. Can everyone see the hidden divergence ??

--- 帖子 #321 ---
A 1H Sniper Trade with 4H confirmation... but I risked only half because the stochastic was between the 80 and the 20. I plan to let this run for the weekend as well. My entry was WAY off, I took a huge gamble, notice where my buy 'line' is. BIG mistake on my part. It's generating pips though. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Very happy to know you are having lots of success. CONGRATULATIONS !!! Thx Renofaith

I thought I'd post my recent backtest results (done using FXBlue's trading simulator) on UJ over 4 months from April to August 2016. As long as you stay on the good side of the H4 trends the results are very good and I'll start trading this live. I'm also including the notes I took while analyzing the strategy, and my template and indicators (from Forex-Station) that I will use going forward, just in case any of this is useful to anyone in the future.

Greetings Traders, I took a trade 'last' Monday and decided to leave it alone for the week and the weekend. It's one my best trades ever. I left the sto- off of it to signify I didn't need to check it like all the others. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hello Traders, I believe in keeping it real and posting bad trades along with the good. I thought sure this trade was $$$ in the bank. I lost the trade. Option 2 on the entries, instead of entering on a close enter on the high/low of the candle. I lost 1 percent on this trade. It was a very successful trade because I followed my rules. Hope you all have a super weekend. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hello clemmo, I'm very glad to see your positive results. Upon reading the PDF, I did discover a few differences from the Sniper System. I believe the more nimble a trader can be, the more pips you'll be able to generate. $3,000. to over $20,000 in four months is impressive. That would equate to over $120,000. in less than a year. I like them odds. I do not trust your MTF Stochastics just yet, but if it works for you, that's super. All the best trades to you- Renofaith

Greetings Traders, I put heavy concentration on 2 things this last week. I made a daily note (as early as possible) the daily bias (direction) for all 15 pairs. Finally, Traded nothing but hidden divergence on the 1H, 4H, and Daily charts. Hope this helps, Renofaith

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Greetings traders, Took this hidden divergence on the UJ on the 20th. I took half the risk off at 111.15 I just plotted the heavy blue line. When I see PA doing this kind of descent, no need to check the daily chart. Although I did have it noted. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Greetings Traders, 2 items of note on this trade with the GJ. First off, I like my hidden divergence trades to be a bit more clean than this. This is also called a double top. (triple) Secondly, if you look at the buy line, I was rushed to get into the trade (remember the full time job). This trade worked out very well for me. PPPPP. ssssss. as you all can still see, a very clean chart without all the hoopla. Good Luck to all, Renofaith

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I consider this a clean setup. EA on the 1H. I did not participate in this trade. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Any trader had 6 hours to get in on this one. Greetings Renofaith

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Double Sniper Attack in 1 week. Lesson to be learned here. Just because the Daily stochastics is oversold, that does NOT mean the instrument will reverse. Remember, hidden divergence is also a trend continuation trade. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Good evening Renofaith, Its now 02:15 in Germany, so about 20:15 in your area?? I stumbled on your thread this afternoon and was so fascinated that i could not sleep! I do have to congratulate you on your way of doing things. Myself still new to the trading thing and am not qualified to give a pro meaning, but i do know that a person that is prepared to trade 9.00 lots , has to have confidence in his method! Seeing that i am retired and not depended on the income, i am trading much smaller and part time, to support a couple of social projects in Africa. ( i am originally from Namibia) I do see the potential to trade bit more aggresive by keeping to your method, instead of my picking a trade here and there. I have read a very interesting book about divergence and will study it again, to try and contribute on this thread, if i may? Being in two different time-zones , tjink we could supplement each other in a positive way. I am also corresponding with a retired pro-trader from Australia, analyses his charts 5hrs before me and i am 6hrs ahaid of you guys, could become an interesting chain? Wish you a nice evening and rest of the weekend. Glad to be aquainted. Goyatrade.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thank you so much Goyatrade for those kind words. First off, and perhaps most importantly, do not be misled by the lot size (9 lots). I'm currently trading a very large DEMO account. I do have lots of confidence in this strategy. Please share any ideas with the group that you wish. Post any charts you wish, although I think most are sticking with the same stochastic settings. I do believe in very clean charts personally. It helps me spot divergences that much quicker. Finally, I am always learning. I do not trade this for a living yet. I am preparing to do so soon. Thank you again for the kind words and ... WELCOME Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Thanks for the invite and welcome! I hope to become a positive contribution! Looking fwd to a nice friendship!

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Greetings Traders, When I look at this thread and notice there are either no or very few questions, that tells me this is a very simple strategy. This is a good strategy suited for those with a job who can't be glued to the computer all day. Most of my objectives have been met. Traders are generating pips. ... things you may not know 1. I go through baby pips once a year whether I need it or not to stay sharp. 2. I read ten pages of a good book or read 15 minutes off a trading website of some kind daily. 3. I always know my maximum risk daily before I even look for setups. 4. My daily goals are written down on a piece of paper and taped nearby. 5. I hold on to successful trades over the weekend (I currently have 3 good trades, and 1 that is in negative territory). 6. I take responsibility for my own actions, I'll never be a perfect trader. 7. My trades are good often, but the market is ALWAYS right every time. Hope this helps- Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hello Renofaith This is one of the few threads I've read from page one through to the end. I love the simplicity and your genuine helpfulness. I just wondered, have you ever looked at using Synergy APB bars (can be found here on FF) instead of HA? I find them cleaner to look at. Thanks for all your time and effort. Loftboy.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Last chart of the day for me. This BEAUTY garnered someone more double their risk and is still going. It is a Daily chart and was confirmed by the weekly chart. Any trader had 3 days to participate in this trade. The red vertical line is the entry. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hello Loftboy, The synergy name I'm not familiar with, but APB are in full use. I'm not sure how much cleaner my charts can get. I will check into the synergy idea but most likely I really don't want to fix something unless it's broken. I am very humbled and grateful for your kind words, Loftboy. I will be checking on the Synergy name. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #342 ---
You're wise not to trust it completely because it's idealized trading - using a fixed spread and assuming I'm superhuman and can be awake to trade 24/7. Also, the simulator cannot simulate the speed of market moves that happen within the smallest timeframe (in this case 1 hour) so it's doubtful I could profit from big opening moves the way I did in the simulator. Still it is enough for me to trust that the basics work and to go live with a system that is easy on my time and easy on my mind. If I leave a few pips on the table because I don't catch all the 1 hour moves, that's OK by me.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Within the next 7 days, I will create a strategy that will enlist the stochastics trading any pair on the 15 minute TF. Happy Trading Everyone. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Greetings Traders, 1H chart of the GJ. I missed a double top on this one. I certainly don't catch them all. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hello Traders, I currently have 4 trades going from last week (all yen pairs). Here is my current loser, the EJ. I slipped to the 15m to keep an eye on it. It's down about a half a percent. My objective is to leave it alone. I took the trade off the daily chart which I should have known better. If it survives, I'll be shocked. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Back to my 1H chart on the EJ. I'm really starting to trust this stochastic a lot. Got a bullish crossover on the 15m, and now we have a bullish crossover on the 1H. Daily chart is showing overbought. EJ is very well known for it's long trends. I would pull a trigger on the 1H, but I'm gonna wait until one of my trades stops out. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #347 ---
If you pull the trigger on the EJ off the 1H, WAIT for the candle close!! Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #348 ---
maybe not the best pair to trade short yen I would prefer long gbpjpy or usdjpy which have also buy signals. But are not OB in daily. S

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hello chou, For some reason, you and I disagree and I'm not sure why. I currently have 2 bearish trades going now that are GJ and UJ. I took both trades Thursday. Both pairs are in positive pips. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hello Traders, Just because an indicator shows OB/OS does not mean it will reverse. If need be, visit a 1 minute chart and spend an hour watching the behavior of the indicator. It amazed me and taught me things. The chart below is what I 'rode' for over a week. Imagine my pips if I had stacked trades. I did not stack! The highlighted area is what I participated in. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #351 ---
do you keep these positions even in OS territory?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
sorry i have just read your 2nd post

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Yes, just to clarify, I use the indicator for entries. I keep things extremely simple. Last week I traded ONLY hidden divergence trades. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Why anyone would trade anything besides hidden divergence is beyond me. Traders have to be challenged with many lines and colors and numbers. I've been there. Hidden Divergence trades are trades in the direction of the dominant trend. But, what is the dominant trend, the Daily, the Weekly? Those decision are up to the individual trader. Practice, practice, practice. I am here to share as much as I possibly can with anyone. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Im still new at spotting divergence... Can anyone help take a look at AUD USD now, on H4 I can see hidden bullish, while on Daily I see bearish divergence. Any help is appreciated!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Greetings Traders, The 4H kiwi dollar looks to be possibly running out of steam. It may look to turn bearish very soon. Always wait for the candle color change and the sto cross and the close of the candle. Thx Renofaith

Hello to all Traders, I just wanted to remind you all that the general rules I follow with regards to the stochastic are located on page 11, post 210. Happy Trading. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #358 ---
If a Daily chart is showing a Bearish sentiment, I go to a lower TF and look for a slight bullish retracement while the indicator is making a LARGE ascent (up). Go through the last few pages of this thread to see a chart that draws it out much better than I can explain it. It's somewhere AFTER page 11. Hope that helps. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #359 ---

Hi guys, watchlist: AUDCAD H4 bullish HiddenDivergence waiting for StoCross have a great day

--- 帖子 #325 ---
If you are new to divergence you can go to "babypips.com". They have a nice and easy to understand description of trading with divergence and the stoch!! Then you will understand that price movement has no restriction, where oscillators move betwee two limits, say 0 and 100?? So it often happens that the osc moves sideways, because it cannot move higher/lower, while price moves on higher/lower. That is what they then call consolidation, i think. Actually babypips.com is worth a read at least once a week, as Renofaith suggests with constant training! Quite interesting stuff! I hope this helps! Happy trading!!

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I plan to participate in this trade. The Daily stochastic is on a heavy descent. The 4H is already OS. Thx Renofaith

Here is the same chart with lines plotted.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
WAIT for the stochastic to close. Always wait. Successful traders wait for the crossover. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Concerning the above chart, stick to your rules... 1H you have a hidden divergence and a double top. 4H the sto is already crossed over. To the upside. Daily sto is on a heavy descent. G/J Stick to your rules. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Greetings Traders, I just set up triggers for a bearish stacker trade on the GJ. Max risk is 1%. This trade could gain a bunch or lose 1%.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I use fib lines on stacker trades. Stop loss is a few pips above parity. This is not a Sniper Trade. Although total risk is 1%. Renofaith

--- 帖子 #332 ---
hello, You don't care H4 sto crossing upside? S

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Yes chou, my notes include that. This is not a sniper trade. I probably should've have posted the chart, some traders trade off the Daily stochastics. I would not do this with real money. The main reason I took the trade is because I'm practicing stacking trades and there is a hidden divergence on the 1H. This trade may close out at a loss before I post this reply. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I see a daily A/J going down.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thank you glas for noticing that. I have since changed the pair. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Outstanding, you mean it will draw the trend lines on the APB and on the indicator as well? I don't believe what I just read. What a blessing. Thank you Tr3add! Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #337 ---
show us please. remember to keep it simple.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
The option for you to decide where the indicator draws trend lines is right there in the options - you can choose to have the divergences drawn on price, on the indicator or both. Not sure why the first post warranted a dislike?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hello Thread, I asking you or anyone else to post an indicator on this thread to help the new traders with the OHS. I'm not interested in attaching anything like that to my charts TODAY, although if it would help any other trader, I'm all in... with one stipulation. WE want to 'see' it on a chart as we're seeing the mq4 attachment. If you're not driven to use it on your own charts, don't expect new traders to use it. I'm reading multiple PM'S concerning this 'indicator'. I'm willing to do virtually anything to help my fellow trader/friend/neighbor. I will continue to draw TL on my own, for now. Thank You Renofaith p.s. to the traders who sent the messages, THANK YOU

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I saw Tr3add's earlier post about the Stochastic Divergence indicator (Post # 371). He had the Ex4 file but not the mq4 file needed to fine-tune the indicator to our specifications. I "Googled" the indicator, found the mq4 file on ForexFactory &amp; changed the settings to our specs - 21,3,4 Smoothed &amp; Hi/Lo price. I've attached it to this post. I also took a screenshot of the indicator attached to my H4 EUR/USD chart. The yellow &amp; green lines as well as the arrows were generated by the program. Hope this helps everyone.

Hello Traders, Would anyone like to triple their daily risk? I sure would but I was away all day and charts were not available. I'm about to show the most popular pair and I hope someone was able to participate in the action on the EU 1H. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Sometimes we as traders get in the way of our own success by overthinking instead of grabbing a #2 pencil and getting to work. I haven't checked all the charts for the day, but I'd be willing to bet this was not the only opportunity. A 1% risk would have given any trader (including myself) about a 3% reward thanks to hidden divergence. We have much work to do, let's all stay after it and generate massive pips. Today around noon (NYC), the market told you what was being planned. I totally missed it. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Greetings Traders, At midnight, this 4H GJ will likely be a valid trade. Instead of pulling the trigger now, I set a pending order for the low of the current candle. I will be asleep at midnight. Did anyone catch the other GIFT of hidden divergence on the exact same chart that happened last week? The current Daily chart of GJ looks like a possible reversal but the direction is descending, I hope it's a 2 day retracement. I may find out in the morning. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #388 ---
The weekly chart shows the real intentions of this pair. That hidden divergence is very week &amp; not to be trusted. Playing divergence is chancy at any time.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Please read the posts before telling new traders the awful things about divergence trading. Divergence trading is not chancy. Please enjoy your longer term weekly chart and leave us to our shorter term hourly charts. You should be ashamed of yourself Ralfee. For your learning information, please answer the following... how many daily bars does it take to make up a weekly bar? Have a great weekend Ralfee Renofaith

Hello. Just found this on ChfJpy H4. Regular Bullish Divergence. I've already entered based on H1. Also in order to get in cheap. A 395p drop with little pull back. My stop is 20, 5p below today's low. Update: Even though I was expecting a much greater retrace, I put my TP @ 114.38 because of it being time to sleep. Good thing too, as price made it up to 144.44, before it came all the way back down, and would have hit my SL.

@forex girl -why not? If you have the patience to watch the chart closely most of the day. I'm letting this EURNZD trade run over the weekend as the stoch tells me it has further to fall. You always need to be cautious trading against the longer trend but the daily chart tells me this should get down to at least 1.57 (prior resistance level). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #417 ---
OK. Thank you.

Hi Folks, Really like this strategy; simple &amp; straightforward. I do have one fundamental question that has always bugged me regardless of strategy &amp; wondered if I could get someone to explain it. It has to do with looking at higher TFs and then moving to a lower one to find entry points. Scenario: When looking at the 4H chart, you mark a closed candle that you're interested in with a vertical line because it has met a certain set of rules (e.g. Stochastic has reached 80, crossing over, etc). On my charts, let's say, it says it is the 0700 candle. Because it is closed, the time is now actually 1100. Because it now meets the rules, we are told to now go to the 1H chart and look for the same Stochastic or Price action movement (Page 1 of this thread). On the 1H chart, that same vertical line still sits at the same 0700 and you see that the Stochastic move that you were supposed to look for has already taken place in this 4 hour timeframe and often the price action also. How do you reconcile this in your approach? Are we to look for yet another move on the 1H to the 80 or the crossover or whatever the rule set is? It appears at first glance that the opportunity that the 4H presented to us has passed, or am I looking at this wrong? If I could get this straightened out in my head, I'm sure it will greatly improve my trading. Thanks in advance!

Renofaith- This is such an interesting way of trading. Also seems pretty simple. I am going to read all posts on this thread to understand this better. Thanks for sharing your idea.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
How do you get such nice pretty HA candles? Mine looks like crap! Is there a setting or a custom indicator to get those?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
That's pretty much how I intend to tweak my lower time frame strategy. I love to stare at price charts. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #424 ---
I let most of my trades run over the weekend. Please share your results with the thread if you don't mind. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Greetings Traders, What I love about these particular charts is I rarely have to go back to the Daily (in this case) to check the stochastics. I know by looking at this chart it's either descending or oversold. I haven't turned on a price chart in 2 days. This one is currently up just over 2% which is just fine by me. This is one of the nicer MOVES that I spotted immediately. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I have many issues with experienced traders teaching MTF to younger traders. Trade off the 4H after looking at the Daily... the obvious question here is how many 4H candles make up a Daily? You and I share the same sentiment on this. MY CONCLUSION is simple- 1. find something simple that works for you. 2. test the H### out of it without getting analysis paralysis. 3. put as many odds as you can in your favor. (for many it is MTF) **** 4. if hidden divergence is SAID to be the only 'leading indicator' in forex, why doesn't everybody just do that? The answer to that is we love to complicate 'stuff' for no good reason (I'm so guilty). I'm confident something in this reply will help. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Greetings Traders, I wanted to take a brief moment to thank each and every one of you for everything you may have added to this thread. Thank you for your comments, replies, awesome charts, winning attitudes and anything I may be forgetting. I owe you all a large debt of gratitude. I'm sharing what I can. I'm learning just as many of you are. I'm very proud of all of you. Work has had me away for a couple of days, but I think if a trader were to tweak this to their style or liking, the possibilities could be virtually limitless. It's my plan to be trading full time in a couple years. This will be one of my few strategies I fully intend to enlist. Happy Trading to all Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #428 ---
This is another one of those knee jerk trades that even after studying my terminal, I simply do not know which TF I was basing the entry off of. Hope someone caught this bullish move, perhaps someone who follows the 'rules'. I do need to adjust my stop. It is nice to open up the laptop after a day or two of no trading and find your balance is up a robust 3% in your absence. Thx Renofaith p.s. I did pull the trigger on the 2nd FYI

--- 帖子 #429 ---
CAUTION TRADERS I'm not gonna mention any names, but please double check your stochastic settings before trading. Some charts are showing 21.3.4 while others are showing 21.4.3. I'm honestly not sure what impact that could have on your entries. If you're unsure, check my charts that I post. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #430 ---
This question has me curious early. TRY the 8.3.3. This is after looking at a 15m, then a 5m. Best of luck to you. Thx Renofaith p.s. I would look for hidden divergence first, it greatly increases the odds- backtest, backtest, backtest

--- 帖子 #431 ---
This is doable folks on the 15 minute TF. This is not the sexiest pair to trade, but... 1. the first red vertical line is taken off the 4H coming 'out of O/B territory'. 2. this is a 15m chart 3. this is hidden divergence. 4. notice the small red arrow, it notes a fractal (a high), I'd be making notes of this, I like to pull triggers with highs and lows 'next' to each other, but as traders, we know there is always risk. 5. I would have pulled the trigger on this mostly because (1) the 800 lb gorilla (London) had gone home, and (2) N.Y. had gone home as well. 6. If the noted fractal was not there, I would've pulled the trigger, regardless. 7. I did not participate in this event, I simply wanted to show what was possible with OUR stochastic on a much lower TF. Good Luck to all Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #432 ---
The us yen was screaming come get me for hours just this morning. This trade should've netting a trader more than double your risk. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #433 ---
A trader should've pulled the trigger on this 4H chart either Monday morning OR evening with a pending order. This descent would have had you up 'over' 3X your risk my friends. Hidden Divergence is how I plan to fire my boss... Thx Renofaith p.s. Daily stochastic is screaming sell me!

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Renofaith These rules are so simple to follow. I am looking at the USDCAD chart right now on 4H. It shows that the signal line is above 80. I then looked at H1 and I already see change in color candle. Is this perfect example to short this? Do I wait for the H1 candle to close at 9pm New York time?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Concerning the above chart... I certainly hope everyone was able to catch the 'other' hidden divergence trade, same pair, same chart, same week. The trigger would've been pulled 'last week', around the 2nd of August. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Your stochastics are not the same settings as ours. When you change your settings, you will see the 1H stochastic has NOT crossed over. Hold off for now on that trade. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Stochastic settings need to be at 21,4,3, not 21, 3, 4.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Thanks for pointing this out. I have changed it now. I noticed the crossover have not happened but I see change in the color of the last 1 hour candle.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Yalgaar, Your charts looks very clean and easy to read. I would draw a trend line on your 1H chart and wait for a red candle to close below it, that decision is yours. I would wait for the red candle AND the stochastic crossover. I likely need to edit that post. I would definitely wait on both to happen. Hope this helps. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Let me know how your trade pans out, the price looks like it's due to come down any time now. I may have to adjust my stop on my end. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Thank you Renofaith. I am just trying to understand your rules. Seems like both has occurred now after the 1H candle close. The last candle is Red (new color change) and I also see the crossover in stochastic. I will sure keep in mind about "both" going forward. Thanks for taking your time and effort to explain.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Following are the rules I found in 1 of your post that I was trying to follow and learn. I believe the point number 4 is "AND" instead of "OR" Do you recommend any other changes? This is kinda how I do it. 1. Scan 15 pairs ever 4 hours looking for the SIGNAL line to close above/below the 80/20. 2. Identify the pairs (write them down). 3. Pull up the hourly charts and wait for a stochastic crossover or AND a change in candle color. 4. There is your entry friends. 5. Exits, worse case scenario 1:1. There will be losing trades, I've spotted them, although I have not participated in any yet. This is forex. It probably wouldn't hurt to monitor news events. I don't. I wont. You can!!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I just noticed my stochastic does not match with what I see in your chart even after correcting what you pointed out. Is there anything else I might have incorrect. I am attaching my settings here.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Not the prettiest set up on the cable, but I'll be happy if it survives the weekend. Goodnight everyone. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Your numbers are correct, my other settings include (high/low) instead of closed, and the (smoothed) instead of exponential. I probably should've mentioned that. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Thanks for confirming. How do you decide your TP and SL on these trades?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yalgaar, you trade a bit differently than I do. In your case, set your stop at the nearest high or low (fractal). TP should always be at least 1:1. Rarely do I set a profit target and sometimes that bites me, sometimes I get a good trade that runs. I always trail my stop, if I see price has moved in my direction and I'm going to be away, I'll protect a portion of my profits. I always give my trades plenty of wiggle room. Hope that helps... ALWAYS USE A STOP Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #448 ---
That looks very good to me, I would definitely wait on both to occur, the stochastic cross and the change in candle color. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I'll help anyone as much as I can. On my stochastic, I deliberately made one line thick and one line thin to help me with fakeouts. When my stochastic makes the 'cross', I look for daylight between the lines. I believe it's my signal that I made thick because it gives me ease in plotting my trend lines and helps me with detection of a setup at times. Hope that helps- Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Dear Renofaith, thank you for this very very well done entry strategy. What else do you pay attention beside using this analysis? Maybe like news, volatility, candle stick formation etc? Thank you

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I guess I have found my answer Cheers mate

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Thanks Reno for sharing this method - didnt manage to get on any of the good trades that started since last week, hopefully next week will be more exciting..

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Second attempt on this pair. The first trade I had to exit according to my rules (first contrary bar that closes on H4) but it was painless and this entry has the added benefit of clear divergence (bearish). So I see: - bearish divergence on H4 (yellow dotted lines) - A crossover signal - my first red candle that cuts across a trendline (lightSkyBlue) That's an entry, so I will babysit this for a few hours, and if all is well I will get a good night's rest then stay in this trade until a green candle forms and closes on H4.

Thank you for the kind words yousername--

--- 帖子 #455 ---
There are always plenty of good opportunities, the best opportunities are worth waiting for. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #456 ---
This should be display at the front page "I refuse to take trades on the 1H when the 4H stochastic signal is below 80 at that time."

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi renofaith, you did mention that at least 2 times since the start of your thread. I like the stochastic oscillator and up till now i have always used the 9,3,3 Am interested to c how this one performs. Nice strategy and tnx for sharing!

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Watching this one next week..... I realize the H4 is not oversold , but am hoping for a continuation trade ...

--- 帖子 #459 ---
What about the usd/cad, it is near OS on the H4 and already OS on the H1 and i see a support level.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Maybe this support, at the blue arrows is the new support level. It lines up perfectly with the 23.6 fibonacci and could be a good point of entry.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Renofaith Doing some back charting on this over the weekend. Looks decent might experiment with this over the next few weeks. My first post on here, I watch with great interest.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi Reno &amp; all readers of this thread...I've been a daily follower of this thread, but typically don't post...sometimes ask questions for clarification. I'm trying to understand and develop my own approach, have tested what's been given. So, I guess I'll go out on a limb here and start to post my approach and results. Please provide any corrections to my thought process or "trigger pulling" based on this strategy. Soooo, for next week, this is what I've got: 1. I checked the Daily charts for all 28 common pairs for Stochastic OB/OS condition; if there was a pair in either condition, I noted it on my checklist. 2. Went to the 4H charts of each of the previously identified pair to see where the Stochastic indicator was (according to Reno's 80/20 rules) a. if the 4H Stoch slope was headed in the same direction as the Daily and I just had to wait for it to arrive to coincide with the Daily, I marked it a "watch" pair. b. if the 4H Stoch slope was completely out of whack with the Daily, it was a "No Trade". c. if the 4H Stoch was in alignment (or close to it), I'm considering that a viable trade. 3. For those that are tradeable this week, I further qualified them with other parameters: a. Near a S/R zone b. I've placed a 20 SMA indicator on my charts to get further idea on direction and its potential strength. So, where is the price action compared to it? Far away, it could be coming back. Close or multiple candles are staying close by...maybe I'll let that one go, but still watch it. c. News....any RED news coming that might influence (compound??) its future direction, or whipsaw. Results: CAD/JPY - O/S; EUR/AUD - O/B; EUR/CAD - O/B; EUR/NZD - O/B; GBP/JPY - O/S; NZD/JPY - O/S I feel pretty good about the vetting process, and will watch only the 4H charts. I'll trade on a demo account to see whether this homework has worked out.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hope this is accurate, hidden divergence on H1, but not completely formed on H4 for NZDJPY.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Greetings Ace, I shared the settings multiple times, unfortunately post #1 had it wrong. I just added some key information to post number one. My apologies to all. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Greetings LC, I hope you're not trying to do this perfect. Keep this stuff simple my friend. If the Daily stochastics is 'descending', look for a 'bearish' stochastic cross on a lower TF. If the lower TF stochastics is 'erratic', either find another TF or a different pair. Double check stochastic to ensure it is 'smoothed'. Hope this helps Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Greetings yann, minus the 20 sma, that is a FANTASTIC look at a hidden divergence trade. I wait for a 'complete' cross of the stochastic along with a candle color change on the trigger TF (1H) This is the reason I shy away from any moving average lines... many of my HD trades include dbl and triple tops/bottoms. These trades can be very successful, but if you have a MA plotted, it will be mostly flat. Don't let the MA prevent you from generating pips. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Reno...thanks for the accountability. Of course I'm trying to be perfect...hahaha...that's my nature. I fight it every day; it leads to all kinds of bad trading behavior. So, with this approach (only checking every 4 hours) I'm hoping it will slow me down and be more intentional rather than being anxious and pulling the trigger too early (a very bad habit that keeps me in trades too long,waiting for the move to happen). Today, I made an initial check of the charts from yesterday's homework...nothing outrageous, so I'll check back in 2.5 hrs to see what has happened. I've read where other traders don't trade Sundays, and some not even Mondays..watching what &amp; where the institutional $$ will drive the market for the week. That will require more patience for me, not a bad thing. I'm expecting to get up early Monday morning to see if any of the pairs are ready to be traded and we'll see where the market takes us.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Many of our 'yen' pairs are showing bearish continuation. If I see HD on the 4H, I head to the 1H, wait for the 'cross' and the color change. I do not wait for the cross on the 4H to trade the 1H. Read that sentence again! Notice the shaded rectangle on this. The thick green horizontal line on the stochastics is exactly what I look for on the 'trigger' TF. When the black thick signal ascended above that line, I mark it on my checklist and head to the lower TF to wait on a crossover and a change in candle color. This is a 4H chart. I can trade this TF in addition to the 1H if all my criteria is met. This pair is on my checklist at the moment. Hope this helps Thx Renofaith

good hidden diverngenc n the price go down

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Thanks for the clarification about my post earlier, and also this explanation. Was planning to ask if you need to wait for a 4H cross before diving into a 1H trade but by then the trade might've left without you. Also to highlight the importance of waiting for a convincing change in colour of the bars, this we can see from the screenshot that the divergence trade is not a GO yet.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I think I may take a stab at this pair a bit later. G/J has always been kind to me. The U/J and N/J are also making similar movements.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Here's the same pair on a 4H. I'm putting all the odds in my favor that I can. No trades on either TF until I see a red candle and a complete cross. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #476 ---
No, I do not wait for the 4H sto to cross if I'm pulling a trigger on the 1H hidden divergence trade. In addition, if you wait for a full bodied 1H candle to close, your 4H signal line will hopefully have begun to create a 'hook' in your desired direction. Many traders also plot trend lines on those 1H charts for added confirmation. It's good that you brought all that up. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks for the 1H tweak Reno, Actual Trade - 1H short on N/J late last night (for me anyway). currently +21 pips &amp; still in it. Fib (if I drew it correctly) shows a potential +62 at the 61.8 level. I'm still in it..we'll see where it leads today. Tracking my other "watched" pairs from Saturday's homework - C/J is +20; E/C would be a "NO TRADE" due to 1H signal never breaching 80; E/N would be "NO TRADE" due to HUGE wicks; G/J would be +40 within a few hours yesterday and +60 if you held on, and U/J would have been +40.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
hello, no more activity here?

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Reno, I read each and every post, thanks for the great system. One query though. Initially the rules were: 1. Scan 15 pairs ever 4 hours looking for the SIGNAL line to close above/below the 80/20. 2. Identify the pairs (write them down). 3. Pull up the hourly charts and wait for a stochastic crossover AND a change in candle color. 4. There is your entry friends. 5. Exits, worse case scenario 1:1. But in one of the posts you announced some new rules , where you showed a image of Stoch for an entry criterea, and also talked about the 15 min charts. which set of them do you propose us to use. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Posting this as a gift to the thread. It's a stochastic oscillator indicator where you can adjust the 80/20 levels. It shows signals on the chart window and on the indi sub-window (adjustable size and color) but only signals that are on the correct side of the 80/20 levels (i.e. buy sell above 80, and sell buy below 20) will show up on the chart or generate alerts. This cuts down on the large number of useless alerts that ordinary stoch generates. It's also mtf so you can get signals on H4 while watching price on H1 for example. I have to say after looking at the stoch with only valid signals that my confidence in this indicator's usefulness is a little bit diminished. It just isn't as versatile as W%R, for example, even though they are closely related, formula-wise.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
One more thing. Since this indi doesn't do a good job of clearing up its arrows when you switch TF, here's a script that will delete all objects from your chart. Just run the script, right-click the chart, refresh, and you're back in business.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Please confirm that this is indeed what you had in mind: "(i.e. buy above 80, and sell below 20)" Thanks

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi, I find your strategy really interesting. Could someone help me with this images? I spot this chart but i think it's too late to enter in a short position. What do you think? Thanks

--- 帖子 #486 ---

Greetings friends, we all know divergence trades can be found on all TF. I've spent the better part of 18 months of digging to improve on what I've learned about following the trend. I have changed the sto settings I used to use, I've eliminated some indicators. I don't use MTF anything. I simply trade what I see. I currently trade the 1H and 4H, I dabble the 1 minute when I have time. I have added a couple of indicators. However, I do feel it worth mentioning here that the heiken ashi is my friend, along with the trend of course. I now use the 833 sto for my divergences, all of them. I've used this alone and I believe it can be done, however I found an indicator combination that has allowed me to not only 'wait', but at times walk away from LOSING MONEY. This combination indicator is the RSI (14) combined in the same window as a 14 EMA/ Previous indicator data. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I've added the 34 EMA to help me with trend direction on the 1 minute. NOTE the (2) green vertical lines indicating possible entries. Either entry would have made me good pips, if you plot and use the rsi/ ma indicator at the bottom, you will avoid entering bad trades. I enter only on the RSI/EMA cross. Enjoy, Thx Renofaith The trade you see is actually based on the 4H, you can disregard. I did have a good week.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Did you all catch the NEXT hidden divergence that I did NOT mark? Hello friends, I have it marked on this chart, with a green vertical line. NOTE the RSI/EMA crossed 'quickly', the way we want. If you trade divergences, I would NOT trade without a confirmation of the rsi/ema cross. I trade a live account now. Not every trade will win. Best of luck to you all. Thx Renofaith

Again, I have added a 34 EMA. It helps me determine trend. If it clutters your charts, leave it off. This is not my creation, I have combined knowledge from a number of successful traders. I don't like clutter, you'd never know that looking at my charts. Your charts need to make you happy. The charts I post is what I use 'most' of the time. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #491 ---
VERY IMPORTANT HELP..... As far as trading live, I'm not here to brag. I'm here to help if I can. My money balance will never be shown. It's none of anyone's business. Question for you all, should I mark out my lots? It doesn't bother me posting it. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I did not participate in this trade. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #493 ---
5 minute chart. Note I would've entered on the 2nd red candle. The trade would've been 'just fine'. the 2nd red candle included the RSI/EMA cross. Also note the 'great difference' in contrast on the stochastic. That's what I look for. Enjoy friends Renofaith

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Any trader would have smiled at the Loonie this week H4. If you have patience, this would have been a nice trade. Thx Renofaith pardon me, last week.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Good 15 minute chart on the Yen. Price below the 34 ema. Very good contrast on the 833, and I pull the trigger 'only' after the RSI/EMA cross. I did not participate, however as you might notice, this was a set-up on a higher TF. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Friends, this post is all about keeping it real. Same pair, same TF, same rules, losing trade. Did anyone notice the regular divergence between the winning trade and the loser? I did not mark it. Food for thought. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Love trading divergence. Everyone have a fantastic weekend. Keep it real. Thx Renofaith

--- 帖子 #498 ---
A gift from above. Regular divergence showing price likely to head down. In addition, hidden divergence showing a trend continuation. The trade would have still been active, likely 2R (two times the risk). I'll take that any day. I do trade NYClose charts. Hope that didn't mess anybody up. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #499 ---
5 minute TF. I would not have taken this. Price gets a bit too close to my SL. Price is on the wrong side of the 34 EMA. For the 5 minute chart, there are so many opportunities. This trade would have worked. I really like the stochastic set up here. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #500 ---
The entry on this hidden divergence trade happened on a close below the 34 EMA. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Take profit. If you find one of my charts, you'll see I take money off the table at certain times if my lot size will allow it. I have no formula for this. I manually trail my stops which you should see on my Aud/Jpy trade. I often follow fractals when trailing my stop. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Scalpers Ahoy! Rarely do I trade the 1m. This trade I would've taken. Enjoy, Reno

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Total of 3 good trending trade opportunities on the 1m chart. Why would any trader not use the only 'leading' indicator for the markets. If you're trading regular divergence, plot and trade based on the price closing above/below the trend line. Hope some of this helps. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I risk no more than 1% on HD and no more than .5% on RG. thx Reno

--- 帖子 #505 ---
My favorite TF. Here are 2 easy HD trades back to back. Set the alarm for midnight. Trading the Euro on the hourly chart. Price above EMA Stochastics was spot on. RSI/EMA cross was as needed. A trader should have been thrilled with 3R on this day, possibly a bit more. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Why is this trader waiting on a silly RSI/EMA cross? The following is a chart that shows why. Pulling the trigger on red candle 1 would have cost. Pulling the trigger on candle 2 would have brought a smile. Now, look for the cross. In the 2nd example, (same chart) I have another HD divergence marked. While most traders are waiting for price to 'tank' (in this example), the indicators are 'clearly' showing you with a 'regular divergence' to cover your trade. How many of you would have got nailed. Probably me. I've been trading divergence for a little while, the market 'surprises me too'!!

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Nothing like a couple of simple indicators to tell me price will 'continue' in a particular direction. 1H is my favorite TF. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I do hold my trades over the weekend. I currently have 3 open trades. I also trade around holidays. This is my account, I trade it as I wish. We all know something could happen over the weekend, I could lose my money. Getting out of bed is a risk. We all risk differently. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #509 ---
2 of my favorite pairs to trade during the holidays are GJ and EJ.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Are you still using High/Low and Smoothed for the Stochastic? Thanks

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I have mine set on Hi/Low and simple. Using the smoothed would likely be fine. I've missed a number of opportunities with other indicators. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I posted this chart to show what I look for on my stochastics. Regardless which line I use to plot my trend line, I like to see a big difference between any high or low on my stochastic. I prefer 30 units difference between the two points. If I glance to see a high at 80, I'm gonna be more apt to set up my pending order if my lower touchpoint is really close or below 50. And of course, vice versa. It's a SNIPER move I use. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Big swings in the stochastics for me to consider trading. It's your money. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I absolutely would've taken this. 5 min ChJ HD RD Wait for the RSI/EMA cross. Beware the spread on these crosses.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Friends, this is not the Holy Grail. I like this strategy a lot. This trade I definitely would've taken, I would've lost. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I'd like to wish all of you a wonderful Christmas and a blessed New Year. Remember Jesus is the reason for the season. Regards Reno

--- 帖子 #517 ---
While watching the higher TF, watch for a hook in the stochastics. Also keep an eye on the HA candles on the lower TF, all candles give clues. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I have gone back to more common settings and I've added an RSI/EMA indicator. This will work on any TF. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Settings update I began using the stochastics indicator with the following settings 21, 4, 3... hi/lo... smoothed. At one time, this is all I had for indicators. I was/am thrilled with the divergence trades I'm able to find and trade. The other option I gave myself was going back to a more common stochastic setting of 8, 3, 3 same variables. I had to find another indicator to filter false moves. this additional indicator is the RSI(14)/14 EMA combination. Either of these indicators will harvest good pips and do it often. They perform the same. If you want cleaner charts, use only the 21, 4, 3 stochastics. I will leave both templates and check my setup against both. I'm very happy with the thread here. I certainly hope someone is benefitting from this information. I still look for OB/OS stochastics as well on the larger TF. Best wishes and Happy Trading Reno

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Same pair, same Hourly chart. One is showing HD, one is not. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Noticed this HD on the fancy 1min chart. Does anyone see the HD setup going the other way? LOL

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Friends, if you had a template of the 21, 4, 3 and you also had a template of the 8, 3, 3; would you even have considered this NICE looking trade on the above chart? Both are showing a TC clearly to the downside, however only one of them is showing a reversal to the bullish side. Aren't we all glad to have the advantage of 1 minute charts? Thx Reno

Greetings Traders, keeping an eye out for this pair. Stochastic on the higher TF is well over 80. Happy Trading Reno

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Despite slow movements, I was able to take some risk off a trade. I began this trade with .05 lots, I took .03 off at .85. It's all gravy from here on out. I may add a position at .80. Thx Reno

Questions worth noting for my progress. What must I do to be ready for the next 20 days of trading? What book on trading or personal development am I currently reading and what book is next? What 5 people am I hanging out with the most, are they a good influence on me, is that ok? What are my daily goals in pips, weekly, monthly? Is my internet bill paid up? Do I have a trading checklist? Is it being followed? Does it need to be tweaked? Do I have distractions while trading? Is that ok? Do I note high impact news events? Is that affecting my trading? Do I have a Constitution for my trading and is it in writing and do I recite it daily? Am I on track for the next 12 months of forex trading? What must happen to put me on the track I wish to be on? What are things I can be doing to keep me on track? What things am I doing to build my personal patience, confidence, discipline, FAITH and other character traits that would get me where I want in my trading endeavors? When will I be financially independent? What must happen to get me there? Who can help me get there? Can I do this alone or do I need help? Friends, I believe the right questions can give us power and direction. I also believe crappy questions do the opposite. Merry Christmas to all my fellow traders. Regards Reno

Hi Renofaith, i just stumbled on the thread today, i have read the first page, and i would like to commend you for a great job. I'm still new to forex because i have not gotten enough time for it. I know you have added some other features to the system, but i would like to know if the original system from first page is enough to trade profitably

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Thank you for the kind words dele5000. Everyone at some point is new at forex. I was new at one time. In answer to your question, you can use the information on page 1 to generate pips. I love the strategy. I still trade the 1H, 4H, and other time frames. I have made a strong shift to Divergence trading. This is also mentioned on page 1. Welcome to the thread, I wish you the best. Please do not hesitate to ask any question. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Just cleaned up page 1 with an edit. Less hoopla. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I did add a 34 EMA to my charts

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Know that I use NY close charts. Your times may not be the same as mine. If you glance at my charts, know what you're looking at. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Looking at the above chart, I added the 34 ema to show the strength of the downtrend. Did anyone spot the Hidden Divergence setup near the text HA? I don't pull a trigger until the stochastics cross and the RSI crosses below the MA in the bottom window. Both must happen. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hello sir, thank you so much for your thread, i'm trying to read all the topic, and may i know the success rate of the strategy ? Thank you again Sorry for my english Merciii

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi Mr renofaith I am new to you thread and just got the time to read these 20 something pages,thank you so much I will follow rules and apply.....I really like thissystem how simple it can be with trading and not cluttering the chart with many indis :-)

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thank you so much for the kind words scsstnt, I like to keep things simple when possible. I'll help you with any question you may have. If I don't have the answer, I will find the right answer. Although the 1H chart is my favorite, these trades happen on 'all' TF. It's also very helpful to review all information at babypips when you have spare time. I go through the courses every year just to keep it in my memory. Babypips is where I started. Wishing you nothing but the best. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I generally wait an hour after the market opens, the spread gets much more affordable. Enjoy, Reno

--- 帖子 #548 ---
10 pip spread, no thanks! I wait.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Wow....amazing....I read about hidden divergence before but you application on the chats are beautiful....thank you so much this is definitely the best xmas present :-) for any trader.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Well, thank you again for the kind words. I used to trade all kinds of lines before. I don't know why any trader who wants pips wouldn't trade this now. I know what you wanted for X-mas, LOL Best Regards, Reno p.s. the spreads are getting better now too! Happy Trading scsstnt!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
The spread is fine now, but don't get caught in the trap. Price may be reversing. Checking more TF and maybe just waiting for price to make a move.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
1H and 4H oversold below 20 I'm seeing here

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Selling the EJ 15m. Risking .5R at 125.67. SL is at parity (126). Letting any profits run. Do not risk more than you can afford. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Can you explain why you selling at that price?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
That was fun!! EJ closed 'above' trend line on the 15m. Allowed me to negate my trade. Hope everything worked out for all of you. Sometimes (in my case, success comes with no trade, no risk). Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Yes, that's where the first candle of this session closed at. There was a gap at the opening bell, a large price drop. The spreads are always higher at opening bell too. The first hour or so of trading the 'gap' often tightens (it did), but then the price would often return to the bearish move, which it did not. The stochastics was showing a divergence; a move back to the upside. If you did not understand that please let me know. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #557 ---
The text I entered is incorrect, it says the second green line should be the entry for the regular divergence trade, which is doing well I think. The smartest entry would be the candle that 'closed' above the trend line, not the 2nd green line. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Its perfect i understand now I made a previous error about price being below 20 when it was above on 1H and crossed showing diversion as you said. Yes everything says buy.....good that you have a pending order,not activated. Im looking for hidden and normal visible diversion on other pairs,i still list your 15 that you trade,i think its enough for me to practice. 15m - 1h and 4h will concentrate on and also notice how the price behaves on all TF below and above 20/80 levels....thank you for that really good explanation.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
You've done some homework... super. Thank goodness for PO is all I can say. I'll post a pair or a chart if I can get to it quickly enough with trading opportunities. If you have time, check out the EUR/CHF 30min. You may have to use a line chart to see the HD. Best of luck to ya, and I love some Def Leppard!! Good Stuff!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Maybe an opportunity soon here. EUR/CHF on the 30m

--- 帖子 #561 ---
There was a RD setup on the 4H. Great call.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Pardon me WayneLeye, I nearly missed your post. You've asked the toughest question tonight. This is the best answer I can give you now. I have 4 open trades 1st is at BE 2nd is up .5R 3rd is up 1R 4th open trade is up 7R (7 times my risk) Hope that helps Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Rarely do I use TP. I let my trades run. Most of the time, I use a manual stop, normally at fractal highs/lows. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #570 ---
On the EUR/CHF, we may get stopped out within the hour. I don't mind a losing trade as long as the rules were followed. It gave me a chance to catch a nap. The coffee's hot. Nice looking charts scsstnt. Good morning to all. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #571 ---
USDJPY H1 giving us a possible hint of nice things to come. Beware the RD's at the same time. Caution with some of these setups. Happy pips to all. Reno

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Pivot points, not a bad idea at all. I don't plot them because I'd be too tempted to use TP. However PP would be a good level to take R off the table and re enter. Reno

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Very grateful my AJ just got stopped out. I employed 2 positions. 1 lost a fraction of a percent, the 'runner' lasted for days and gave me a whopping 7R. Very grateful. Reno

--- 帖子 #574 ---
My only other entry is on the UJ 111.26, it's up 1R, with a SL at BE. It's up to the market at this point. It is however signaling a possible HD trade. I plan to leave it alone. Go Bears! Reno

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Thank you Ren...i try to keep a color scheme .... :-) i need coffee now as well,rules always important im fine losing sometimes as long as i stick to it

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Took an HD trade ((from my phone)). I'll get better at this. 1H GJ, it's likely to spit and sputter most of the day. My entry was spot on, I did adjust my stop to 140.51. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Good afternoon Nice strategy. I would like to ask, how do you add 14 EMA on the RSI?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
When it comes to HD, rarely do I go to various TF for data. However I caught the 4H setting up for a possible HD. Trade 1 is a super star, 2 and 3... not quite yet. We may get the RSI cross, maybe not. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Ok friends, the above chart does have a valid setup. It's your decision to take the trade. I prefer a bit of daylight on my RSI cross. I have had success with trading dbl top HD. Maybe I'm getting spoiled on the 'stair step' formations. I'm gonna sit this one out. Risk is roughly 26 pips or so. Any feedback certainly welcome. There will be more opportunities. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Stair step would be trades 1 and 2 from last chart, not trade 3!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I totally agree im seeing more of a bounce not between RSI 14 and EMA14 ,cross confirmation is really a good man - so quiet as banks closed now,but still the market is making some decent moves but nothing like UK/US overlap that we so like seeing :-)

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Friends, this is not something I do often. I focus on higher TF. The following is a 5 min chart of the CADJPY. My account can afford the .5R that I've put on it. I did say this works on all TF. Also note, I've taken 30% of the risk off the table with a buy limit order, if price hits my buy limit, I'll move stop to BE. We shall see. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Absolutely on the quiet. Christmas break 3 years ago, took a bearish move on the GJ, it was 1st time trading a holiday for me. The pros had me nervous with all the fear tactics. My account grew 7% in ten days. I still listen to the pros, but I make my 'own' money decisions. Thank you for the input. Reno

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I never want anyone thinking something negative concerning my numbers, the above post says 10 days, that's about 2 weeks of trading. As you could imagine, with the low volume and holidays, it was a gut wrenching 2 weeks. That was 3, maybe 4 years ago. Reno

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Very grateful my CJ 5m just broke through the most recent support level. SIGH of relief. Go bears Go.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Everybody go get a cup of coffee, you deserve it. Good morning to everyone! Coffeeeee. LOL Reno

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I'm very grateful my buy limit was hit. I still need to move my SL to BE. This was a trade on a 5min chart. Rare for me. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #588 ---
It would be wise for me to take some risk off the table with my GJ 1H trade, the trade I took this morning. 139.55 taking half off.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
CJ 5m Sometimes my runner runs, sometimes it does not. This morning it did not. I gained little on my buy limit. Total risk on the entire setup was .5R.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Possible opportunity on the Cable. Not a divergence trade, however it could be a nice reversal. What I like about these trades... a trader had over 21 hours to get in on this trade. If you trade this now, it would have to retrace around 20 pips. I look at the 4H ONLY to see just one of the stochastics lines breaching either 80 or 20, and closing there. It did. Enjoy Reno

--- 帖子 #591 ---
In addition, definitely worth noting; the above chart on the cable, the 833 on the D1 is showing a near perfect HD. Nice.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hello, I am looking at GBPUSD. I have set up the stochs as you posted on page 1. The 1 hour chart is now showing stochs coming into oversold. You are looking at this as a reversal (ie a long gbpusd trade) Pleaselet me know if am following correctly. Thanks

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Quiet bunch. Please tell me someone is generating pips here. I welcome replies and more importantly success. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I haven't entered the GBPUSD trade yet. i am looking at it on the 1 hour chart. Stochs are below 20 and macd still below zero line. I am waiting to pull the trigger

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hello dandzl, you are correct. Current stochastics are indeed showing OS. I often am able to get in on a trade if price retraces back to where I wanted the original entry. Over 20 hours ago, I could've gotten in on this cable trade because price has been rangebound for a while. Sometimes on reversal trades, price will retrace 50% or even more. I use stochastics for my original entry. It's always best to get in a reasonable period of time. You will often see the stochastics indicator go the opposite direction of price. I, for one, will not be going long on the cable. For anyone that is new to the stochastics, go to the 1 min chart when NEW YORK gets back to work or during a normal London session, stare at the indicator and see how it behaves. I've done it. I sat for an hour on the 1 min chart and watched. Do not trade until you are comfortable with the setup. Please do not hesitate to ask another question if you do not understand something. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Nice trade. I read through the thread. I like your method. Simple and profitable. May I ask some clarification questions ? -- Referring to your Post # 587 ... In this successful CJ trade you entered short. I can see from Price Action it made a Lower Low then a Lower High, so PA says bearish. HD is a trend continuation signal. And you took the short and profit. Were there other hints that you observed to help you decide to go short in this trade? You have not mentioned looking at Price Action in your rules. Do you look at PA? I think you sometimes look at higher TF, sometimes not. When would you, and when wouldn't you? Thanks. Bill

--- 帖子 #597 ---
This is why I'm not going long. This is a line chart of the Cable D1. I plotted a standard setting CCI 20. It and the stochastics is showing a bearish move.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hello Reno I am playing few days with OHS strategy (on my demo account yet) and I must say it is the best strategy I've ever seen. Simple, logical and functional - I am in green numbers in 2 days. Thank you very much for excellent work I am grateful I can learn from you. Filip

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hello Bill, I do like to keep things simple. I do sometimes cheat (rules). On the 5m circus event I shared, PA is almost always below the ema, this morning it was not. I knew it wasn't gonna be a big deal. But, this is why; the trend line had already been broken. Now, back to the EMA, I will never pull a short without the candle closing below the EMA. During this reversal/bearish move, the first thing I find are fractal(s), they show me highs and lows and of course that's where my stops will be placed if I trade the pair. During a bearish move, we are looking for only highs only. During a bullish move, we look for lows. This paragraph is for Hidden Divergence only. I plot red trend lines on everything I'm considering. I enjoy sharing. Other hints? Yes. The yen pairs are strong. I do not follow news. I see the news on my 4H charts, it shows me 6 times a day what people want. If I look at a higher TF, that means I want additional clarification before I put my $ on the line. Sometimes, I see a perfect storm (trade) and I set it up without hesitating. I've spent thousands of hours on you toob (sp) and hours reading and hours studying charts. I simply love to trade. I put my socks on the same way you do. Hopefully one foot at a time. LOL Thank you for the reply Bill. I hope you had a Great Christmas. Regards Reno

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hello Filip, That's incredible news. I am thrilled with your success. 2 Days of generating pips. That's fantastic. Please continue to share. I appreciate you sharing that. Great stuff, Reno

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Reno, thank you for your clarification. Now I understand more about what you see before taking a trade. In that CJ trade, I missed seeing the trade requirement about "never pull a short without the candle closing below the EMA". You started showing the EMA in your charts since Post #488. May I suggest consider adding that to the rules in your Post #1? Thank you very much for sharing your trading approach, and your experience. Excellent information here. Divergence is one of my favorite trading tools too. I hope you had a Great Christmas also. Happy trading. Bill

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I did take a HD trade this morning on the GBP/JPY. You can see my entry on this 30m chart. We/you may have another opportunity to short this pair. Be sure the RSI crosses down through the EMA before pulling the trigger. Your entry and stop will be different than mine if you decide to take the trade. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Thank you very much Bill. Edit complete. Thank you for the kind words Bill. I don't know why everyone doesn't use divergence, it's the ONLY leading indicator in any market. Fortunately, you and I both know it and we both enlist it.... often. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Greetings traders, I have just edited page 1 (34 ema) and added a price chart with T/L and entries. It is HD, not a reversal. Go buy a wheel barrel, you're gonna need something to haul all your pips! Reno

USDJPY 4H this trade could last several days.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
This is a trade I took this morning. I'm posting this for the benefit of myself and others. I lost 1R on this trade. Did I have to? No. I had a few options. I did attempt to take some of the risk out of the market, I tried to take profit off the table near the 139.55 level. Price did not reach this level. I could have set a TP at 1:1. I would have had my 1R. I could have taken half off at 1:1. I think if I want a trade to run, it would be wise to let half of my lots run and trail the stop. I will likely start taking half off at 1:1, moving my SL to BE and then letting the rest run it's course. Reno

Are you still doing this?: Template 1...…….. Stochastics 21,4,3 (double check it, some traders get the 4 and the 3 backwards) Template 2...…….. Stochastics 8, 3, 3 with a RSI/EMA (14) in the same window **note page 26-27

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hello Reno, is there any difference in use of the Stochastics 8 and 21? Sometimes I see a divergence on one and not on the other. Is divergence valid for us only if it is on both Stochastics? Or do you use each Stochastic in some specific way? I am a bit confused with these two. Thank you. Filip

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Looks good, hidden divergence is a very good way to stay with the trend. Not the best way because sometimes it appears, sometimes not but 100 times better than countertrending.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I couldn't agree more. Thank you for the comment Petru00. Reno

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Good morning traders, notice what the 2 different indicators are showing on the lower TF. This 883 may be better at showing the HD. The 2143 simply matches the HD (sometimes), however the close of the latter stochastic closely matches the RSI cross. That's why I added it. Reno

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Sorry, this was supposed to be the 2nd chart. I think.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Exactly, Filip you caught that. I often use the 8 3 3 to catch the HD, it's wise to use both. Again, an individual trader decision. Reno

--- 帖子 #614 ---
This chart is the reason I took the trade. Notice I set an alert (red arrow on the right). For those of you setting alerts of any kind, it that in your trade checklist? If my alert goes off, I set up a trade to take profits somewhere during the trade (hopefully). Enjoy Reno

XAU/USD bull...? have any priview master..?

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Yes I do, it's only a mouse click away. We have to put every reason into the mix to pull a trigger. Reno

--- 帖子 #617 ---
This was spotted on the 1H Cable. My 15m trade would have been a losing trade. I took the trade off. My plan is to continue looking on the 15m and the 1H for setups. I should not have even set up the 15m trade. Reno was wrong. Reno

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hey Reno....nice postings of setups man really nice...oh yes and nice pic RUSH - Vapor Trails remixed version in 2013 :-) Yesterday my ISP was down no internet for a few hrs....today is ok,gonna have some lunch now and get back to the forum......great work,keep it up

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Friends, this may be a good time to top off the coffee. If the criteria is not being met, no trading. Reno

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Good morning scsstnt, Thank you for the kind words again. My charts kinda did a hiccup this morning. It'll happen. Yes, I'm a big time RUSH fan for decades. Don't know if we'll get any real setups on the hourly today or not. I will likely check every couple of hours. Thx Reno (big Neil Peart fan)

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Good morning Iko, I must admit, I chuckled at your comment. Trust me, I master only me and sometimes that is a work in progress. LOL. I do have a 'tiny' live account. It is over $100. I don't think my account is large enough to trade Gold. If XAU is not gold, then I definitely don't need to be trading it. LOL. Make it a fantastic day Iko, Reno

--- 帖子 #622 ---
The 21 and the 8 3 3 both look nice on this 4H beauty. Exercise caution first and decide if you want the HD setup or the RD setup. It may be best to check a higher TF. Reno

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I'm probably gonna take the trade on the 4H. I'll setup only after the RSI cross. I mention that because it looks like the 21 may cross before the RSI, which I believe is rare. USD/JPY 4H. In addition, I will likely wait an hour to set up my PO. I may not have to deal with the trade at all (inverted H/S). Reno

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Anyone trading the early morning aussie would've bagged some pips. This was good on the 21 and the 8. Reno

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I did decide to thicken up my EMA a bit.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Possible HD signal on UJ 15m, may show on the 833, not so much on the 21. Keeping an eye out.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
A lot of momentum on UJ, be careful if you short. Anyway, if you want to short it look for trend exhaustion (normal divergence) on smaller timeframes (3m-5m). This tehnique helps you sniping the entry without sufferind DD Petru

--- 帖子 #628 ---
I kinda felt a bit foolish after posting that, price shot bullish shortly after I posted. We sit and wait. Thx Reno

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Haha, you don't have to. The setup still looks great. Petru

ACH 30m set this up yesterday afternoon. It triggered this morning. Good morning to all, Reno

Swissy showing strength on most pairs. R

Pulled trigger on this one yesterday. GU. It is now a BE trade. It is not a divergence trade. It is not a 1 hour chart. I held on through the news this morning. I plan to carry this through the weekend. R-

UCH, a daily chart, continuation trade. I pulled the trigger at NYC. : ) 2nd chart is from the same pair, 1H TF 2 hours before the NFP. It's been in negative territory for a while. Some you win, some you lose. R-

I remember a mentor telling me I could be a successful trader if I won … 30% … of my trades. At the time, I thought he was just wanting my $. Nope, he could burn my $. Moral to the quoted post, FRIENDS, sometimes ya gotta find a winner and let it run. Note my tiny lot size, I have lost half my trades I've taken. This 'cable' trade is up 1%. It has made up for 'both' of my morning losses. Of course subject to SL placement, etc. R-

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Greetings Traders, I rarely use a TP. This pair is not my norm, however my mentor also taught me you're never gonna be able to participate in an UP or DOWN move unless you have skin in the game. I certainly hope this goes UP or DOWN, been rangebound for a while. Check the W1. P.s. if I could spell without editing, it would be a miracle. LOL R-

--- 帖子 #636 ---
NOTE the blue TL. This is my favorite setup and favorite way to trade. HD. Stochastics was screaming keep going! The 2nd item I noticed was where the RSI peaked at on the 27th, just as PA reversed... MTF. &gt;80 on the 1H and 4H, 70 on the daily. Y'all have a safe weekend. R-

What's the name of the last book I read on trading? What did I learn? Did I finish the book? (I am so guilty) Who am I hanging out with and how is it affecting my work? Is that ok? What character traits must I work on to become a successful trader? Do I have a Trader's Constitution (a vision), a checklist, a written plan at my workstation? Do I recite aloud my Constitution twice daily before and after trading? Where will YOU be in a year, 5 years, 10?, 20? Decide... is to 'cut off' from any other possibility. R-

15m chart of the swissy. Two opportunities that would have had you out of the market well before NFP. These trades happen all the time on all TF.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Big E (Eric) stated multiple times he'd gladly trade the TDI cross at 32 or 68, it's just 'easy money' according to him. On the 15m chart above, where did the TDI (14 RSI/MA) cross at? Yep, at the 68 level. Enjoy R-

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Both of these trade opportunities were HD. GJ 1H. Both trades could've been triggered in the early morning. I would've closed out a trade like this by manually trailing the stop. SL 2-3 pips below the low of the candle once it closes. The first trade could've been set at 2R while manually trailing the stop. The 2nd trade could've been managed by the same. Plot a horizontal line at 2R and 3R once the trade triggers. If you think price will head to 3R, continue with manual stops to avoid a whip. Under normal circumstances, I exit a trade once RSI crosses MA and the candle changes color. R-

--- 帖子 #641 ---
NJ 1H One Hour Sniper trade. The RSI indicated an hour early entry candle, I chose to wait on a stochastic cross. Both candles closed within 4 to 5 pips of each other. Enjoy R-

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Daily chart- 10 sweet trading days 300 odd pips. 1st trade you see, stop would've been under the trigger candle itself. I look to buy when RSI breaches 32-ish. Do you have the patience for a D1 chart? 2nd opportunity is a HD. I may lighten things up a bit soon. R-

--- 帖子 #643 ---
4H CHFJPY reversal candle. Decided to lighten things up a bit. RSI and MA at 68 Stochastic already leaning down. Wait at least 1 hour if you decide to trade Sunday unless you wish to fork over a 20 pip spread. I... will be waiting on a complete RSI cross (I need to see daylight). My stop will likely be 3 pips over the trigger candle. Candle needs to be red. It's my money, right? Enjoy R-

Happy thanksgiving to all.

This chart is from last month, showing the stochastic in OS territory on the 4H. The 2nd chart is the 1H. Always wait for a candle to change color and a complete cross of the stochastic. A successful sniper has one bullet, it cannot be wasted.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
AUDUSD showing a HD setup. Enjoy

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Do you cheat? Do you bend the rules? Getting in early may benefit you in the short term, but it may cost you in the long haul. None of us want to wait 3 bars to enter a trade.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Stochastics OB on the D1 Stochastics OB on the 4H Stochastics OB on the 1H Imagine setting a limit order at the 78 fib level. The 1st vertical line was a OHS trade, the 2nd line was a simple HD trade. I hope everyone had a great weekend. There are likely better strategies out there, I think I'm gonna stick with this one. Happy Trading to all.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
When taking reversal trades, I plot a vertical line when the sto reaches OB or OS, but wait for a smaller candle, which is a signal that a reversal may be coming.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Everyone here loves a good mystery, we spend countless hours trying to figure it all out. Some say keeping it simple is the best approach to trading. All of us want to be employed by self. Go find someone who has what you want and do what they do over and over and you will have what they have. Don't forget to take time out for you. Celebrate all victories, large and small. Happy Trading to all.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I just put a p.o. for a bearish move on the cable. G/U 1H.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
some you'll win, some you'll lose. Entry was taken from a smaller time frame.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
sometimes I'll use the 24 stochastics, sometimes the 833. Stochastics on both 1H and 4H are well below 20.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
EJ is showing bearish. 1H chart is setting up to be a trigger for me. The red trend line at price tells me the bulls are done for now. I also drew a line towrds the stochastics to show I like to wait on a cross. This time I probably would not have. The sto crosses and candle color changes do not always happen at the same time.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
4H chart. I go to the 1H to pull the trigger however, the 1H is a mess. I may wait for a candle change and go with it. 4H looks great.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
I use 3 oscillators to identify HD. I was a bit late on one of these entries. 21,4,3 and the 8,3,3.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Finding the tops and bottoms is not my objective in trading. Any trader, with the right management can support a family harvesting just 50% of any given major move. Simply waiting for a candle change and OS/OB will end in a fair day for anyone. IMO

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Someone asked me which oscillator I prefer to use. My answer was simple. I told them to take any indicator 'they' liked and watch it for for 1 hour on the 1 minute time frame during the london session. If I see a top or bottom or a HD, It doesn't matter to me which indicator I use. Experiment with a small lot size, you may learn a great deal. I know I have.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
My apologies.... when you watch an indicator for an hour on the 1 min or maybe the 5m, you'll have a much better awareness of how that indicator behaves depending upon what price is doing, up, down, or ranging.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Merry Christmas to EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. May you all harvest many pips and many wins. Greetings RENO/ M.Y.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
THE kiwi is shaking things up. Be on the lookout for a nice HD set up.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Much better this time. How many HD do we see here?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
EG 1H valid and good looking set up. I would have taken this trade. I would have lost. Not all trades win.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I did participate in this HD trade. I based it off the wild swing in the stochastics. I did glance at the 4H and the D1, both of which gave me confidence. The horizontal line shows where i placed a trail stop, price shot up like a rocket. I don't mind giving some of my profit back, but certainly not all of it.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Strategy still works. I'll let YOU check the 4H. Rules have not only been met, the RSI,EMA saved us from a horrible early entry. Yes, I want to see daylight with my RSI/EMA cross before I put my $ on the line.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
One Hour Sniper. Exits... wait for 1:1 Wait for 2:1 Trail daily low or finally.. Wait for RSI to close below 50!!! With the latter 2 exits, you'd be eating steak tonight. I want to stress, I wait until I see daylight with my RSI/EMA cross.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
One Hour Sniper. Take a quick peek at the D1. I'm either gonna win or lose this trade.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Stochastics on both the 1H and the 4H got my attention. The D1 chart convinced me. I hope everyone enjoys their weekend.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Anyone still here?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Been busy trading. Hope all is well with all fellow traders.
