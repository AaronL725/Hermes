Hi, I look for nearly the same setups as yours. can you please upload your charts to see them bigger, thanks

--- 帖子 #3 ---
ok i have uploaded indicator and images

--- 帖子 #4 ---
ok. Much better know. Getting a bit more in the details, The setup looks well, what strategy are you using for SL and TP. Trading on Daily (in my opinión perfect), the Sl needs to be quit far away. Looking on the chart you have to put the SL above/below the previous candle. What you think about the TP on fixed pips (depending of the account I should put it on 1 or 2% of the account) ronichimo

--- 帖子 #5 ---
i want to get in and out quickly with high hitrate so i use 10Pips stop and Takeprofit For EU,GU and AU. Other pairs like USDCHF, i used 7Pips. I used Risk% per trade.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
In &amp; out asap, perfect. But a 10 pips SL is too short no? After entering you need the PA go right to the TP before the retracement, no?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
That sounds a good strategy Swilliam. Did you try to build an EA for automated trade or you trade only manually?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Any trading stats available for this strategy?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I only trade manually, because sometimes i consider fundamentals before place a trade. I also dont have ea for the strategy William

--- 帖子 #10 ---
When you're using such a small stop loss on a daily time frame (where you can't see the small price moves), you can't get an accurate probability of this method. Where you've marked those entries, plot it on the chart and move to a 5min time frame and see if, after making a new low/high and triggering your order, price continues straight through to hit your TP. Alternatively there's a good chance price fluctuates back and forth a bit before going to your TP, in which case you could have very well been stopped out, but on the daily chart looks like a successful trade. I've done the first one for you... your very first BUY example that you posted in your chart was stopped out - see attached. Now just do it for say 500 trades according to the rules and we'll be able to gauge how probable this method could be lol

--- 帖子 #11 ---
sure anyone can test the method. The image i posted included lossing trades. Its normal to hit SL for me. I only Need at least 60% win rate to have postive traders equation on long run. Again , very easy, no fancy indicators just price action

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I'm not questioning your method, and of course everyone will have losses using any method or system they use, but where do you get that figure of 60% win rate from? That's what I'm trying to get at, to find a percentage win rate you'd have to literally check each and every trade (back testing) or forward test it for an extended period of time before coming up with a percentage that will be accurate. And by back test I mean you must break each trade down to a lower time frame to see what price action does. This alone could be very, very time consuming to accumulate the appropriate amount of data, unless it's possible to have it coded to view the stats? Or, I could be wrong all together and you've been using this method for the last 2 years successfully in which case it has been tested

--- 帖子 #13 ---
if you found other value for stoploss is better or other exit method , please share to us so we can improve the system even better.!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
flying visit,, the daily breakout strategy is a very simple and very profitable trading method but a 10 stop loss is ridiculous, it can work as just happened with e/j unless the thread owner intends to get back into the trade should he be busted or martingale etc, Bigger stop loss lots of potential, be good ,trDE WELL

--- 帖子 #15 ---
thanks. for suggestions, but its possible that to avoid trade going to hit STOP, is application of time filter. Like Placing an oder above high or below low onnly during london session. Since asia session gives false breakouts. but it can cause some setups to be missed. Tomorrow will be start of trading, hope others will also test so we can improve the system but keep it as simple as Possible

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Is USD/CAD a setup right now? maybe a few pips past open! Except no mon trades?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
i prefer not to trade monday but if you did, the Buy would have been triggered and hit takeprofit https://charts.mql5.com/5/205/usdcad...boforex-lp.png https://charts.mql5.com/5/205/usdcad...boforex-lp.png

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi William, Thanks for sharing! May I clarify what do you mean by 1 TICK? For example if the previous day CLOSE (Above Monthly and Weekly Open) was 1.34567 (for EUR/USD. I am using Ironfx which has 5 decimals) What is the entry value? Thanks !!!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Example: Yesterdays Closing Price @ 1.12300 Above Monthly &amp; Weekly Open Yesterday's High @ 1.12400 Enter Buy if price goes above Yesterday's High at least 1 tick or at least 1.12401

--- 帖子 #20 ---
OIC!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
SO SIMPLE!!! Love it, might throw some pips on this baby!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Swilliams, Doing a bit homework waiting for tomorrow`s beginning I have a question. I`ll try to explain me. Following the rule: Opening a oprder with one tick diference (buy or sell), after TP was hit and candle closing at the end of the day, correct. Well, on next day what strategy shall we use... because going back on charts, it happens quite a while that for several days the trend or the candles are going back to weekly`s and monthly`s levels... all these following days normally we are stopped out... The candles can stay the hall week (of course) between weekly and monthly I`m looking if using, for these days, a H4 chart we could do something about, but I don`t really see it. What do you think about?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
If the close of the previous daily bar is above Weekly or Monthly Open, The Bias is always long! Until it's not satisfied. So we just keep on placing buy stop orders 1 tick above previous day's high. The candle close relative to the open lines is our direction filter. There are days when the bar close will be between the Monthly and Weekly Open lines, thus no trade will be taken on that pair. There are other pairs to look from. There should be at least one trade a day I havent tested 4H charts, you can share your findings.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Also asking you if you tried the strategy with the respective STOP orders and once the order opened trying to fix a trailing stop because on daily charts the moves can be quite huges. Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi, Trading the Daily is perfect, I said using the H4 just to find something to filter the orders when candles are in between Weekly and Monthly. Which are the currencies you trade? R

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Actually i think that strategy can be applied specially if the breakout happens on london time. The reason why i stated the targets is because i want to exit quick and run with profits asap but keeping my RR at least 1:1 If breakout happened on asia session, i expect it to go to TP then reverse most of the time. so its better to exit quickly, On London, the breakout usually goes 20 pips on average . Thanks for your insights,

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Swilliams, Which are the currencies you trade. I`ll use the same as yours so we can test at least two forms (with trailing stop or moving to BE or higher / lower SL depending of lot size...) Also it is interesting to know which platform you`re using (gmt) because there can be a difference when your daily candle close respect of mine.) At least we can try to use the same one or at the same GMT time. Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #28 ---
swilliams, Trying on XM platform (demo), Daily candle just closed, so the next pending orders are: GBP/USD : SS: 1.70690 // TP: 1.70590 //SL: 1.70790 USD/JPY : BS: 101.613 // TP: 101.713 // SL:: 101.513 Not correlated pairs. I try to see doing it without looking for London open. Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi, GBP/USD: SL on 1.70790 (market News on GBP in 1/2 hour). One hour ago could have put a BE for not having a open order 1 hour before breaking news. Waiting for the other order USD/JPY at this moment -91 pips, so, close to SL Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #31 ---
i use roboforex, MY GBPUSD hit takeprofit 10 pips. I trade GBPUSD, EURUSD most of the time. Im not sure for optimized target on JPY pairs

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi, at what time have you opened the order?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I opened an other order before, by mistake, just when my daily candle closed. Forgot to put a stop (pending) order an opened on market time. That one closed on TP. But it was not by the rule. I´ll see for opening an account on the same broker to be able discuss about the trades. (on same broker`s time)

--- 帖子 #34 ---
ALL broker i use had the same results i used roboforex and FXCM GBPUSD yesterday's low = 1.70688 SELL order on 1.70687 SL ant TP = 10 pips Almost all brokers now operate in GMT +3. So there should be no difference on daily bars high and lo starting 2nd day of the week. http://s11.postimg.org/ey3v3err7/chart0.png http://s11.postimg.org/dhscl9oub/chart1.png

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Correct, same as mine (see chart). Viewing on shorter TF the lowest pip (hit TP, was on 1.70587). On your chart it seems to be lower. I put you the H1 chart on next message. Is that for the broker or because "demo"? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Except for this "tecnical" incidence, it seems to have worked. tonight we go for other pips... ronichimo

--- 帖子 #37 ---
These are the other lowest point with other brokers. same candle, same time ALPARI U.K @ 1.70581 THINK FOREX @ 1.70588 BMF @ 1.70552 EXCEL MARKETS @ 1.70586 It seems I`ve took the worst one to test the strategy... I´ll start with ROBOFOREX to use the same for testing the strategy What should have been the real low on LIVE-account?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I looked for ROBOFOREX but it seems to be a Market Maker... so I`ll test it with ALPARI (but I`m not sure if with micro account it is ECN)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi William and ronichimo How do both you set the buy and sell stop? I mean what is the suitable time? Do you wait at the end of day to see where the Daily candle closed before you set the BUy/ SEL stop?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Yes, as SWilliams told, we wait for the daily candle close on put a pending order 1 pip below/higher. We started yesterday and first order closed in TP.(SWilliams). My brokers seems to have used a higher lowest point, but for only 3 pips Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Sorry, 1 pip below or higher of the just closed dalily candle`s lowest or highest point

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi, Someone placed some orders yet?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
YES took the NZDUSD &amp; AUDUSD short

Hi, i took AUDUSD with 10 pips SL &amp; TP. Trade hit TP http://s29.postimg.org/oay0nvxjb/image.png http://s29.postimg.org/mx6dsky9z/image.png

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi William, nice trade, congrate! However could you please enlarge and sharper your image because they are blur to me. I attached my chart image which show different price from yours... would it be issue in trading your strategy? My chart shows yesterday's LOW is 0.93482 (which different from yours 0.93474) So, if I would trade today I would take SELL Pending order at 0.93481....am I right?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi RTM May I ask why SHORT for NU? My chart shows yesterday (15/7) closed in between Monthly and Weekly line... which is NO TRADE according to Sir William's strategy... Or am i missing anything??

--- 帖子 #48 ---
On AUDUSD, the low of my broker is 0.93476 So i sell on 0.93475 You can click on my chart to enlarge the view. FXCM is the one i use a reference, i dont trade 1st days because of the Sunday candle which cause confusion to different brokers

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi, If Sunday candle has a good range it can be used ( for the brave) Friday figures can be traded even though it is short hours, trade well

--- 帖子 #50 ---
You have dif broker I guess because I got a nice close below and nice pips too!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Your chart is unclear also. Cant see last candle?

I repost the image so that you can see the last (today candle)... Yesterday (15/7/2014) candle was closed within the Monthly and Weekly Open line... I may be cause by diff broker?

Hi traders, Second day with the strategy. Today we can try to find out what are the filters for opening a order. For example, just to find out when or when not put an order I opened several charts and try to find out when NOT open an order, even if everything is accordet to the rules. ( D candle closing above/under the weekly and monthly open). I opened those following charts yesterday: eur/usd, gbp/usd, eur/jpy,aud/usd usd/chf. usd/jpy, gbp/jpy, usd/cad following the rules, exept Eur/JPY and Gbp/JPY, all were able to trade according with the Basic Rules I opened orders for those 6 currencies pairs, (at this momento I`m only talking about the strategy and NOT about money managment) While I`m writing this message, the last order has closed. Here are the results: Eur/Usd: Sell - TP Gbp/Usd; Buy - SL Aud/Usd: Sell - TP Usd/Jpy: Buy - SL Usd/Chf: Buy - TP Usd/Cad: Buy - SL More than the pairs with TP, I`m interested in those pairs where SL was hitted, let`s try, all togheter, find out why it went wrong, even if we opened by "rules" Just find out by pair "individually", I know that Eur/Usd and Gbp/Usd are correlated for example, but each pair was opended on the strategy. So, let´s all do some homework and find out the filters before the D-Candle closes... and make new pips tonight... Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi nsn14, The first day I started with Swilliams it happened to me also... I suppose it was for using a different bróker and demo account. ( look back on the first messages) Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks R Another thing I wish to clarify, if TODAY candle started with GAP UP or GAP down, are we still follow the basic rule?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
For instance, if yesterday's candle closed above both Month and Week at 1.30000. Follow the basic rule, today we shall place BUY Pending order at 1.30001. Situation 1: However, today the price GAP UP to 1.30010, and never hit our Pending Order and the price goes up and BULL CANDLE formed, what shall we do? Situation 2: Today the price GAP UP to 1.30010 and after that minute, the price falls down and hit our BUY Order at 1.30001, and the price goes further down forming BEAR CANDLE. What shall we do? Opinion needed, thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
In forex those GAP often happen between Friday`s close and Sunday`s open... we don´t trade on sundays. Sometimes, if I haven`t closed a trade on friday I`ll move my SL as close as posible to the PA... if happens a Gap on my favor on Sunday... better, if not I limited the lose. I start from the opinión that I already risked (SL) by opening the order, so if the SL was triggered it was the same risk. If the position was in benefit AND if it`s a carrie-trade, better for me. The second question has nearly the same answer... but as we use pending orders, and I start to "see" diferent things than when I placed it, by cancelling this order problem solved... There are other pairs to trade... Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks Ronichimo! What is your opinion if the OPEN of 'TODAY' already exceeded 1 tick which is also suppose to be our PENDING ORDER. But we havent manage to key in that time. For instance, we suppose to placed BUY Pending order at price 1.30001 but TODAY OPEN price is 1.30001 and price goes North after that. Shall we place another pending order which is higher that the actual one? Or we still placed the same Pending order at 1.30001, hope for the price to pull back and hit our pending order? PS : And what is the 'different things that you see with placing pending order? mind to share with us?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
In my opinión we have to keep trading so simple as posible. If your strategy is "A" and happens a "A+1" just let it go. This won`t be YOUR system anymore. If there was only one currency available in Forex market, other history, but there are many currencies to trade with your own system. Don´t try to fix the PA on your strategy... every strategy has is own "PA". Said in other words, if the strategy (in this case) is pending order one pip above/below previous close... that`s it... Every strategy has is own "moment",... but remenber, in this thread, started by SWilliam, we are starting and trying to get fixed it as best as posible... we still need to find some filters for when or when not use the pending orders. Last one, by "diferent" things I mean everything what is not in accordance with the strategy... example, if pending order is Buy 1 pip above and before the order is triggered, there is a loo...oong bearisch candle going on, I close the pending order, PA has moved to much yet, other case is for example, same situation, order is not triggered yet and in 1/2 hour will be a BIG news, I prefer cancel the order and wait... tomorrow will be more forex trades, it not depends of one trade and one day... be patient Ronichimo P.S Don´t think soo much in what "in case of" and look more in "what happened yet"... to avoid a future mistake. I`m looking why some orders went wrong yesterday (today) and try to figure out why it happened and not repeat it tomorrow. Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thanks Ronichimo again! I agree with your observation on "different things". During the day, after our BUY pending order was triggered, PA will changes direction to the south hitting our Stop Lost before heading South to our Take Profit....

--- 帖子 #63 ---
as i mentioned before, the application of a simple timefilter can reduce possible loss. If you place the order on london open, there will be more chance that price will not come back at hit TP first. The drawdown is, you might miss the trade when it breakout during asia session. In my observation, an overshoot even in asia session can hit TP. If its small around 7-10pips. so keeping a tight stop same as the TP can ensure profitability with at least 60% win rate If orders are triggered on asia session, there is a possiblity that price will immidiately pullback after breakout (false bo) SO far these is the 100% clear &amp; mechanical method i can suggest without using indicators and vague price action reading With regards to pairs, i use 10Pips targets on eurusd, gbpusd and audusd, 7 pips on USDCHF You can try other pairs, Like JPY, CAD &amp; NZD cross to optimize a good target value, but i dont trade thos in live. please share your results, thanks everyone for joining William

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi, swilliams, By placing yur order "on London open" it can be that the PA already passed the previous day`s high/low, what are you doing then? Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Yes, if you place trades on the london open, the drawdown is trades might be missed and it can significantly reduce trades. But on the other hand, can increase winrate because london breakouts will cause less false signals compared to asia session. As for me, i dont use timefilter, i just place an order at the end of the day and set my targets. But i only trade the pairs that i have confidence on (EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDCHF)

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Ok. Just for confirmation. My D-candle ends at GMT+1, it means 8 hours before London`s open. At which GMt-time you open the orders? When you say D-candle close´s + 1 pip... when is it. Or are you just opening direct orders just before London? I`ll try to upload a Excel sheet with the GMT times of each sesión and so trying to use all of us the same time-units for the strategy. As I said in one of the first threads, not all brokers are using the same D-Candle. If you use a Australian bróker (eg. ROBOFOREX), his D-candle closes at 06.00 GMT, just 2 hours before London while a European bróker (eg. ALPARI-UK) closes 8 hours before. this is the reason why using the pending orders on some of use the order is triggered on asian sesión and on other nearer to London`s open. Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #67 ---
i updated first post for clearer trade examples for those who want to see

--- 帖子 #68 ---
An Excel sheet imposible. but here I write it down... Session: ASIAN: Sidney: GMT 22.00 - 06.00 // Tokyo: GMT 00.00 - 08.00 During Asian session the most traded pairs are YEN, GBP and US$ with a volatility of 60 to 120 pips... EUROPEAN: London: GMT 08.00 - 16.00 During European session the most traded pairs are EUR, GBP and US$ with a volatility of 80 to 120 pips... AMERICAN: New York: GMT 13.00 - 21.00 During American sesión the most traded pairs are US$, GBP and YEN with a volatility of 70 to 140 pips... Hope it helps to understand us no matter the bróker or place we are and making all lots of pips.. Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hello, your thoughts are very interesting. And the strategy is simple and therefore I want to test it as well. In addition I have a question that is here not new: I take always the broker time to determine when Yesterday ends (broker 24.00) and Today starts? If it is at FXCM 24.00, it's me 03.00 CEST (Germany) and I sleep. What do I do now, I have to get up early and work? It may be that the high formed in the last hour after 23.00. And a question to swilliam: How many days you use this method already without interruption and how much is your winning rate?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi, As you can read in the previous posts, that`s one of the problems we are talking about. in fact, I don´t think the problem is with the bróker, the problema can be the sesión we are trading. Swilliamexplained well before the diference between Asia and European sesión, there is more volatility in european and in the Asian can have a bigger withdraw before going to TP. I`m testing Swilliam´s strategy with to brokers now (in fact I start tonight). With one bróker I`ll use the strategy adapting it on my "lifestyle" (I life in Spain) and with the other one I`ll put the orders just before London`s sesión (as Swilliam)... What I gonna try is during the asian sesión, using a higher SL (see money managment rules) and see what happen. With the other bróker the strategy as written in the first threads. The only candle that for all broker`s is the same is the 1H candle... and you also know in the asian sesión there is less volatility, so try to adapt the SL and Tp. Hope it was clear enough and could help you, ronichimo

--- 帖子 #71 ---

EU trade lost yesterday (17/7/2014), price got triggered at 1.35202 but then went north hits my SL at 1.35302. GU not trigger yesterday. For EU, my broker Yesterday's LOW : 1.35157, according to basic rule we have to place SELL Pending order at 1.35156 however currently the price is already lower then yesterday low (1.35136), can I still trade? For GU, yesterday's trade not trigger, therefore I cancelled the BUY pending order. Today I look at the chart, the bias changed from BUY to SELL. Yesterday's low was 1.70846, and follow the basic rule, we shall placed SELL Pending order of 1.70845. However, I wake up late this morning and today's price was already lower than 1.70845 to 1.70832 and then price went up to 1.70867 now, shall I re-entry my SELL Pending order at 1.70845??? See chart below please..

Hi Ronichimo, Thanks for advise. However, what is your opinion on GU? I edited my previous post, can you read it again. Thanks

--- 帖子 #83 ---
GU was triggered on @ 1.70840. Still open, I`ve put a trailing stop of 50p in case of. I use to try closing all my trades on friday, won`t open new orders. Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Ronichimo If the price for entry (basic rule ) is 1.70840 and when the time we wake up it was already lower than 1.70840, what would you do? We enter in market order or we wait the price to retrace back above 1.70840 before we enter SELL pending order?

Hi all, I am probably in the wrong thread but looking for advice on backtesting and hope someone can help. The dates in the MT4 tester don't allow me to change them. What do I need to do? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
One question if you don't mind... Do you have the .mq4 file for this indicator? I'm trying to input it into a backtester/EA program, but it requires the .mq4 and doesn't accept the ex4. Thanks

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi ! this is result i am backtest your system.Anything wrong ? Inserted Code void OnTick() { //--- double MOPEN = iOpen(Symbol(),PERIOD_M1,0); double WOPEN = iOpen(Symbol(),PERIOD_W1,0); double PreClose = iClose(Symbol(),PERIOD_D1,1); double PreHigh = iHigh(Symbol(),PERIOD_D1,1); double PreLow = iLow(Symbol(),PERIOD_D1,1); double CLOSE = iClose(Symbol(),PERIOD_D1,0); if (Bars != ThisBarTrade ) { ThisBarTrade = Bars; // ensure only one trade opportunity per bar AllowTrade=true; } if(PreClose&gt;MOPEN &amp;&amp; PreClose&gt;WOPEN &amp;&amp; CLOSE&gt;PreHigh &amp;&amp; CountOrdersThisPairBUY()&lt;Maxorders){ Take_Position(true); AllowTrade=false; } if(PreClose&lt;MOPEN &amp;&amp; PreClose&lt;WOPEN &amp;&amp; CLOSE&lt;PreLow &amp;&amp; CountOrdersThisPairSELL()&lt;Maxorders){ AllowTrade=false; } ManagerPosition(); } Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi all, I made a limited manual backtest on NU that brings interesting results I think although the period backtested is limited. Here it goes: Backtest from March 2014 until now. Pair: NU 1) Backtest 1: pending order placed at end of the day. Total trades: 35 % wins: 60% of which 57% occured during the asian session % loss: 40% of which 100% occured during the asian session 2) Backtest 2: pending order placed at Franfort open. If current Price is below/above previous day low/high and during the sesión Price come back with a close above/below on the 5 TF, pending order would be placed. Total trade: 23 % win: 78% % loss: 22% 3) Backtest 3: pending order placed at Franfort open. If current Price has breached below/above previous day low/high during the asian session, no trade. Total trades: 9 % win: 100% Hope you'll find that useful.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Same backtest for EU since March 23th: 1. Pending order at end of the day: Number of trades: 26 % win: 35% of which 22% during asian session % loss: 65% of which 35% during asian sesión 2. Pending order at Frankfort open: Number of trades: 26 % win: 50% % loss: 50%

Backtest from March 23TH 2014 until now. Pair: GU 1) Backtest 1: pending order placed at end of the day.

Backtest from April 22TH 2014 until now. Pair: uchf Total trades: 21 % wins: 67% % loss: 33% All trades were taken outside the asian session save for 1 that resulted in a loss.

Backtest from March 23TH 2014 until now. Pair: AU 1) Backtest 1: Total trades: 29 % wins: 55% of which 63% occured during the asian session % loss: 45% of which 85% occured during the asian session 2) Backtest 2: Total trade: 20 % win: 55% % loss: 45% 3) Backtest 3: Total trades: 8 % win: 75% % LOSS: 25% My conclusion from this limited backtesting is that we may have high probability trades for AU and NU if the first breakout occurred outside the asian session. By the way, TP hit on NU, AU and UCHF today ! Thanks for sharing Swillian !

HI, today i have 3 loss trades! -&gt; aud/usd, usd/cad and nzd/usd 2 of them because of spread i think?!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
It's probably not best to trade this method on the day of non-farm payroll being released. Too much volatility on both sides.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I had NU hit TP before NFP and AU SL after NFP. You better choose a low spread broker (NU went 11 pips below yeaterday low for my broker). I'm not convinced by UCAD (12 losses out of 19 trades since May 29th).

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Whats your Broker? I have FXCM , i thinks thats not the best for good spreads greetz Michael

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I really like this strategy. Simple and easy to understand. But, Im a new to forex. Just a quick question that I hope anyone can answer for me. The rules seem simple enough. We look at the parameters of the trade by looking at the daily chart. Then we place the trade on the 5M chart. My question is, at what timeframe of the day do we look to the place the trade? Is it at the beginning of a the US, Asia, London sessions? Or at the start of the day at 1201am? And if its at the start of an actual day, on which timezone is it? I would really appreciate someone helping me out a little. Adam

--- 帖子 #128 ---
you place the order on the open of the day. Or the open of a new candle of your broker. SWilliam

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Swilliam, I did further backtesting on a larger period for UCHF and NU and results show win percentage of 50/55%. In my opinion, not a pattern that can be traded mechanically. There were too many losses during low volatility market. However, I notice that a large part of the wins resulted from clear cut breakouts, probably from high impact news. Need to be further investigated, but may be the way to go is to set pending orders just before high impact news. May be we could even remove the filter of previous day close. Today GU gave me 10 pips on news release: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just thinking loudly.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
great findings, thanks and we hope to improve this system. Im looking at your suggestion regarding major news. i only do the trades in forward test so far, on my part without adding timefilter i have a win rate or around 70% using 1:1 Risk reward on the pairs i trade. the pairs i only trade on live are EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDCHF is a second priority and i dont take if i have open position on the 3 main pairs SWilliam

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Great. I had set up a trade explorer on a €100 demo account running for 1 week now. Will keep on forward testing with news and report if you don't mind.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
From the 17th July on GU at first looks like it's been very successful. But of the 7 possible trades there were just 3 winners and 4 losers. For JUNE/JULY there was a total of 17 trades with only 7 winners. Looking back at this 'system' it only manages 50% at best. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Whilst the OP's rules for GU in JUNE/JULY show a 41% win rate 7/17 , if you were to place the SL at the opposing end of the bar before your trade and still take 1:1 the results switch to: 10/17 winners 59% win rate ie: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Chasing your losses is the worst possible thing you can do. I think at some point you're going to have to face the fact that it's just not profitable (like the hundreds of other breakout systems). It can easily be back tested and from what I've seen it just doesn't work. Until someone posts a spreadsheet of 500 results showing otherwise I'd think you're best to move on.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thanks for feedback This 2nd trade is still on testing, if somebody finds it usefull. And somebody show statistical results about it would be great. I basically only do 1st Trade. And for me the strategy works until now

--- 帖子 #140 ---

2 winning trades today.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
i like the 2nd trade approach! will definitely try this out

--- 帖子 #147 ---
As expected.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Willy, I just wanted to inform you. I am getting the trend direction from Daily, Weekly and Monthly Open line. I will add more lots and hold the trades as much as possible. So if rate moved up from monthly line, weekly line and now trading below the daily line. You wait for the price to cross the daily line with a Stop Order. Just like the Scalping strategy. Sometimes, there is a mismatch between Daily and Weekly (like price below Weekly but above Daily, while all above monthly), Then we take weekly open line or wait till price moves further, until we are clear. I will tell more on money management, if interested. Edit: Went long in the beginning of the month and trying to come out of the loss.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
He does not need to prove anything, this is a well tried ,tested very old method and it works very well.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Just to add my 2 cents... I found that the win rate was slightly lower than I'd hoped for when I manually backtested, so I've been experimenting with reducing the TP to 5 pips. This creates a less desirable R/R ratio, but I found that the win % went up significantly. The highest I found was 88% win rate on AUD/USD from Jan to current when reducing to 5 pips TP. Keeping the SL at 15 means risk/reward ratio of 3:1 so one has to be right over 75% to profit. I think this is easily achievable.. So far I'm 4/4 after making this adjustment. I'll continue to update my progress with this variation.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Please do share your insights Regards Swilliam

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Yes, decreasing TP would significantly increase winrate. So far, there are times that price nearly touces the 10Pip TP then reverses, 5 pips maybe a better target on this current market condition Please update Us Swilliam

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I ADDED on first post *ON THE PROCESS* on first Post Aside from the basic trading approach, we are testing the possibility of 1. Trading only when news is approaching 2. Decreasing TP to 5Pips significantly increases win rate in this current market condition 3. Application of 2nd trade easily recovers a loss FF Members pease hsare you insignts to we can determine the best approach as possible Warm Regards Swilliam

Hi there swilliam, I'm new to here and your strategy. Just want to ensure that I'm following steps by steps to your strategy rules, are there sell stop EUR/USD around 1.33330 and buy stop AUD/USD around 0.93740? GBP/USD has no trade since yesterday high is between monthly and weekly open. Am I correct? Please guide me if I'm doing it wrong. Thank you very much!!

yes, Sell stop on EU, buy stop on AU

Hi, do you think only 5 pips is better? thanks

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi, I think the ratio of SL to TP is 3:1 better because winning rate is higher than 2:1 ratio. Thanks,

1 win today GBPUSD +5pip and I'm waiting other pairs

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Willy, sorry for late reply. As mentioned earlier, I am using the entry techniques for long term position building. The money management is the courtesy of FTI (another amazing trader). He never gave more detail but he sure narrated it in one of his posts. Its called fibo money management. position 1 - 1X lots position 2 - 1X lots position 3 - 2X lots position 4 - 4X lots position 5 - 8X lots position 6 - 16X lots if you see above each position is sum of all previous positions. example position 3 = position 2 + position 1. the challenge is to maintain one direction (buy or sell) throughout. in the beginning position 1 and position 2 could be opposite direction, but eventually they are in the same direction. The total lot size at any point should be within your risk parameter. FTI never exit on a Stop loss. If he exits probably its an opposite order and it triggered another new lot in the original direction. Hope this helps. Note: I am very comfortable to think open lines like moving average. There could be many moving averages but there is only one open line and there is no lag. We can forget the past and see when the month opened and where the price is now. Then if you are late try to catch up next week. Short when price goes below weekly open and the price is already below monthly open.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
3 wins today! working great so far, about 85% Win rate

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I place pending orders before major news; at previous day high/low without looking at monthly weekly open.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thank you fbird, it is also a completely other system what you take! =D But i find it very interesting; could you explain it more? For example; today there will come ppi-news, so for what pairs do you take a pending order? All crosses with USD? And your ratio is further 1:1 with 100 SL and 100 TP or other for special pairs like in the first post in this thread? So many questions, i hope you will answer me for all. =) Thank you

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi Sauderr, Yes, I acknowledge this is a different system and will stop posting if the OP require it. Baktesting the original system I noticed too many losses due to lack of follow through and that more often than not, TP was reached due to news. I am just forward testing here. To answer your questions, yes I will take all USD crosses with TP and SL as per post 1. Note that if the news result having low impact, you may be whippsawed, as this morning on GU. Cheers. Edit: USDCAD TP hit.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Congrats. Personally I got screwed. Had my pending sell at 1.0885 opened it at midnight EST. It got triggered 5 seconds before the news hit and instantaneously jumped up to take out my SL before heading down. The trade was both filled and closed for a loss at exactly 7:29:55. I'm guessing the infamous Oanda news-time widening spreads were the culprit. I'm kind of a newbie to this style of trading, anyone else experience this kind of thing?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hey Fbird, you had avioded your GBPUSD looser today, if you add the monthly-weekly-open-filter to your system. And your USDCAD would be so still a winner. I mean you only take one pending order for a pair; only in the direction of the monthly weekly open Perhaps a good development for your system?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I disagree. I had 4 other winners this week that were against weekly monthly open. Check trade explorer below. GU lost not because of trend direction but because the news release had a low impact on price. Do not forget this is kind of news trading.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
0815 result AUD/USD +5 pips USD/CAD +5 pips USD/CHF -8.7 pips *In my opinion, this is a great simple strategy. But we need to think about some points like opening timing and brokers. I use an Australian broker and I've tested a real account and a demo account. The demo account is going well so far but the real one is not same as the demo one even I've completely tried to trade both accounts. Because of slippage, sometimes the real one didn't open same timing. Sometimes it opened early even it didn't touch high or low point. Well, that can be only my situation and I just wanted to share my thinking and feeling. I'll keep watching this strategy and checking your idea and sharing. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #187 ---
is USDCAD safe to trade? So far i dont have a loss using EURUSD, GBPUSD and AUDUSD. using 5 pips takeprofit

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Did you trade this method?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
nice results, maybe 5 pips is better

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Yes. Live and demo are different. Reviewing the various news trading threads, can't find any good recommandation for news brokers. I have heard of an EA that actívate pending orders only if slippage and spread are under a certain range. Will try to investigate. This is clearly needed for this strategy in time of news release.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
i noticed the the default strategy, but just 5 pips TP Gives almost 85-90% Win Rate (On EurUsd, GbpUsd &amp; AudUsd Only). Since 5 pips is safe TP compared to projected 10pips. 5 pips also ensures the "BS" brokers do like high spreads. Therefore, maybe 5-7pips is best TP

Hi jeffray, i made a simple EA for this strategy, i'm not an expert in programing so it can be done by anyone, i can help you with that.. I made the EA to test 2 ways: Pending order per day from tuesday to friday, if the price is above or under the month and week opens like on the first post The other was at 4h candle with the same entries as for the day. I only started this week as a i came across the strategy last weekend, only testing on EU. the results for the 4h candles at this time is: 1 loss, 6 wins, 2 wins at 0.5pip. the stop loss is 20 pips, take profit 10 pips, at 5 pips profit it moves the stop to 0.5pips profit. Forgot to mention, 6 wins at 10pips, and more 2 wins at 0.5pips.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #225 ---
As far as my experience, use 10Pips SL FIXED, and 5-7pips TP Fixed

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hi Friends/Traders Indeed this is a good week, Also thanks for everyones contribution. I must say 5-7Pips is a hight probability target since there are times the gas runs out 2-3 Pip before TP's. More Trades to come, we just wait for them to set-up -Swilliam

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I appreciate your insights. Indeed like a moving average and does not Lag. With regards to MM, i prefer now to keep simple and accept a loss. Its a bit hard for me to add more than 1 position on a losing trade, i cant stomach it. But certainly others can do your suggestion if it better suites their strategy. Swilliam

Too bad I had my GBP/USD and EUR/USD lost 20 pips though I set my tp only 5 pips. What broker you using anyway?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
This week was good. Set sail on tuesday, Have a nice weekend to all

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hey all, I just started looking at this system and I'm using demo for it first. It just so happens that when I started it on Friday there was a loss for EURUSD/GBPUSD, profit on USDCHF, no trade for AUDUSD. I did some backtesting and the Tues-Thurs ones would have given profit. Just bad luck I guess

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thanks for backtesting, did you use TP 5 and SL 10 ? And do you mean there were only losses on Friday ? Thanks !

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I've been staying away from E/U and G/U as these seem to both be very oversold. I also stay away from set-ups where conditions would require me to set a buy limit in the .xx95 region or a sell limit in the .xx05 region. I think part of what determines your success with this (or any other system) is your willingness to take your foot off the gas when conditions aren't ideal.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
The closeness with the psychological level limit was the reason why I did not bother with the USD/JPY long scalp on Friday. Care to share the indicators that you use to determine whether the pairs are oversold or undersold?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I only had a look at last week's EURUSD and GBPUSD. Looks like ideal TP is 5-7 pips now. As for SL it did not really matter, for the losing trades you'd die either way. For the winning trades they did not cross the border at all, except for USDCHF on Friday. My problem with TP 5 and SL 10 is that you will need two wins for every loss. I'd go with TP7/SL7 - but again, I have not backtested this too much.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I just noticed 2hrs ago there was a dip in EUR/USD which would have triggered limit sells according to this system - you would have come out at a loss if you had set SL 5 or 10.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
EU was a loss if TP=10 Pips but it was a winner if TP=5 Pips Swilliam

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yes you are correct

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Changed my TP to pip, might try 7pip also. Winnings so far: EJ +5 NZ +5 UC +5 EU +5

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Great thread. Thanks for sharing swilliam and everyone else. I've backtested manually a month or so on all 4 pairs and filtering till 1 hour before Euro open definitely decreases the losses. So for me being in Australia I will only add my orders around 3pm. If PA is already past that point then I am betting on a pullback otherwise I cant enter. Also adding the 2nd trade the same as the 1st if the 1st fails but doubling the TP increases wins and cancels out some of the losses. Once I get a few weeks forward testing under my belt I intend to add some rules to help let winners go on to be bigger winners but I appreciate the simplicity of the in and out quickly goal swilliam aims for.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
so 5-7 pip TP and 7 pip SL would be best?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
what is your stop loss

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I don't currently use an indicator for overbought/oversold. I just look out for price consolidation after a lengthy trend. Look at the chart of E/U from 8/5 to 8/18. I commited to not taking any trades until price broke that 1.3335 support.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I see. Thanks for the insight. As for today's update early Tokyo session - looks like a +7pip on E/U, but a loss on G/U (SL hit) and a potential loss on U/C (SL not hit yet). A/U has no trades today. Looks like it would be best to only commence the pending trades after London opens as per what marshalmax stated - i.e. treating London open as the start of a new day.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Started off as a good day with +7 pip wins EU &amp; EJ but GJ &amp; GU have been a loss, may put in a second entry at the london open. Still have UC open also.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Same trades i took with the same results.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I just noticed that the potential E/U short and U/C long for the London open are at very high peaks and lows - swilliam would these be considerations as to whether a pending trade should be entered?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
will gmt offset affect the results?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
2 losses this morning during the Euro session: Buy A/U... -15 pips Buy A/J... -15 pips The funny thing is I had concerns about opening both these orders. There was a point of historical resistance dangerously close to my quote on A/U and on A/J the prior day had only just barely closed above the monthly open. The lesson to take from this: quality over quantity. In my opinion, it's not wise to open an order for every daily close that meets the basic conditions. It pays to be judicious

--- 帖子 #256 ---
My AUDUSD yesterday was an easy 10pips win. Trade was triggered on Asia session https://charts.mql5.com/5/559/audusd...al-markets.png https://charts.mql5.com/5/559/audusd...al-markets.png

--- 帖子 #257 ---
AUDUSD EURUSD &amp; GBPUSD, 7 pips SL &amp; TP maybe better than 10. You will only know once you did forward testing Swilliam

--- 帖子 #258 ---
for me 7 pips works better so far.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
If you set the AUDUSD trade for the London session instead (like I did), it hit SL, would not have mattered even if it was set at 5 pips TP.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
i think in AUDUSD, Asia session is better. Since AUD is volatile on Asia session and also volatility form news. Maybe this is best AUDUSD , Asia Session GBPUSD &amp; EURUSD &amp; USDCHF in london session. But now i stick with the rules, no session filter needed and trade 1st breakout only . and it was a good week for 7 pips. i use pepperstone broker.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Agree. Forward testing is the only way to know.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Trading starts on tuesday Happy weekend guys

--- 帖子 #263 ---
My stop loss is 10 pip, I also have been using RSI and Stock along with my SL. If I am in negative and using RSI, Stock and support and resist if it doesn't look like it will turn around I will exit early to save from further losses.

I had a loss on usd/chf today, personally. Do you trade Asian or Euro session, SWilliam?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
This is the result of last month. EU, GU, AU - tp 10pips, sl 10pips UChf, UCad, NU - tp 7 pips, sl 7pips. I missed some trades because It trigged at midnight. I demo on ICmarket with ECN account. Total 54 trades : win 36 trades, loss 18 trades. If risk 1%/trade ==&gt; 18%/month (include commission and spead) ==&gt; awesome. This month I start with very small live account because there are some different between live and demo. Hope a good result at the end of this month! Thanks Swilliam and friends!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Sorry to ask but, didn't the price of today on EurUsd ( 2/09 ) was above month and week ? is it a server time problem, maybe ? i only had a win on UsdChf, all the other pairs, the pendings didn't came active.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
This may be similar

--- 帖子 #271 ---
ow sorry for that, ty for correcting. I was testing another approach and got mixed up. Only USDCHF was triggered

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Right, ty for bringing up. Only USDCHF was triggered, i got mixed up using another method

So today it already start, 4 trigger, 3 loss 1 win. Pairs i'm testing, EU, GU, AU, UC the same from the first post and EJ, EG, all with 6 pips stop and profit. So for this week, i'm in red, 4 loss 2 wins. Only 1 of the losses isn't the recomended pairs.

So i believe that your broker is really diferent from mine, EU not trigger, lost on AU &amp; GU.. lost on 6 pips and also on 10 pips. what was your price on the open of 09/4 ?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Loss yesterday on UJ -10pip AJ -10pip win on EU +7pip AU +7pip 14pip up and 20pip down means yesterday was a loss. So I did some looking through the charts and I'm thinking that the first week of the month may not be a good time to trade using this indicator. At the beggining of every month the two lines come together and you don't get a clear indication of buy or sell in come cases. It might be worth while to give the first week of every month a miss using this method and just start trading on the second week of the month once the lines seperate again.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
EU sell yesterday, i just place 7Pips SL then afterwards, im up 60 Pips with 7 pips stop

do you have a test without using JPY crosses? JPY seems not to be good as 7-10 pips is easily taken on spread and whipsaws

No at the moment I just have the 1 test. I might play with the stop loss for the JPY crosses maybe and see what I can come up with.

Hi Swilliam and Everyone-else, First, thanks so much for sharing this trading idea Swilliam. There is about 5 Billion (joking) ideas posted on this forum, some good, others not so good (in my opinion: for example, one scalping method does not have a SL?). The Open Scalping Strategy is appealing to me as no special indicators are needed. (I don't have MT4 or anything like it, just the broker's web-based platform.) It is very simple to understand and use. First trade [demo]: Win UJ +10pips (10pip SL) [Aussie/Asia session] : the win was never in doubt I also tried an index : Win Aussie Cash 200 +10points (10points SL) : again, never in doubt (over some RED news) Just some general comments: looking at some losing trades and comparing to winners, either the win is hardly ever in doubt and executed (relatively) quickly or the price action whips around and in the to'n and fro'n the entry is hit along with the SL. If this is the case more often than not then the strength of the strategy could be based on a number of factors: where the entry actually is (we hope this is true!), the session(s) traded over and the amount of pips we demand over the number the market wants to give us (gone within a blink of an eye it seems, if we are greedy). The last two factors have room for refining, as everyone has been doing...great job and thank you! Following Swilliam, I'm using fixed TP &amp; SL with as close to 1:1 Risk:R as possible (no point in going 2:1 if the above observations are close to correct IMO). Griff

Hi ChrisGC, great idea with multiple entries. I tried the same idea during the London session yesterday; Loss UCAD -10pips : hit entry, then RED news, then hit SL Win UCAD +5pips : 2nd entry (waited until it got around 3-5 pips below first SL - reload) then it hit 2nd entry followed by TP very quickly I was close to BE but I had two previous wins. I should say Mikajap is absolutely correct at this stage we are only testing. If our stats show that this is a good method then you can decide for yourself if going live is a good idea. What I'm trying to do is find the sweet spot(s) - when to trade and number of pips. Update: UCAD +6pips (this was the 2nd entry - missed 1st which was a loss anyway) : staggered up but got there easily in the end UCAD +10pips (this was the 3rd entry) : just on RED news, hit TP very quickly Watch out on NU - looks like its headed for major support? Bounced strong (15M TF) off lows (roughly) against RED news (Griff scratches head ) Seems like the same story with EU? Same general patterns on D TF. If they start retracing then just watch? NU +4pips (this was the 3rd entry for the day but I didn't like the first two) : price action looked good here but risky stuff ATR(24)=8 on the 15M so went for 4pips - turns out could have done better but still 1:1 R:R. Both NU &amp; EU are giving me symmetric triangles with false breaks to the wrong side and then breakouts to the entry which seems to be strong price action for this method. On the flip side we are majorly oversold near major support (Griff continues to scratch head ) UCAD : valid 4th entry since price action came back to 10pip SL (my original 2nd entry trade) and then would have hit TP again(!) but I was too busy looking at NU. Also, it looked a bit exhausted to me - this is a tough job Ok, traders that's it for me - please keep trading the method through Mondays and the first week of month as we need the info (for those of us who are testing, of course)

hi, so on these results, what SL is used? these are all max profit, it would be a good baseline to get an average target.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Some comments on the above three previous MN : 1. The first W of MN should not be invalidated 2. Mondays seems likely to be a no trade day - needs more checking 3. Strategy inherently stops trading during periods of indecision (on the MN TF - candle-stick-wise) 4. Triggers during trend (MN TF) but stops trading on D consolidations These are all just (somewhat crude) guesses based on what I can see off the above numbers. The way I see it, you could approach this in one of two ways: as a turtle or use of some supplementary information supporting discretion. I have no idea which, if any?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi moneybill, Thank you for your question. This is a scalping strategy so people have been trying various TP &amp; SL's with varying R:R. One of the discussions suggested that a 1:1 Risk:R would be no different to a 2:1 since the SL was hit on a losing trades regardless. If, after testing, this appears to hold true on average it would make sense to try and stick to a 1:1 R:R as close as possible. So, in the above MN summaries, I did not state particular SL &amp; TP settings (apart from extreme values). For explicit numbers see above for peoples trading examples. You get the feeling that a typical TP ~ 7pips with a SL anywhere b\w 7 to 15(?) pips. This is all speculation at this stage and may remain that way. One possible technique would be to use the ATR(?) (on the entry TF, 15M say) as a measure of noise.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
ECHF +6pips with 6pip TS [2nd entry around the London open. 1st entry price action looked sluggish and was in the Asia session]. There was a bullish converging trend channel breakout that won the trade for us but this happened after entry was triggered so a bit risky [see image].

--- 帖子 #320 ---
It is observed that people here do not post their trading picture. It is easy to say I won 3 trades and lost 1. But when you post your trade picture, it will help others build their trading confidence.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
EU and UCHF - candidates ... pairs appear oppositely correlated, price action / trend UCHF -10pips (10pip TS) [false break from parallel bullish trend lines (15M TF), triggered entry then slowly sank to SL - never looked like a win]

The Trade Explorer in my signature is my demo account I use for trading this method and it's a public one so feel free to have a look at all the trades I've done. I'm just lazy posting up charts lol

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Great comment reeeen4! Your doing extremely well too.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Right, im also lazy posting the charts. But so far weekly results are good. using 7 TP SL.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Your findings are very helpful. basing from the data, 7 pips maybe a good approximation. for me 1:1 should be done as much as possible

--- 帖子 #326 ---
your findings are very helpful! keep us posted

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Thanks Yeah I think 7 pips seems to be working well but I agree that it probably should be kept to 1:1 I've been testing with a 10pip SL and I think it's not working too great.... it means even if I get 2 or three wins all it takes is 1 loss and most of the winnings are gone. In a month I might start testing certain pairs just at the London open and see how that goes might get less losses.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
GU +5pips (6pip TS) [ Happen in a flash. Could have done a bit better but ATR(14)=6 and we were at the lower end of bearish parallel trend lines (15M TF). Actually, it was a breakout to the entry but it all happen too fast. Asian session ]

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Normally traders aim for 1:4 (Risk:R) or better so even if they are technically losing on average per trade their money management will make them win in the end (when ever the end may be). With scalping methods you are turning that around. However, IMO, anything with less than 1:1 is not sustainable. If you have 1:1 and 60% win say (which is remarkable in its own right) then it could possibly work. So, when ever I see strategies that rely on huge R:R against the trader (in some cases no SL strategy at all) then I immediately reject these. update: Just looking at the GU trade, it could be a good idea in the future to implement a stop-runner money management strategy which would improve R:R. That is you could TP 75% on the fixed target, reset the SL to BE and let 25% run with a TS? Perhaps automating this in MT4 or similar would be the way to go. However, this would also require a counter strategy - simply downsizing risk @ 75% of SL should things go bad.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Candidates coming into the London session: EU - looking ok on the D UCHF - looking sluggish / consolidating on the D [ could be forming a bullish flag-pole? ] The above pairs are locally well (oppositely) correlated but EU has produced less losses ECHF - looking good on the D GU - is still going strong with +41pips (Griff wipes tears ) and counting... but is now a [no trade]

--- 帖子 #331 ---
are you trading it in all pairs? what rules do you use?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Just from the Major pairs but I seem to hover around EU / ECHF / GU / UCHF / EG. Also, its possible to look at any product with a low spread, like Major Indices. If the spread become too large then its not possible / viable... Simple rules : if the price action is sluggish around the entry take the ATR(14) value as target (unless this value is not practical). Otherwise take 2X ATR(14). To decide if a move is strong look at the local trend on the 15M TF - is it a breakout, extension, double bottom / top, etc [ side note: if the entry in near a (psychological) 00-number you may wish too supersede the 1-tick rule in favor of a better entry price. This needs some more observation as there is a lot going on near the entry ]

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Everything is looking a little flat at the moment (pair-wise)... Keeping an eye on EU &amp; UCHF as they are (oppositely) correlated with strength dependent upon consolidation of ECHF Aussie Cash 200 (Fixed) +6points@75% (7points TS) + (Runner) 15points@25% (BE SL) : never in doubt, strong fundamentals, strong price action [ATR(14)=7 on 15M TF] Just a re-think, runners usually work better if you go for at least 1:3 (with respect to the overall risk - what you started with) [Side note: the re-entry strategy is apart of swilliam's original proposal, I forgot how detailed the original was]

--- 帖子 #334 ---
no setups yet so far, waiting for a possible trigger on EU

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi, your results are very helpfull. I also agree that there should be 1:1 risk reward, So the balance to TP and SL is key. 7pips can be a good set and forget. But like other said and told me, you can increase TP. This will depend of you think the setups can give more profits like news setups, breakout of trading range or inside days Swilliam

--- 帖子 #336 ---
ECHF - no trade by rules - came up fast but its weakly correlated with UCHF it seems, which is a possibility (although not a candidate price-wise - too far from entry at the moment) RED News could shake things up...

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Things looked good over the NY session (yesterday), setups for EU, ECHF &amp; UCHF, but I missed it all... anyone get anything? UJ was a sure win. Aussie Cash 200 (Fixed) +8points (8points TS) : never in doubt [Asian session] Keep an eye on EU [NU could follow] - looking for a breakout of [local] bearish flag-pole

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Think about it, a 65-70% win result on average is phenomenal... when testing I keep in mind that the conditions we are experiencing in the market are going to change. For example, the volatility is down currently and this will, in all likelihood, change in the future. So, the question is how will the strategy fair in future conditions? I always worry when a certain system is claimed to have x% success. What does that mean? For example, if its based on back-testing then it is true for the market conditions experienced of the back-tested data. IMO the success % is more like a changing estimate which can go either way.

It is still good, but I guess I try to aim as high as possible... the least amount of looses the better. I completely agree that's why when trading I try be as flexible as possible and go with the market. I'm going for what works right now, I am using all my strategies and everything I have learnt together and developing my own methods for my live account. Hopefully I can change with the market or if my methods no longer work I'll take a step back reassess and change. This is a great strategy but on it's own I think it has it's limits and needs to be developed more. In this current market it seems to working pretty well so far but I personally think it's still too early to tell.

This sounds like a winning approach to trading!!!

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Just noticed 'strange' price action in the NY session on a number of pairs... see images below... This looks like the 'worst case scenario' for the strategy. Some analysts refer to this as harmonic convergence of prices action. If the level to which the price action is converging is the previous days low/high (the entry) then the strategy is in trouble. There were other pairs where this also happened but they were not converging on the entry price. EU (0 wins and 3 losses - quick, chippy price action) and UJ (1 win and 1 loss - more steady price action) : -23pip loss

Hi, when in doubt do not trade, be good

--- 帖子 #346 ---
yes, this system is good but needs testing. I only prefer 1 trade, 1 win/1loss. No adding trades yet. But will look on it

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I agree, this is an important aspect of the strategy to focus on during testing. Of course, when viewing the D TF there appears to be only one entry and associated outcome. However, the strategy is really defined at a TF in the order of the scalping price targets, say 15M TF. But, on this TF the single entry signal on the D TF becomes (possibly) multiple entry signals. Actually, this requires some thought as what we are really saying (hoping perhaps) is that there is causality between the two TF events: if there is a win on the D TF. However, there is the possibility that an overall loss can occur even though the D TF indicates a win. For example, the 1st entry on the 15M TF could be a loss while the 2nd is a win and therefore the D TF shows a win. If we are only to take the first entry then this would result in a loss. (the best time to lose is during testing while its a win - the prize being information)

Got the same thing happening with EU -9 pips (10pip SL) : the same general pattern / behavior as noted above. It's like dipping your toe in boiling hot water... ouch! AU +9pips (10pip SL) : strong winner

Trading starts tomorrow, may there be successful breakouts Swilliam

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I tried this system only 2 weeks or so (not enough !) ... mixed results, sometimes it seems working - then I got SL's ! So is here someone with a broader experience ? At least for a continous period of some weeks ? This thingy looks really pretty easy - it would be great to see it working in a longer run.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
no triggered trades yet

--- 帖子 #353 ---
AU +9pips GJ +23pips NU +9pips SL close to 1:1 as possible (they always take a bit more than they give anyway). All strong moves. Set and forget - I had a cooking class to go to. Mondays seems to be always (or near enough) bad, confirming swilliam's original rule (Griff hates Mondays ). I'm keeping an eye on Fridays late.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
there was an audusd trade. i prefer not to trade on monday(1st day) also because of low volatility. false breakouts often happen during 1st days. good luck to your cooking class

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Great observation for this method swilliam - I always like to confirm things from testing. UCHF -10pips - only gave 3pips before crashing - possible 2nd entry EU - still looks bad - waters still boiling hot

EG +10pips : strong move [London session] EU &amp; AU &amp; UJ &amp; UCHF (&gt;6pip SL) : all worked but I was too busy [London calling] did anyone get these or others?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Candidates for London open... UCHF UJ GJ EG EU NU - change of polarity @ entry ? AU - might be following or crack &amp; snap ? ... crack &amp; snap it is ... now waiting for (possible) re-entries NU +6pips : strong move after crack &amp; snap : "...show me the pip-age!" Tom 'Forex' Cruise NU &amp; AU strongly correlated here, NU just happened to break-out at the right time-price - looking @ NY open - watching for the poker playing ladder boys... Ok, NU looking like breaking D1 lows... dragging AU with it... done! (note: runner on NU would have gotten +30pips ~ 1:3) Now, looking for entry... AU +7pips : strong quick move, dragged down by NU (the best indi, like, ever!)

--- 帖子 #358 ---
How did everyone do? EU +6pips : quick strong move (looks like there was 3 chances to get this) : Royal Flush ! [could have done better, on everything actually but can't be greedy - 'Market Karma' hunts the greedy] ECHF is coming up, but running out of time - don't like the tail end of the US session once London is gone... ok, I've been triggered, it went up and touched my TP @ 5pips but no execution... hovering around entry, not looking good... looks like its double-topping with a shake-out candle (shooting star, 15M TF)... yep, classic shooting star - nope, taken out ECHF -5pips : touched my TP, which I lowered to 5pips due to increase in risk, but didn't trigger then formed a shooting star which was comfirmed by next 15M candle that hit SL Market to Griff : stop trading ! AU +5pips : strong move down [could have gotten 11pips easy] . Oh no!, I'm addicted to trading ECHF - 2nd entry - stalled, could go either way - got TP @ high of previous shooting star - manual close this time, if required. Price action looks bad UJ - coming up strong - looking for a break-out into the trigger ECHF -7pips : hit entry then simply came back to SL Griff sweats, knows time is running out fast...

Great results Steef! Well done My UJ is still pending... [of course, shouldn't be trading at that time (see above for comments on 'strange' price action) but like to test everything to the extreme...] UJ +19pips : looked strong in the end (side note: Aust 200 +10points : so far haven't got a loss since trading this, quite amazing)

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Keep going Mikajap you're doing great, collect all the information you can during your testing

--- 帖子 #363 ---
EJ looks like it could come back to trade (a reversal - morning star type pattern forming)? GU looks good aswell to come back to trade? ECHF, EG is no trade GJ - l don't like the look of this (huge shooting star on D1 and could roll over and become no trade?) - wait till later in week? All other major dollar pairs looking strong? Anyone spot anything of interest? I generally look at all majors with low spread.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
ECHF, EG still no trade but plenty of candidates going into the London open GJ coming on strong... [Griff watching 1H TF ... looks like a range but price only has to break to the high end ... Red News] EU ... [Griff watching for a break of the WO... engulfing a shooting star price broke the WO but now need a close below to confirm] NU ... [Griff watching a nice reversal, harami followed by shooting star... mmm heading into yearly lows ]

EU +9pips : strong move down [first surge of the long candle would have hit SL I think but by the time I executed the order it came back and hit entry then TP] UCHF +8pips : super strong move (Red News... Bang!) Could have done much better on everything GU +8pips : broke the 1.62000 psychological / round number then surged to TP. Scary as bounced off level maybe 4 or 5 times. This just broke down +20pips UCAD +7pips : direct steady move up to TP [could have done a bit better but still great stuff ] UJ ... I'm in and lookiing steady...got to 7pips but still looking good...going for 14pips...ATR(14)=7pips on 15M TF...broke 109.800...rebound off this level...broke back and looking good...we want just below .900...came back and bounced off .800 wow! New 15M candle hit new high by 2 ticks (1/5th of a pip)...bouncing off .800 level again, so set SL to BE (if it wants to come back down I don't want to know about it)...ok hit BE ... I'm stuffed c'yas hope everyone did well.

No entry's hit yet today for me

--- 帖子 #367 ---
AU was a possibility during Asian session - looks like anything better than a 8pip SL would have been ok [looks like Red News caused this] My bad - just noticed that its a new month! So, this is against the rules! [Aust 200 +12points : got in too early (pre-open) and got hit with a wide spread (ouch!) - otherwise a strong move down, it got to +18points from entry]

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Mmmm ... notice that the system reversed signals on pairs like EU, AU &amp; NU that where all @ major S&amp;R levels... interesting GJ, EJ, EG, ECHF, EU, UCAD, UCHF, GU, NU --- No Trade status AU ... online, trade-able...have a look at the 1H TF [Griff takes a pass ] This is what traders have observed (see previous posts) about the start of new month - the system is adjusting / updating and will produce less trades as a result ...

Bad day GU SL-10 GJ SL-10 AU TP +5 EJ SL-10 EU No trade yet UC No trade yet A trailing stop would be a good idea, but is difficult to backtest for me.

Actually, perhaps that's the best idea...

Thanks for the information Steef. I think what is happening is that the system is going through an adjustment phase and perhaps this reflects your findings? It will be very interesting to see how things turnout.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
UJ +7pips [Asian session]: nice inverted cup&amp;handle on the 1H TF ... strong move, break down, across the entry [of course, could have done better currently +30pips] GJ - would have worked @ 7pips TP and at least this for SL GJ -7pips : 2nd entry [Tokyo session] : massive slippage here but no Red News (did I miss something? Cross checked 1H charts. Mmmm... a vacuum cleaner perhaps...here is a possibility http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&amp;id=506809 ... to add to confusion, as you know, sometimes Red News goes by unnoticed...take it on the chin, stiff upper lip and carry on...)

First few days of the month I'm holding out until Monday to start trading again.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I think that would be a good amendment to the rules... today has been all over the place and the system is adjusting... [side note: Sing 30 : had it set for 7points and it would have slowing, very slowly, worked... never toke it too busy....I'm in the UK 100 but just adjusted SL's to BE, setup a 50/50 order as above, went for 11points which looks like too much for first 50% risk... up 5points or so...if I realize I've been too greedy I set to BE and see what happens... I'm out BE, could have gotten 8points]

This is the result of September with live account. ECN of IC Market. 22 win and 21 loss. Hope a better result next month. Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi Linhpip, thanks so very much for the data and congratulations on the results so far - this is very informative &amp; encouraging. I'm comparing your two results (the other from a demo from Aug). Your gains are significantly higher than your losses given all things equal. This is a great result! I can tell you that my statistics have improved from week to week so maybe the more I practice and gain experience the better my results? (Of course, there's always the other side of the equation -&gt; the market!) I think that this may also be true for other traders here as there has been mention of 65% winning results and better! I suspect 65% win will be the sweat spot for this system, IMO. That is a phenomenal statistic - think about it!

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Final trades (on the side) before finishing up... UK100 +9point : quick move down (TP Manually cause I'm stuffed! ) US 30 +18points : again, quick move down (TP Manually cause I'm really stuffed! )

AU, NU, UJ, GJ, ECHF, EG --- status is Trade EU, UCAD, EG, UCHF, EJ, GU --- status is No Trade Please cross check these ... Technically, it is still within the rules to trade @ the 1st week of the month but since the opens are likely to be within +- 4 x ADR, say, its like the system is indicating a consolidation stage (this may or may not be the case with regard to price action). In the light of linhpip's results this is a very important issue for the system. Any opinions or comments would be most welcome.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi Linhpip, how many trades per day (on average)? The reason I ask, looking at your graph, is the perceived bias as the month continues --- better results latter in the month. This would hold true with what traders have been saying about the first week of the month. Did you change anything of significance as you traded each day?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
EG -5pips : never looked good --- double top (tightened my SL from 8pips) [Mmmm...historically, the double tops have peaked on the 2nd top (1H TF), so a 2nd entry would be the go] ECHF is close to entry but the price action can only be described as disgustingly lethargic ECHF -[Too Many]pips SL (who knows how many pips? A lot!) Just noticed that there is a 4pip difference between different data - the 5M candle (an enormous spinning top) that took me out doesn't show up when compared to other data... Mmmm... started to diverge (spread!) a few 5M candles before the news [all the more reason to stay out] Have a great weekend everyone ...

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Just some statistics so far: Week 3 (22092014) of Sep: +25.3pips of possible 171.1pips with efficiency* 14.79% : 9 winners and 9 losers and 0 BE : negative profits Week 4 (29092014) of Sep/Oct (Not including Fri**): +76.76 pips of possible 242pips with efficiency 31.72% : 5 winners and 1 loser and 2 BE : positive profits Comments: I was employing a volatility based risk/money management method in Week 3 which resulted in a significant loss even though it was a 50% win result. When I changed this to a fixed risk model things improved. *Note: efficiency is something that I have made-up (I think?) : it is defined by using the estimate of the number of pips from entry to the first swing point or, rather, fractal (B. Williams) as the 'possible' number of pips. **Note: if I include the 2 losses from Friday I would need to get a new bank loan

Brief Summary of Trader's Results and Comments: specific to win % Fbird : reported a series of results including 2nd entries, comparing London, Frankfurt and Tokyo sessions. The Franfurt open proved to be the most successful ( around 70% win using AU, UCHF, GU, EU, NU over Mar-July) Swilliam : reports win% around 70% using 1:1 Risk reward on the pairs EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, with USDCHF as a second priority Linhpip : confirmed Fbird's &amp; Swilliam's results by presenting details of demo results over Aug: (EU, GU, AU - tp 10pips, sl 10pips and UChf, UCad, NU - tp 7 pips, sl 7pips) win 36 trades, loss 18 trades = 66.67% win Nico1359 : finds that reducing the TP to 5 pips increses significantly the win% to a highest estiamte of 88% AU from Jan to Aug 7. "Keeping the SL at 15 means risk/reward ratio of 3:1" Reeeen4 : reports 65.6% win on demo account Alphac: pointed out that from 17th July until Aug 5th, GU resulted in 7wins / 17trades = 41.18%. His/her conclusion was "Looking back at this 'system' it only manages 50% at best." Linhpip : recently confirmed Alphac's observation on a live account producing 22 win and 21 loss = 51.16% win [Thank you to my fellow traders for all this information. If I have missed something then please let me know, thanks!]

Thanks griffinssoul for your summarizing analysis ! I like it ! So what do we have now ? Does this simple trading approach give a chance to win in a longer run ? Its not so clear so far - although we have quite enough votes "pro" ... but at the end of griffinssoul's post I read, that the winning rate isn't the best ?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Thanks for your comments and questions, DerBerliner. I've been thinking about this question: if you have (set) binary rules based on OCHL for Buy and Sell can they produce bias over N trades as N becomes large (where the term large means, say, over an Elliot Wave Cycle on the traded TF). The answer must surely be NO! So, from this perspective I believe the conclusion of Alphac is correct. However(!), and this is the million dollar question ( ), is there a bias in the temporal aspect of the set rules? Notice that the rules are defined in terms of price only (granted, there is explicit mention of 1D, 1W &amp; 1MN TF but the rules are in a sense independent, e.g. there is nothing special about Jan or the 14th W of 2014, etc). To answer this we have a big clue in Linhpip's traded chart (I think, we need more information). There appears to be distinct "temporal" bias in the chart as shown (see images). I have to make many assumptions which may invalidate this observation but it looks to coincide with the first week of the month? If true, the temporal bias could counter the price equilibrium over a large enough number of trades. Yet, on the other hand, this could prove to be just an anomaly but previous comments of traders support this view. There are other aspects of the system that need mention, like the timing involved in setting/executing an order, should it be done when the new 1D candle starts or wait until a particular session? Fbird's findings suggest the latter. First chart is from Linhpip's real trading account for the MN while the second is from the demo account

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I am not sure it will profitable or not but must I will test it in my cent account first.Because I never be serious with demo account. My interesting trading

Ok, traders, here we go --- the 2nd week coming off a new month heading for Tue AU &amp; UCAD have already setup - things to note: both @ major 1D support (typically, we are faced with false-breaks / break-outs or rebounds: very hard to deduce the consequences for this strategy). Both pairs are heading towards major round numbers: AU -&gt; 0.86000 &amp; UCAD -&gt; 1.13000. Now, one thing I have learned from Udine's ( ) thread (As simple as possible: 00 level trading) is the importance of the 00-levels. Udline exploits their "magnetic" attraction of price action in his method and we could possibly benefit from this here. There seems to be enough pip-age to these levels to grab a fist full of them.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
EJ, GU, UCHF --- No Trade, UJ is also a No Trade IMO cause opens are too close NU : bouncing off strong 1D support - if 2nd bounce then good for this method --- ranging on the 1H AU : same as NU --- expanding triangle on the 1H, plenty of room to move into upstairs UCAD : kind of inverted version of NU &amp; AU --- keeping it tight as entry is around 10 pips away from support 'line' on 1D TF EU : same general form as UCAD but looks like a bit of a break out on the 1D --- Mmmm, on the 1H TF not looking good, needs to double top false-break-out for this method(?) EG : coming up to resistance on the 1D TF, Mmmm not sure, on the 1H we had a change of polarity around 22nd Sep, a retest false-break-out and now we are back at that level --- our entry! ECHF : massive gap with this one which was quickly filled on the 1H TF --- our entry is resistance formerly a strong support level GJ : same type of situation as ECHF but heading towards support

--- 帖子 #391 ---
GJ &amp; AU would have both lost on Asian session with SL &lt; around 10pips it looks like... [London calling] GJ --- 2nd entry looking better...only gave 9pips... AU looks like it could spring up for 2nd entry (yes, sprang up and lost its spring...LOL)... waiting game for London NU --- creeping up, could turn before coming back for London

AU +8pips TP (SL 11pips) : got in at the 3rd entry but it was strong all the way ECHF -8pips SL : big green candle over 15M went up hit entry then next candle came down hit SL (way over extended perhaps) GJ +8pips TP (8pip SL) : 3rd entry, missed 1st &amp; 2nd (would have both won ) AU +7pips TP (7pip SL) 3rd entry : nice break-out of a 3-wave correction to a bullish 5-wave impulse - strong stuff and I put a runner on it with a BE SL - still going (free pip-age) : ok I closed the runner +7pips too stuffed to wait...

Hi Griffinssoul, English isn't my language, so maybe I can't understand clearly your post. In August, I demo on ICmarket with very good result. (chart second). I place pending order at the morning, 7am (I'm in 7+GMT). If I miss a trade (it tped or sled) I will ignore it. If not I'll place a buy limit or sell limit. And I close all pending order at 10pm. It's sleeping time. In September (the first chart), I trade live on ICmarket ECN with the same rule in August. With trade live, If the trade trigger, it's usually add slippage so the result isn't good like on demo. Hope you understand. ) Trade Well.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Thank you very much Linhpip - I understand exactly what you mean. How many trades did you make in the first week of each month? The reason I ask about the first week is that maybe it is not good for this system to trade in the first week of the month.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
GJ +10pips X 2 : 1st and 2nd entries EU &amp; EJ's candidates, UJ opens really close? That's it for me traders, hope everyone did great,

--- 帖子 #396 ---
UCad +7pips [London open] : this looks like it was the 2nd entry but the first was in the Asian session : looks like its got a 3rd entry in it maybe? EU would have worked for SL&gt;9pips (TP was max 17pips) but it was before the London open (might be 2nd entry?) UJ would have worked for SL&gt;7pips (TP was max 13pips) UChf had 3 entries before London open UJ +10pips [London session] : solid move down, leading up to Red News, 2nd entry UCad -7pips SL [London session] : only gave 3.5 pips before heading north

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Just a few ideas, comments, observations and a description of my concept of a SL zone that I use to quickly estimate SL and possibly identify strengths and weaknesses of a given trade. First, I have introduced a statistic in my journal associated with the 1MN &amp; 1W opens and the colors of the previous day and current day candle (should it trigger the trade) and all their relative positions. By the rules of this strategy all this information can be written in a compact form, e.g. M:W:G:R (the first two letters denote the Month and Week opens while the last two denote the colors of the candles) would denote a Sell trade with the previous low (previous day candle) given by a Green candle which is below the Weekly open, the Weekly open below the Monthly open. Using this one could quickly compare a WMGR with a MWRR trade etc. I have spent a bit of time trading Udine's 00-level method (see thread here on FF) in the hope of gaining some insight into RN/BRN trading. This was a great experience and I learned a lot which will benefit this method, I think. For example, if price action is approaching a BRN from lower prices then if our entry is at a .900-level for a Buy trade this would be opposed to BRN trading rules etc. Just an observation about comparing the Tokyo open to the London open: if the entry is triggered at the Tokyo open (win or lose) and is rejected strongly it may well come back strongly in the London open and be a good trade? I'm keeping an eye on this - the "Tokyo dip". Finally, I have made up a SL method: on the 1H I draw a zone (I use a box shape thing) from the entry point to 3 horizontal touches of (3) candles including (at least one Close). Pulling the box to the right creates the "SL zone". In the case of a Sell trade if this zone is previous S&amp;R then I have found it is more likely that the (current days) price action will visit the SL zone. If their is consolidation (to the left of the SL zone from the entry) through the SL zone then I expect turbulence. (I place my SL near top of this zone for a Sell trade). Side Note: in some setups there is a huge wick/shadow (doji, hammer etc) making the SL impractical. In this case I just drop to the 15M TF.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
GJ -16 SL (1st entry) then +15 TP (2nd entry) : even Steven : so close! : gave 4.5 pips before retracing fast to SL (just got to SL) then 2nd entry went down to TP before a few brief re-traces. There was an approach to the entry, rejected strong, at the Tokyo open (within 20pips). SL zone was strong previous S&amp;R on the 1H TF. This was a MWRR trade. An automated SL procedure whereby the SL moves to around (?) entry would have great benefits in scenarios like this as bounces are inevitable/expected. (Also good idea to place a runner as currently @ 75pips ( ) and dropping. (Again, would be good to automate a procedure as when this happens it yields better R:R.) EJ +10pips (+12pip SL) : using GJ as an indi basically, (correlated), straight down no problems - what I was hoping GJ would do. There was also an approach to the entry, rejected strong, at the Tokyo open (within a few pips). This was a MWRR trade.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Ok, that's it for me! This week was great! More trades than last week but less win% but no complaints! (Note: EG is coming up, looks over extended and no "Tokyo dip". A MWRG trade.) 9 wins &amp; 3 lose, 52pips, efficiency = 24.42% Have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #400 ---
NU, EU, UCad, UChf all have very close opens (1MN &amp; 1W TF) with respect to ATR(14) --- consolidating UJ, GU, GJ, EJ are No Trade EG (MWRG), EChf (MWRG) are setup but 1 x ATR from trigger

--- 帖子 #401 ---
back to trading guys, very nice results griff

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Thanks swilliam! One thing I've noticed with some threads here on FF is that they quickly deviate from the initial objective and proposed strategy. So, I have made it a point to leave unchanged the core rules as you defined on page 1. All the refinements suggested have been to enhance and fine tune the win% with respect to time filters and monitoring of statistics. Let me know if you think otherwise.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Ok, here we go! Got multiple setups - watch those BRN, NU&amp;AU - had Tokyo dips (wins) on both. AU looks tough... a .900-level long into a BRN... EU, UJ, UChf, EG, GJ candidates I'm taking a pass on AU - ( 5th wave of 5-wave move wave-3 isn't the longest in price? could be correction?) needs extension (or the B of the ABC?) + BRN (its a WMGG trade) GJ - grappling with BRN which is above the entry (MWRR trade with no Tokyo dip) Everything is pulling back to the W/M opens - hang tough

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Good and bad news there ... bad was I dialed in the SL incorrectly on GJ 12ticks(!!! Son of a @##$% !!!), couldn't change it in time , no harm done (it only went south, like, 5billion pips!). Good news, EG +8pips (MWGG trade) in a millisecond That should have been two wins but sometimes you lose without even getting out of bed UJ is up but the water is too muddy... Ok, Griff, would you like to take home your pips or risk them for a chance to get even more shinny green pips... ummm, I'll take these ones home please

hi grif so far this system works well, what method would you suggest to improve it? can you explain it on a step by step. extra filters would reduce trades, but increase win rate ty mika

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi Mikajap, I totally agree! Swilliam has come up with a brilliant trading strategy - its like the market comes to you instead of you chasing the market. I say brilliant because its one of the simplest strategies I've seen yet powerful, perhaps because of its simplicity(?). Something really unique and (somewhat) strange happens as PA approaches the entry. It is important not to change any of the core rules of the strategy. Most importantly, you can not automate (EA's, although I'm just learning what they are, I have no experience with them, but find them interesting) or 'blanket trade' this or any other 'set rule' (non-adaptive) method - the results in the long term will in all probability come out 50% win. So discretion and time filtering + (of course) appropriate MM may produce the much desired 65% win for 1:1 R:R. I haven't got a solid amendment to offer swilliams yet but this is what I'm using and thinking about... (I must say that all this may turn out to be non-fruitful, i.e. it may well produce 50% win in the long run after all - who knows?) 1. I note the results of the Asian session: I suspect the win% will improve if this session is not traded. It seems that when there is a win on one major its usually a win for most so the Asian session can be deceptive in this way. I also note the statistics presented by fbird (see above). However, it is a good idea to see the results of the Asian session as there may be an indicator in the PA. I've observed that a kind of a dip ('Tokyo dip') happens, i.e. PA dips into the entry (win or lose) and retraces (sometimes strongly). This seems to increase the win% if the pair triggers at the London open? 2.a. I trade at the London open (primarily): if there are too few trades I may consider the Asian session 2.b. I don't trade week 1 2.c. I don't trade Mon - core rules 3. I trade with looming Red News (usually the case): actually this is apart of the swilliam core rules and its really important - the Red News must result in decisive outcome, not be inconsequential but not be insane (tough rule) 4. I use PA its key: I make sure PA is not over extended. Especially if step 3 is not met. I prefer going with a trend and having a MWRR or MWGG trade (not sure on this yet). MWGR, MW RG, etc trades may well be extended by open of the current D candle. If PA or technical analysis shows me it's a strong move I'll put in a runner (1:3 Risk:R moving SL to 1:1 once price is around 1:2). 5. My TP target: ATR can be used as an average range of the candle that (may) will trigger the trade so it makes sense to want to hit TP within 1 or 2 candles(?). So I check ATR(14) on the 15M TF. If this reads say 4 and I choose TP=20 it may take on average 5 candles to hit TP. So, I chose either the ATR value or 2 x ATR at most depending on the PA [around 7pips is a good TP for EU, AU, etc] 6. [something I would like to do in future] Auto-reset SL: I find if there is a lose from a dip then either the entry is just hit and PA strongly retraces (nothing can be done here) or it goes for around 2-4 pips ( spreads ) before retrace and hits SL. So, I would like to setup an auto thingy where the SL resets to say 3 pips before the entry if 3pips are gained. The logic being if its not a win by then and comes back it most likely will take (full) SL. 7. MM: up to individual trader here and is essential . Otherwise you can have positive pips and negative profits (the number of +pips will be next to meaningless). I'm very conservative and trust my statistics which is why I have no problem watching a trade. Sure I get worried and emotional but I keep saying to myself - I trust my statistical analysis! I would have to make 10 consecutive loses in order to freak-out and I've never done that scalping (or anywhere near it actually). Well this is what I do. I must say all this is grossly under-tested and going live with a full account would be madness. Linhpip is leading the way for us regarding data on a minor account. My disclaimer here is I cannot (at any stage) guarantee this amendment to the strategy will work for anyone but its sure working for me at the moment. Keep going, you are doing great and we'll see where it leads us! EDT: other things to note are BRN&amp;RN, I don't focus on the number of trades, rather on the win% (of course, the process takes precedent)

Ok, here we go! The quiet before the storm... watching GU (MWRR), Tokyo dip (win). UCad never came back from Tokyo ( ). EG (MWGG) a little Tokyo dip, looking steady... Weird stuff ...wasn't a good session for scalping, PA was all over the place after entry and liq very low GU -7pips : just missed TP by 1pip EG -7pips : gave 5pips ...there was too much pip-age on the table to let it come back but this was very interesting...

--- 帖子 #408 ---
The US open went really well yesterday (I didn't set any trades) much better than the London open... nothing looks good here... this is the first time I've seen this... there is almost nothing on the majors... GJ, UJ &amp; UCad maybe in the US open?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Ok, I see what is happening... the 1D candle two days ago (on the back of multiple Red News) on a number of majors were relatively large and induced immediate corrections (inside candles - Harami's effectively) and thereby changing the trade types for this system; for excample, NU is a MWRG, AU is a WMRG, EU is a MWRG, UJ is a MWGR, UChf is a WMGR, GJ is a MWGR So, PA is too far from entries... Side note: once again good trade on Aussie 200 +10pts no problem [had runner but just came back to 1:1, no problem]: amazing statistics here with 100% wins so far! I guess this is easier to trade.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
A weird week with low results... 2 win (including Aussie 200) and 2 lose and 1 error (equal to BE?)... I'll be reviewing this one

--- 帖子 #411 ---
hi guys i read whole the thread , and one question when there is a high news impact ahead , we still need to keep these trade run or just close all ?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi cavenlee92, this is a great and important question. It seems like you are on a knifes edge with regard to what type of news to trade. In fact, its apart of the strategy to trade Red News (as you read in previous posts, traders described this as a news strategy). But we know there is various levels/importance of Red News and, as it seems, various ways they impact the Market. Generally, I have observed to keep away from extreme events (NPF, etc). To tell you the truth - I have 'no idea'.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks for the reply griffinssoul ok! So the latest indicator u guys using is on first page?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Ok, traders, just found something of interest when analyzing the two losing trades from this week. I discovered an interesting, and rather general, connection between the 'historical volatility indicator (HVI)' and potentially reversing/bouncing trades from the entry (the type that trigger entry and reverse to hit SL). This, the HVI, is more transparent than just using the ATR (as I usually do, and still will but for other reasons). (I should note that these indi's simply supply estimates that would otherwise be too cumbersome to calculate and are generally not used as triggers etc.) Looking at the chart (below, EG 15M TF) it turns out that the further away the trigger candle's HVI value is from the middle HVI value (defined by High of HVI + Low of HVI, divided by 2, from previous day) of the previous day then there is greater risk of a 'bouncing' losing trade (as was the case for EG and GU this week). A quick glance back at all my losers shows that this was the case. Note that the period of the HVI is important - I have set this as the time between the Tokyo and London opens, 28 periods (15M TF)*. This needs more analysis and testing. I must say that this should not be interpreted as a 'trigger signal' but rather as a measure of risk going into a trade. For example, if the middle HVI value is 1.00000 and the candle before the potential trigger candle is 0.01000 then this would be high risk of failure. If it was 0.50000 then you may still enter the trade but with a tighter SL strategy - like setting the SL to BE if you gain ATR(14)-spread pips? *If the period is too small &lt;20 then the reliability of the indi decreases and eventually, for small enough periods, becomes somewhat meaningless.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi cavenlee92, Yes, you may download the indi from swilliam's original post. I simply do things by hand - put in horizontal lines that is, no problem, either way. If you have any problems there are many many experts here on FF that can help you.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Please note there are various definitions used for the HVI (not to be confused with things like VIX etc). So, the basic one used here is defined by the formula HVI = Standard Deviation (Close+Previous Close)/(Previous Close) over N periods

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Been a good month for me so far!! So far this month I have made a decent amount of pips, it seems avoiding the first 5 forex trading days or full working week works quite well. I didn't get to trade on the Friday last week but on the Thursday I got AJ +15pip EA + 7pip My losses for the day only totaled 14pip so I was profitable for the day. Which seems to be the case so far this month my winning trades have outnumbered my loosing trades or been more pips winning then loosing. My most profitable pairs so far have been GJ (86pip profit) and UJ (122pip profit) which would indicate that a TP and SL of 15pip seems to be perfect for these pairs. I am going to start changing the TP and SL for my least profitable pairs and see if I can find a good number for these pairs.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Reeeen4, thank you so much for the information. You are getting incredible results! I really admire the way you are thinking and applying your analysis, well done!

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Ok, this is what has been found from the trades so far based on HVI (all trades gave shown pips and came back to SL - 'Tokyo dips')... NU(MWGG ): 1st entry gave 0pips ; Probability of success was 29% : 2nd entry gave +4.4pips ; probability of success 49% AU(MWGG): 1st entry gave +12pips ; Probability of success was 51% UJ(MWRR) : 1st entry gave +7pips ; Probability of success was 31% I guess its time to create an indi on MT4 because this is too cumbersome to do by hand...

--- 帖子 #420 ---
so far for today AU +7pips EU pending UJ first trade -7pips second trade +10.5pips GU no trade GJ no trade EJ no trade AJ no trade total = 10.5pips i reopen again the UJ at the same price point but , the TP add more 50% as the first page mention anyone using the second trade method? it is correct to use second trade method ?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Well done cavenlee92! The way I do the re-entries is, if PA comes back to at least my SL then I consider this as a legible re-entry - otherwise it may dance around the entry. I do not add / change my original settings. Its up to you what you wish to do [the original post by swilliam states that this is still under testing] but please lets us know what is working for you. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Thanks griffinssoul! I have had mixed sucess so far today. EA - 15pip (I was trying out different TP &amp; SL) might have been a bad day to try since it looks like EA is possibly changing direction or in a retracement. NU -7 UJ +15 AU +7 So I'm pretty much where I started at the beggining of today. LOL oh well no loss so that's ok. The day is still young though and the others look pretty hopeful!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I believe this is also because of the deception of the Tokyo session. When you win big its because almost everything wins, so it makes it look better than just winning 60-70%. [I could have told you NU was looking bad and AU good from the probabilities. But this needs more work.] What are your stats telling you about the Asian session?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
EU &amp; UChf both looking good, very slow but steady. I had 31% prob on both before trigger [which means I would have a tighter SL strategy in place? AU with higher prob (51%) would have been good for a runner (+26pips)]. I'm tied of calculating the math by hand EG coming up but I'm taking a pass ; over-extended and low prob (34%)... actually its looking good around 5pips... got to around 7pips.. ok, can we put that down to the (non-Red) news?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
this is the total today result , not bad for the first trying this system, looking forward for tomorrow anyone is suggest to put the pending the order again when it hit SL or just let it be ??

--- 帖子 #426 ---
MM is up to you cavenlee92. EDT: I am very conservative, no martingale type systems, no chasing trades etc (IMO accounts are quickly lost this way)...

--- 帖子 #427 ---
London open was looking terrible (typically, PA was hovering around entries unconvincingly) and there was absolutely nothing happening at the US open - weird stuff. Ok, once again we get this weird phenomena were we have Harami type patterns. NU(shooting star), AU(doji), UJ(dragon fly) have all changed to MWRG or MWGR types (from MWRR or MWGG). All far from entries. GJ &amp; EJ (MWRR's) are online and looking good... (all other majors that I can see are No Trade) EDT: following reeeen4 I tried 15pips for both GJ &amp; EJ : GJ -15pips and EJ +15pips = nothing!

--- 帖子 #428 ---
The well is dry... (there use to be so many trades!) GU &amp; EJ looks like they would have worked... GJ &amp; AU online and looking ok NU needs to run up hard to make it to the entry...

--- 帖子 #429 ---
hi guys today result and friday can be trade as usual ?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
great job guys. development looks good

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Wonderful results cavenlee92. Keep going! Yes, all trading days except first week of 1M and each Mon. Since there are so few trades I would suggest trading everything I could at this stage and follow reeeen4.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
ok! so you mean you suggust trading every pair ?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
With everyone's help and contributions this has developed into a great little strategy - its quiet fundamental and self-governing in a lot of ways.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
AU (MWRG) &amp; GU (MWRR) online and looking ok... all other major that I see are No Trade

--- 帖子 #435 ---
today i only have my GU is pending sell stop other i see no trade pending is AU have a pending order ?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
AU is a MWRG trade which implies it is far from entry... it may trigger later in the LO? EDT: actually all the opens look very close... (see chart, 1D TF)

--- 帖子 #437 ---
All the majors as they have minimal spreads ... but there is not much on offer at the moment...

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi Traders, just a quick update... recently got MT4 and started investigating Custom indi's, Scripts, EA's etc. I have now developed a simple indi that I will be using to quickly assess a trade. A big thanks to Mr Bilal Haider ( https://www.youtube.com/user/MQLprogrammingtuts/ ) for making available his wonderful lessons on MQL4 programming and the MQL4 forum. I also hope to make a script (I think or EA?) to quickly drop in an order should the indi give a positive signal and all looks good. This would save a lot of time, time you can free up for analysis etc. [I also wanted the indi to tell me if this was the 2nd, 3rd etc trade. Also, a moving probability of success from previous trades etc. The pips from the trigger value relative to the ATR value etc.]. Some other things come to mind like having an array of different SL strategies etc. Cool! Side note; happy to upload this for further development and testing but I'm not sure if that is permitted? See chart example ...

--- 帖子 #439 ---
great contribution. you can share here so many will test it zalbu

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thanks zalbu. I'm wanting permission from Swilliam's [thread leader] before uploading as there is already an indi on page [1]. However, the indi on page [1] is commercial (I believe), cannot be altered and does not fully meet our needs. So there may be good motivation for developing our own. If I receive permission perhaps it can be uploaded to page[1] - I'm not sure about the protocol here.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Ok traders, here we go... EU, EJ, UJ, GJ, AJ, UChf, NU, UCad (32pip gap), AN(9pip) are all Trade status... (using my indi). Currently working on a Script to quickly drop in orders. This would make the whole process very efficient. Side note: recall discussion about the number of pips between the MNO &amp; WO. The idea was the closer they are the more this implies consolidation. All this means it that you may not get a Trade status (and if you do it may not trigger) but eventually you would expect a break-out of some kind.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Ok, got the Aussie 200 +10pts (again! still 100% here, although I was worried this time cause it went into after-hours) ... Others that would have worked... NU, AN

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Well, I started trading this system again after a bit of a break. Should've made 10 pips on EU, but order was cancelled (error BV:SL) which I think means that my SL of 10 pips fell within the spread. Thanks Oanda does anyone else use them and run into this? ... Can anyone recommend a good broker?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
UChf &amp; EU both +7pips : wasn't watching but i liked the PA UJ never triggered. Great to see lots of trades back on as it makes it easy to trade

--- 帖子 #445 ---
nice griffinssoul this is today result , just UC TP , but i don know why my EU had been cancel out , it havent reach the SL point AU hit SL and using the second method to re-entry again still SL , will try again tomorrow for not using re-entry method

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi Nico1359! Yep, as you guys (mwsteiner, fbird, swilliams etc) discussed previously in this thread... variable spread, slippage etc are all enemies of this method (as with most scalping). Welcome back!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Good Job! But was AU a trade? My indi says No Trade? "... i don know why my EU had been cancel out".. variable spread... increases with volatility/liquidity etc (degree is broker dependent). Its hard to factor that into TP/SL. EDT: there is the option of fixed and variable spread brokers. Look this up here @ FF for further info.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Oops forgot that topic already came up... It's been a while!

--- 帖子 #449 ---
No worries Nico, you guys covered a lot of ground and it took quiet a while to absorb all the info.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
EU, EG, NU, GU, EA, AZ, GChf, AChf, AU, UJ, UChf, are all Trade status... cross check please UCad - could drop its guts as we speak...

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Ok, this is how I played UCad ... 3 x risk 50% : 1 x 4.2pips + 1 x 5pips + 1 x BE(+a bit more : 4pips) SL [still going] EDT: Out on SL 4pips... So, about 9pips on standard risk [great for UCad] + runner (2) got 4pips = +13pips UCad : very slow... ...but got there in the end. PA was solid all the way which is why I risked a bit more... had a staggered TP 4,5,6 strategy, anticipating low volatility

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hey Guys, Going on holidays for a week so won't be trading this week or next week which is the first week of the new month anyway so wouldn't be trading regardless. Green pips to all while I'm gone!

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Have a wonderful and safe holiday reeeen4! I think by the time you come back things will be picking up anyway - we've gone through a very dry consolidation period. So far, I'm 100% win this week!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hello Thank you for this thread, interesting strategy. Wonder if there would be a highest win rate with this system, using a 3 pips TP and 7 pip's SL, on very low spread pairs.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Ok, seems like a lot on offer but nothing that springs out to me, yet? UCad, EG, NU, GU, AN, EA, GA, AChf, GChf,... are all Trade status... please cross check. I'll have a closer look at NU @ the USO? Everything's far from trigger anyway...

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi Brandon66, good question! This has been discussed previously in this and other threads on the topic, (scalping and R:R). I think generally, for any scalping method the win % improves but it is at the cost of R:R being against the trader. I, like swilliams and others here, do not trade under conditions of Risk:R greater than 2:1. In fact I try and trade as close to 1:1 as possible. There is good reason (please read thread posts here to find out why) for this ratio. May I suggest that you investigate MM (many resources here on FF) as every trader must decide what is best for themselves. I hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
EA +7pips : no problem, helped along by mild news (who knows)? AChf was the inverse correlated pair and was a quick win for 7 but I missed that one in all the excitement. Still scoping NU, Call Contact eta USO...

--- 帖子 #458 ---
UCad, EG, GU, AN, EA, GA, AChf, AU, UChf, EChf, AJ, AU &amp; EU all on Trade status... please cross check... Looks like NU triggered at some time ... totally missed this but it only gave 2.5pips anyway ... looks like aussie 200 would have worked + a number of pairs but I missed them all... What a great week! 5/5 so far! Things are picking up...

--- 帖子 #459 ---
AChf -7pips (2nd entry worked but I didn't take it) I knew the PA was good here but it bounced off the trigger 3 or so times then 2nd entry shot through but had no time to setup &amp; UChf +10pips : quickly done Looking at EU on the 1H TF ... this would be 2nd entry, gave 6pips in the first (I didn't take it)... I really like PA here : used MNO as S&amp;R - change of polarity on 4H TF and its south all the way... placed a runner and waiting

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Finally got triggered on EU +7pips : I really liked the PA but dropped the runner (too much unnecessary risk for the end of the trading week... the runner would have worked but you can't be too greedy) So, that makes it 7 wins for 1 loss this week : 53pips all up ... have a great weekend (I'll be hard at work on additions and improvements to my indi) EDT: Oops, please excuse me I had GU setup (totally forgot) until an alarm went off and I had a heart-attack ! GU +7pips What can I say?

great result. happy weekend to all

Hi Swilliam, I've been working on a 'new' indi for this thread. Just fixed some bugs with XAUUSD and indicies. It shows trade status, type, difference b/w opens (in pips), and spread. I'm adding a few more things hopefully... what do you think?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
...just added a Trigger value [Trig] which is, by the rules, 1 pipette above/below previous days high/low... and an ATR% which tells you what percentage the current value of (MN_High - MN_Low) is with respect to the ATR(14) on the MN1 TF. This gives you an indication of how much the current MN has 'room to move' relative to the average. However, there will also be extremes; for example a small doji or spinning top would show a small ATR% where as a large engulfing candle (pattern) would result in a large ATR%. Remember, the definition of the ATR does not only depend on (MN_High - MN_Low).

--- 帖子 #464 ---
hi griff, can you share the indicator and how to use

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hi mikajap, just waiting for the ok from swilliam. Its a simple indi but seems to be working ok and is informative more so than anything else. Basically, it shows the current MN and W opens (just two horz lines). This updates every MN/W so there is effectively no history. The reason I did this was too simplify the display as I don't really need previous opens(?) [see examples in the above post]. Then there is a corner information panel. If the trade is valid it will say ' Trade ' otherwise it says ' No Trade '. So just by glancing you know which pairs are trades (sometimes its hard to tell). Then it tells you what kind of a trade it is e.g. MWRR, etc. This is just something I'm keeping track of and it may be important. Next is how far apart the opens are in pips - in the first week they are 0pips! ... lol. You may decide that 10pips is a minimum before trading? The next is the spread in pipettes (for 0.00010). Finally there is the ATR% as explained above.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi griff, you can share it. also to keep interaction around here. Ideas are open here. Please identify your trade rules so others can fully understand Happy weekend to all.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Traders, please find attached the indi I have developed and am using for this strategy. Please feel free to modify it as required, in anyway - help everyone by further development if you can, thank you. This is my first MT4 indi as I have only recently downloaded the program. Common sense then implies that everyone using this indi should excersize cation and, again, I recommend that we only conduct [demo] account testing here. (One thing I'm trying to understand is there seems to have been a (major?) change in the programming language so I'm not sure if I've written this in the modern version - there is no buffers?) Instructions: please place in MQL4/indicators folder as per usual. Select the indi within MT4 and then toggle through MN, W to D TF's. Oh, and just save a 'template' as this makes things easier.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
You may like to know that there are a full array of execution scripts @ http://www.mql5.com/en/code/11087 and the author encourages modification. This seems easy to mod to suit this strategy - it gets a bit repetitive setting orders. I'm running two (Buy/Sell) scripts for 7pips/7pips (EU, AU, etc...) and 15pips/15pips (UJ, etc...). This looks great! Remember reeeen4 said 15pips was the most win% for UJ, etc. There is also a mod SL script - you can set it to BE+some...

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Ok, traders - here we go... currently have the following set-ups leading into the first trading D (Tue) of the new W of the new MN; EU, GU, UChf, AChf, EA, GA, AU, UJ, NU, UCad Notice that all these are either XX GR or XX RG combo's - there is no XX RR nor XX GG . This is what typically happens early on the trading MN timetable... when things get going trend-wise we will have RR's and GG's ...

--- 帖子 #470 ---
... watching EU. Ok, we had a bounce off the trigger then (so far) a 38.2 retrace (15M TF). Looking good for LO... roughly a descending triangle... coming in for landing... No (Red) News(?), US bank holiday.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
EU +7pips : also added runner (+10pips) due to strong PA : see chart (15M TF)

--- 帖子 #472 ---
...watching some of the XJ's : EJ, GJ, AJ (are all 2nd entries) &amp; UJ, all MWGG's ...Dialing down to 1H TF, seeing engulfing pattern on all (yet to be confirmed). Only one thing worries me, all are way overbought [confirm with any osc]. Engulfing pattern (on all) not confirmed we're going for a 38.2 retrace... eta trigger LO or bust... Hang-on, wait!, make that NYO or bust... lol!

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Ok, I got AJ triggered with +15pips (didn't see it) but none of the others triggered... I missed a lot today... nothing currently looking good...

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Ok... Mmmm everything looking a bit exhausted... PA may well put its feet up and have a nice cup of Tea perhaps... lol Watching EG (2nd entry) may have a surprise at the LO or USO (also watching GChf)? UCad could do the same? UCad just 38.2 retraced into the trigger (15M TF), its a bit early but we'll see what happens... ooops, got in too early by the look of it - it retraced 61.2... I'm out with -7pips Also, EG &amp; GChf -7pips each... Ouch!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I created an EA for this strategy. It works on daily charts (D1 time frame). To backtest it, you need to use the real ticks.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi MathTrader7, this is great! I notice that its a .ex4 file ... is there any chance of uploading the .mq4 version. If not could you please let us know how it works? (I haven't used a EA before.) Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Ok, start-up the EA, ...lol... I'm looking at AN &amp; UJ.... AN +7pips : took 1 second... not taking UJ looks tied, perhaps needs a nap... lol

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Ok, watching EG (&amp;GChf).... a light retrace on the 1H TF... would have been nicer to see a 38.2 as it looks like a dumpling top... (Mmmm dumplings...lol) EG +7pips and, its cousin, GChf +7pips : just took one 15M candle but got there quiet strongly... absolutely perfect timing for this one...

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Been a really bad past few days for me with this strategy... my demo is lower then its ever been!!! not sure what's going on... going to have to sit down and study the charts.

Hi reeeen4, hope you had a relaxing &amp; fun holiday! Ok, I think I have a handle on this now... see the chart on post 471 (like above, on this page)... well thats the general idea... if PA retraces too much then chances are it will bounce but if it retraces like around 38.2 then it has a better chance of TP... keep going!!! Oh, and the timing is important... the LO seems to be the most reliable... but it also swaps around to make things confusing with Tokyo &amp; US... Don't forget the market is changing all the time so PA wins in the end over anything else... EDT: but thats just me reeeen4, you should keep doing what you were doing cause it was working...

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Mmmm... AN retraced a bit too much (50 1H TF) but I'm watching it... it bounced up (luckily no trigger)...61.8 15M TF... AN +7pips : a bit of luck was needed... took 2 15M candles could have easily been SL if the bounce triggered entry (just missed)

--- 帖子 #482 ---
... Ok, watching UJ, EJ, GJ : notice that the ATR% is 177 UJ &amp; 166 EJ - the XJ's have been drinking moon-shine... lol. But GJ's ATR% is only 97... Mmmm... looking @ 1H TF, all have a possible 38.2 retrace in to the trigger... may take some time perhaps (small candle bodies)...

--- 帖子 #483 ---
...I think thats it for this week... 100% win - 4 wins (3 excellent and 1 lucky... hey a win is a win )... the third week of the month seems to be the best...? Hope everyone had a green week

--- 帖子 #484 ---
yes, a nice week, the news gave some juice to the moves lets see what happens the next days

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I think the XJ's look way over extended and exhausted, so this doesnt help us when looking for quick impulse moves helped by the news... What I'm really looking forward to is seeing what happens over the next two months...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
...just a quick reminder that we generally dont trade Mon's : if you look at your indicator you will see most trades are either No Trade or they are type XXGR or XXRG and have a long way to go for the trigger...

--- 帖子 #487 ---
I'm trying MathTrader7's EA - so far no trading not at all ... hmmm what's wrong here on my side ? EDIT: Have to correct myself ! It works - a GBPJPY buy is open now !

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi DerBerliner, please let us know how this goes... I havent been using this... thanks!

--- 帖子 #489 ---
...can't see anything close... there was a few pairs that looked good in the Asian session e.g. EA...???

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Here you go: https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/o...-gp-37/1084708 As you may see in the history the bot took 2 AUDUSD shorts (1 winner, 1 looser), the 3 buy trades with JPY pairs hit the SL. (Broker is GP = Global Prime)

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Many thanks for that - oh, yes, the JPY pairs are very overbought/extended so not very good perhaps for this method. Reeeen4 also commented on this ... it will be interesting to see how the EA fairs over the coming months...Thanks!

--- 帖子 #492 ---
...watching AN, GChf, AU,... AN +7pips : no problem, watching the 1H candle, there was a BRN that I was worried about but no problems...shallow retrace less than 38.2 AU +7pips : did not see it, retraced up to the 50 then straight down to TP on one 1H candle GChf +7pips : same story as AU above...

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I dont have AN + GChf in the bot's acc, but AU hit the SL 10 pips (that was a close thing !) bevor the price went in the "right" direction" and could reach the TP. I have for AU in the params TP = 10 pips (post #1).

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi DerBerliner, this is very interesting... I had to dial down to 5M TF to see the trigger candle... there was the first 5M candle that hit the low 0.85125 but I was triggered @ 13 seconds of the next 5M candle, so for some reason it did not trigger the first time? - Not sure why not (Oh, maybe spread? But this makes no sense? Maybe Tolerance?)? Thank you so much for this information. I did not see this...? If it was triggered by the first 5M candle then yes I would have my SL hit? EDT1: wait, I can see this better on the 1M candles, there seems to be no problem? It simply missed the SL? Other traders have reported this; its a mixed bag of results associated with brokers, spreads , slippage etc etc. There was one case were the PA was about to hit TP then the traders were stopped out due to increase in spread! This is very frustrating indeed! EDT2: I also checked the other two trades using the 1M (this leaves no mistakes) but they were far from the SL's (I was watching AN anyway...)

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi ! 1. The bot is trading right - accordingly to the rules. 2. So far it got mostly loosers. Its a pity, but the last trades didn't have enough momentum to run into the TP or they went first in the SL and running after hiting again in the right direction .... to late already for having success. @MathTrader7: may be you could add into the code TSL, BE, JSL ? These thingies could help perhaps preventing these fucking situations ?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Here is a new version which implements Move to BE and Trailing Stop features. Note1: The minimum stop loss distance (MSLD) for a currency pair is defined by the broker. So, the stop loss cannot be moved less than MSLD to the current price. Keep in mind this when you set the input parameters for Move SL to BE and TSL. Note2: I have created this EA to test this strategy. So, use it on your own risk. I do not know if the strategy is profitable or not.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Thx MT7 ! That was quick ! Will change now the bot on the test platform ! Lets see how the strategy will work ....

--- 帖子 #498 ---
UCad +7pips : no problem, very strong &amp; quick move : retraced b/w 23-32.8... That makes 4 wins, 100% again... very good results for the week... That makes it 10 wins &amp; 3 loses for the month = 56pips ... some of those were close to SL, say 3, so if they were stopped out then it would be more closer to 50/50 win/lose... so luck could have something to do with it...

--- 帖子 #499 ---
@MathTrader7 The bot could prevent today loosers. I plan a further testing. 2 requests for coding: Could you plz add the trading hour function to choose (limit) a specific trading time ? AND: Could you include into the bot a fixed algorithm to open trades only from tuesday to friday, i. e. exclude monday.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
+7 pip

--- 帖子 #501 ---
hmm ...

--- 帖子 #502 ---
hmmm!

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Here is a new version of the EA which implements options for time of trading and Mondays trading.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Thank you so much MathTrader7!!! I do not use this but it is great support for traders that do

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi MathTrader7, If it is at all possible, could you please run a backtest (on EU&amp;UJ perhaps?) over at least 3 months of data (even just based on 1M) comparing the EA without time filter to the EA with time filter. Also, (with the timefilter) testing each major opening (Asian(Tokyo), London &amp; US). This maybe asking too much, no problem, but it would be most informative. Thanks!!! Currently, all the backtested results have been done manually. Although a first step, they are rather crude and limited to say the least. Although backtesting will not fully show the methods performance it will be of some use.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
@MT7 Thx a lot ! That was quick again ! Great, appreciate your very reliable support ! @griffinssoul - Hmm ... BUT using the crapMT4 for backtests wont give much better results. The only better attampt would be the application of tick data. That approach is a bit better, although the only proof could be forward trading on a live acc ! Even demos with scalpers dont give convincing results.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
@MT7 - is the time parameter in the code broker time ? Or is it my computer time ? And yes: to make it sure+easier for setting right time numbers in "F7" - could you plz let the bot show on the chart a simple comment like "trading on"/"trading off" ? But better not in the right or left upper corner bcz of other comments there are shown already.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hi MT7 ! I thought a bit about this strategy ... and I have to add two things/requests. As per rules the possibility for choosing of the trade numbers is allowed - a second attempt is allowed. So could you add in F7 the option for choosing the max. number of trades during one day. More important is this: The strategy is a break out over or under the daily maximums of the previous day. So using another time then the daily open it is necessary that the price must be at the time of starting the trading (eg London session) under that high - for a buy. If the price broke already the high during the asian session and is at the start of LO open over the high - no trade ! I hope I could explain it right ?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Excellent work DerBerliner! The ball is in your court, as they say, and I will be very interested to see the outcome

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Ok ... I took the ball .... The only thing is: we have to wait the referee = MathTrader7 ! Without him we cant play the next round "V4" of the match !

--- 帖子 #511 ---
LOL! ...I just remembered, there were some traders who did take this method 'live'. I think it was Linhpip (or similar? Please excuse me if this is incorrect) and someone else (sorry forgot... )... so, this may be of some use to you... Their live results were around 50/50 win/lose... (if you care to scroll through the posts you will find the graph of the results)...

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I'm modifying the EA to work on M1 charts such that we do not need real ticks to back test it. In the new version (that I'm currently working on) there would be virtual stop loss and take profit levels, and the EA controls open/close positions at the beginning of each M1 bar. This enable us to 1) obtain more reliable results, and 2) optimize the EA with different input settings much faster (in reasonable time). I would apply other changes (such as the max. number of trades per day, etc.) after this release.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Thx MT7 ! Reliably as always ! So waiting for opening the next round of the match ! Our referee already entered the playing field !!!

--- 帖子 #514 ---
That sounds amazing MathTrader7 ! This would be of great value IMO... I agree with DerBerliner that it may not be a good as (forward) live trading/testing (live traders have reported problems with slippage etc) but surely it would give us further (valuable) information

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Here is a new version of the EA that runs on M1 charts. This EA has been specifically written for backtesting. Use "Open prices only" model (not every ticks) for backtesting. Here is the best performance I could come up with optimization:

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Great man !! Really great !! So my question is: can I use for the regular trading ? Is it possible to not only for BT's ? And what about the tine parameter ? What time is it we have to put in ? Ah ... and yes what's the setfile you used for the BT above ?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
This version of the EA does not set broker side SL and TP levels, but virtual levels (which are controlled by the EA). So it is not recommended for live trading (unless for demo purposes). The input settings are what I used for the backtest. The trading start time is 17:00 (GMT+2), which filters out many trades. As you can see from the backtest results, we only have 93 trades over the period 2013.01.03 to 2014.11.01. Later, I will submit a version which works with each and every tick instead of open prices only, and you can use it for live trading, if you want.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Great work MathTrader7 ! This is very valuable data that this method has been missing. I'm trying to come to terms with the results - they look promising at first but the win/loss % are very close to 50/50 suggesting a variable risk assignment per trade??? Perhaps I am incorrect in my interpretation? EDT: no problem I just saw your post above....

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Ok, so I'll wait for the V5 ! I like to start the bots immediatly in forward tests.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Here is V5 which is the same as V4 but works with ticks...

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Surprise ! Wow ! I hardly could write my wish and my dream cames true only in a moment later !

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Dear all ! I tried the V5 this week - no good news ... and that is on a demo. I got mostly loosers. It seems this strategy is highly discretionary. Maybe sitting and watching only some pairs, closing the trades at the right time could make you a winner ? But automatic trading didn't work for me. It seems especially in the asian session there isn't enough momentum for succesful BO's over resp. under the extrema of the previous days ? The bot worked a bit better in LO/NY sessions ... but in summary it produced more loosers too. And I think, even if possible: the automatisation of this strategy is hard to achieve. I'm out so far. Thx MathTrader7 !!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi DerBerliner, I am puzzled by your comment??? This W1? The W1 starting 1st Dec was a No Trade week??? For the simple reason that the two opens are the same... Actually. there is no rule against it but there has been discussion suggesting its a bad idea...? Perhaps your results re-confirm this... Please keep going!!! Also we are coming into holidays so Jan &amp; Feb would be more interesting perhaps...

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I must be candid: I'm a bloody nanual trader. And scalping is much more harder manual trading then all other manual strategies. I'm testing a lot of other EA's - so I'm atm not very active here ... watching perhaps new ideas. Maybe someone else has an idea for a better setfile then mine ?

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Ok, here we go with a new trading W1: ... nothing much looks good @ the moment (may be things will improve @ the USO)... currently watching the EU/UChf pair of pairs(?)...

--- 帖子 #526 ---
There is no doubt that MathTrader7 is the one to talk with about EA's and different scalping strategies... With this method could you perhaps select the pairs that look good on the trading day and simply drop them into the EA? I find it easy to scan all pairs with reasonable spreads and then to drop in an order if they look good?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
EU +7pips / UChf +7pips : both strong moves with EU lagging... great start to the trading week...

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Observing the results of backtesting with V4 (and what I've seen in forward test so far), I'm convinced that one would expect to obtain breakeven following the rules mechanically (as EA does). However, the strategy might be profitable with some additional rules. One thing in my mind is to look at 5-minute bars and enter a trade if the M5 bar breakouts the level, or completely closes on the other side of the level. @ griffinssoul : What do you think about this idea?

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I totally agree with your findings re "...expect to obtain breakeven". I also agree that what is needed is a PA based additional rule - for example I use a simple retrace rule which seems to work well (see post 471) but I also like your 5M candle idea... Note: I also use all the time filters: No trade - W1 &amp; Mon in addition to the LO

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Ok ... so any V6 will be posted here ? I'm ready for a new test !

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I will work on V6, but first I need to study the pull back idea to see if it is possible to program it into the EA. If not, I will go for my own idea. Stay tuned! :-)

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hi. Can you give a source code ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #533 ---
It seems that we need to enter by that system when D1 bar is closed. But it's 4.00 am !!! It's too early for me every time to wake up so. I would like to make or to test any automation on it

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I tested the EA with my both idea: M5 bar must breaks out the level, and M5 bar must close completely on the other side of the level. Unfortunately, they do not help much... But I think the idea of retracement, as you mentioned in post 471, would give us better entry points. If I can implement the retracement idea into the EA (which is kind of subjective to the human being judgement), I will submit the new version here...

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Ok great ! Waiting patiently !

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I must say MathTrader7 that I'm amazed by your work rate! Thank you so much!!! Yes, I think you are correct, without 'human judgement' the system would BE in the long run, I'd say. Sometimes there is obvious bad trades that a human would avoid but a computer/EA would take. Other times, as was the case yesterday, nothing looks good and a human would simply not trade. If fact, I would be suprized to see any EA work fully without a human and be profitable year-on-year? Have you seen anything close? The main advantage of a EA, as I see it, would be to automate all the repetitive stuff which makes life hard.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
great work guys, specially for mathtrader7 for the EA. I still prefer manual. but EA is good in back testing. Anyone did a backrest? are Weekly and monthly open lines accurate in BT?

--- 帖子 #538 ---

@ Mathtrader : Any update on version 6 of the EA

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Unfortunately, it is not trivial to program a trading method which is subjective to the human being feelings/judgements... However, I'm working on a Fuzzy Logic implementation that may be able to mimic the retracement judgement in this strategy...

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Very impressive MT7 ... yeah, logic was always a bit fuzzy to me aswell (LOL!) - what is fuzzy logic?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
With Fuzzy Logic we can assign a real number between 0 and 1 to the truth of a statement. This gives us a powerful tool in programming statements such as "if the CCI value is high and the RSI value is moderate and the distance of close price to MA is low , then open a short position". From programming point of view, words such as high , moderate and low have no meaning, unless we define thresholds to compare the values. But thresholds are not able to capture human being judgements. For example, what if the value of the CCI is just 0.000001 lower than the threshold? Is that mean that the conditions are not met yet? Well, from logic point of view, they still not met, although a human would take an action in this situation. We, as human being, do not act mechanically for our judgements. Our logic is fuzzy, if we feel that some value is high enough, then we consider it high. Fuzzy Logic theory has been developed to try to mimic this behavior of the human being. You can find out more about Fuzzy Logic here .

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Wow that is really interesting MT7 - so if computers work from 0 &amp; 1s can you make a fuzzy logic computer (not just a program?). Thanks for the link i will read about this cause it sounds amazing. So the idea is to try and build an EA to mimic a human trader but still have the no emotional responses of a machine (i think i saw a movie about this... LOL!). Many thanks MT7!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
In order to create a computer to use just one more level than two levels (0 and 1), there is an essential problem that is not trivial to be solved by electic signals we use, for example, L voltage to indicate digit 0 , and H voltage (H&gt;L) to indicate digit 1 . If we want to use any other voltage level (between L and H, lower than L or higher than H, it doesn't matter) to indicate another digit, the voltage signal has to pass one level to reach another which makes confusion. For example, if we choose 0 volt for digit 0, +2.5 volt for digit 1 and +5 volt for digit 2, in order to have a three digits representaiton instead of binary representation, then when the voltage level is in 0 volt and it wants to take the value 2 (+5 volts), it has to pass the voltage 2.5 volts, which means our computer receives the digit 1 before it receives digit 2 for some computation....

--- 帖子 #552 ---
I see, that sounds understandable [you can only have an on &amp; off switch... lol... no dimmer] but way over my head with all the technicals - thank you so much for sharing, you really know a lot about this so i hope you can come up with an EA

--- 帖子 #553 ---
hi swilliam and friends, hows everybody here? still trading this system for scalps. What is the latest devt?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hi mikajap, as you know with this system there are long periods of no trading and if you then impose further restriction, like trading LO etc, this results in even less trades so i just have this as an extra method. So, if MT7 produces the EA you can just switch it on when required.

--- 帖子 #555 ---

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hey Griffinsoul, I've got your open scalping strategy.mq4 onboard. I've been right back in this thread until you joined it without being able to find what I'm looking for (unless I missed it somehow) But that is the meaning of the letters DNA, MWGG, WMGG, etc etc. Currently I'm watching USDCAD 4hr with a trade signal on the indicator and the letters MWGG. I haven't taken it as it was above the trigger price when I noticed it. It would have been a good trade long but,,,,I missed it. Actually I'm also watching what appears to be good divergence which means she's about ready to short but that's another method.
