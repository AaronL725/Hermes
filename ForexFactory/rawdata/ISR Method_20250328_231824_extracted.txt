I S R METHOD Welcome My Name is Informed and I have been trading the financial markets for a few years, and through my years of trading I have notice certain things about the market that I have been blind to before. The MARKETS are not free markets determined by random price movement but markets that move influenced by those able to see both sides of the markets(market makers), these price movement can be understood and modelled to take advantage of price for a profit. The ISR Method is not created but discovered as this kind of price structure reveals itself continuously in the Forex, Stock and other markets. I will be continuously improving the first post with information concerning the method and as we make progress. ISR stands for I - Induce S - Stop Hunt R - Run for profit These are the three elements that you will find in price. Some times it's clear and sometimes it's not. Stocks are my favourite when it come to this then follows currency since they do move in a similar but not exact way. 1. Bullish and Bearish Sentiment Before we are able to start talking about trade setups we need to first talk of bullish and bearish sentiment. We may all have different views and theories of how the market moves up and down but what we all have in common is that we search for repetitive things in it in order to make a profit. In stocks for the ISR Method we will use the weekly time frame but for forex and metals like silver we will be using the 4hr time frame. These time fames were not chosen at random as over time they have proven to work well in sentiment direction which is an advantage for the trade set up. The charts are to be kept as clean as possible from any other indicators except for the 3 ema wave(Thank you Raghee Horner) which have the settings of... 60 ema High - Gree n 60 ema Close - Blue 60 ema Low - Red Stock Bull and Forex Bull Whenever the Weekly candle for stock closes above the ema wave then we are in a bullish sentiment. Whenever the 4Hr candle closes for fore closes above the ema wave then we are in a bullish sentiment. Stock and Forex Bear Whenever the Weekly candle for stock closes below the ema wave then we are in a bearish sentiment. Whenever the 4H candle closes below the ema wave then we are in a bearish sentiment. Stock and Forex Sentiment Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Without this sentiment we wont be able to better direct our trade set ups and might be entering into trade contrary to the trend as we seek products(Stock or currency pairs) that show a consistency in trend movement. 2 . I S R Structure For The Trade Setup we will be using a one hour chart for forex and a Daily time frame for Stock I will be discussing the setup structure then later ill talk of it in details. Sentiment is the key to be able to trade this setup effectively (A) Induce The first thing that the market makers will do is that they will induce you to go in the right direction at the wrong time. They do this by provoking you to see that the market is going up or down at that time with moves that seem what positive in that direction (B) Stop Hunt The stop hunt is followed after the induction to take out stop losses along with inducing you to go in the wrong direction. The Induction with the stop hunt is a classical ISR method price action structure. (C) Run for Profit After the stop hunt the market makers then begin to move the price in the intend direction to make a profit. this is seen by a push up or down in a zig zag manner. This is to serve to build up an understand of the price structure of a trade, and I will be going into detail concerning this as we progress father. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) For stocks we look for these structure on a daily time frame and then for forex and other markets(will give details later) we look for the set up on the H1 If you try go down to the 15min you will find setups along with the perfect opportunity of frustration and getting burned. 3. The Anatomy of a Trade Setup I am in conflict between first releasing the ISR threading skill post or the entry setup post , nevertheless I will first speak of the I S R trade setup then at a later stage introduce the ISR threading skill . a) We have previously established that we do not trade except for the trade being in the direction of the sentiment . There will always be setups that appear in the direction that the sentiment doesn't point, but to be a successful trend trader means that we do not trade all trends especially those that do not fall inline with our sentiment. b) After the Stop hunt we wait for price candle to pop up(if buying) or pop down(if selling) and close. We then wait for price to have a pull back candle or a doji that closes( some form of resistance) then finally anticipate a candle that will break the previous resistant candle'- Important! c) The Stop loss will be place just below the ema wave as seen on the image with a risk to reward ratio of 1:2( will explain at a later stage the reason) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Details Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) 4. Pair Selection The following pairs are not the complete list but a few Fore pairs that you may begin practicing the method on without much head ackees EURJPY GBPNZD GBPUSD AUDUSD EURUSD(This one may have some attitude) OIL I will be editing this information as i seek to make it more simpler and more clear over time. 5. The Anatomy of a SHL(IMPORTANT) https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14474474 6. The Origin - The sweet spot of ISR https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14499784 Rules This will be a part of house keeping to protect the beautiful thing that we have here . 1. NO INDICATOR IS ALLOWS EXCEPT FOR THE 3 EMA WAVE 2. When posting a trade please post two charts a) 4H Sentiment chart b) 1H setup chart The M15 Breeze Setup - FOREX https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14457465 - CRYPTOCURRENCY https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...8#post14474248 In the posts to follow I will do my best to do justice to the trade method and reveal to you the keys for a successful trade setup. I will later be putting up rules for posting trade setups and behaviour in this thread so we may all be able to get along.

Hi Informed, thank you for this interesting and professional thread. You should clearly explain the entry ( buy &amp; sell) on H1 tf. The last screenshot on post #1 that you posted is not very clear. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Everything is clearly and clearly revealed the topic. Thank you Informed for your contribution and detailed description.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I will do my best to make it more clear...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
@informed Not very clear the sentiment rule. How many candles you need to be closed above/below indicator bands?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
one candle close... I might have to do a video or a few for the little details... But I will be adding these point on to the 1st post as I'm asked Questions. Thank you

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Is it really a bullish sentiment if for forex just 1 candle H4 is closing above the MAs?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Price closes below so should be bearish. What happened next? Immediately after a complete reversal but sentiment was supposed to be bearish.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Wrong. You are looking at H1 chart, H4 candle did not close below the EMAs.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thank you for clarifying that.

I'm sorry, but I have a question. Can there be a HUNTING STOP LEVEL greater than 1 ? Or does my installation not match?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Your mixing up the time frames IL do an edit on the first post to touch on this.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks for editing, the first post with a detailed explanation, now it remains to follow how it works in real time...or time will tell, thanks for posting.. keep going

--- 帖子 #41 ---
What do you mean for "for fore closes"?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Typing error.. I will correct that

--- 帖子 #43 ---
There will be calibrations that will be added on at a later stage(especially with forex) but we will get there when we are finished with certain concepts in the method

Hi Informed I do not have very clear is your rules for ISR steps For long position Induce - Do you mean a breakout above the H4 candle that indicates bullish direction? Stop hunt level - Do you mean the lowest swing point created after the inducement ? Entry *Is your entry taken after price croosed the stop hunt level and closed avobe? Run for profit - I let the choice open to each taste Thank you for you answer Gerald

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Good thread, I use EMA 240 and only close/high to determine levels (or EMA 240 HA on MT4). But same trading. Note that EMA 240 4 H = EMA 60 12H if you play with the TFs and EMAs you can build the structure of the markets Attached Image (click to enlarge) green pips

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Just tuned in, Informed. Been doing this a long time. Am impressed with what you have expressed in ISR. Better than what I do after all these years. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I think you have levels on a completely different system, the graph is very compressed (it's hard to see)

Greetings Thank you so much for your interest in The ISR method. What you are saying might seem like an advantage but there will be Gaps in your sentiment within the scope of the ISR method. I've been here before but it disadvantaged me in the method. Much appreciated

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Your on the right path

--- 帖子 #61 ---
you have sharp eyes. Now just remove the other ema and use only the 3 ema(60) I've posted pairs you can trade this with comfort.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
This is not the ISR method

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi Informed Can you show a more detailed example about the setup and entry Thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I know the frustration you have with this pair... Try the ones I just posted.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Alright... I haven't forgotten... Let me post it on the first post... Il keep doing more so that it can be more clear

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Good Thread, Informed, I also trade via MA Channels High/Low breakouts, but different. MA Channels do work for variety of reasons. This is an interesting spin on it. Questions: 1. How do we gage that price now is above Stop Hunt, price could be back and forth Stop Hunting. 2. As an example for a Buy trade, after we determine that Stop hunting is finished, we then wait for Pop Up candle to close above the High Channel, then for Reversal candle and then entry as PA breaks High of the reversal Candle? 3. What happens if it was a real momentum breakout and Reversal candle is too far from the High of the Channel? 4. Why do we need a middle Channel(I am sure there is a use for it)? Suggestion: Let's stick for now with examples for Forex Pairs and CFD Indices.

Nice addition, like it!

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14454079

--- 帖子 #72 ---
HI Informed, your system becomes clearer and more defined. Thank you for your constant explanations. It seems to me that the key level is the "stop hunt level", because when a candlestick closes above this level, and then a pullback occurs, an entry could happen soon after. So, could you please clarify your method to draw the stop hunt level correctly? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Why you don't open buy trade at the close of the candle which break the stop hunt level? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Please read Post 1. The entry is at the break of the PB candle after a close above/below the stop hunt level.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I agree with you, stop hunter level is the key but for me I don't understand very well where to place stop hunter level (for example on AUDUSD H1 chart above, for the recent bullish sentiment on H4).

--- 帖子 #76 ---
More examples with H1 chart, please

Is it a right buy setup on this GBPUSD chart below? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Greetings It may benifits you to go back and read post one.. Maybe digest it for a while. Thank you

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Please refer also to post 1 where Informed has explained exactly this GBPUSD setup you mentioned... https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...6?d=1686252362

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Is this correct for current AUDUSD price action?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
The marked level on H1 could become a stop hunt level, but it is not (yet). You will know if it is broken to the downside and then price closes above. After a pull back and break of the candle, this would be your entry. Study the posts of Informed and you will understand.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Okay thank you. Just thought it will be worthwhile to note where the stop hunt level resides before the stop hunt PA manifests.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Sorry but I don't understand what is wrong with my buy setup below? Attached Image (click to enlarge) On the chart on post #1 it is noted: Entry at high of the pull back candle? But when we must open a trade: at the next close/open candle, when the price break the high of pull back candle?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Clearly described in post 1 - entry at the break of pullback candle.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
New account long time trader. I created a script/indicator with PineScript on TradingView that sits at the top of the chart. These dots represent the EMAs on the 4H - dots will be BLUE if price is above the bands, red if they’re below, and not appear if they’re in between. This indicator makes seeing setups at a glance infinitely easier but not necessary at all.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Is it correct set up? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Greetings Thank you very much for your interest in the method but please read the first post so you may comply. Your script idea is of note.. Dm me plz

--- 帖子 #88 ---
understood, deleted post

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Greetings The ISR Method is a new concept to many, so there will be abit of confusion just like a small child beginning to walk. For some they will be able to catch the concepts as soon as they read the first post on the thread but for some it will take time( we all don't understand at the same pace) Remember I am still adding information on the first post so that we may all come to the same page(there are concepts I still need to add on). I'd like to thank those that have been assisting the others to understand (much appreciated). The Stop hunt level will be mastered by you in due time(don't panic) We are on a journey not a small trip so please give yourself time to get the concepts with patients

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I don’t think this setup is has a high win rate… with the indicators added to my chart I can clearly see when h4 candles cross bands and I can see see the price hint and a lot of times price doesn’t run after. it’s a sound concept, but it’s still a gamble wether it not price decides to run or not this is normal 1h chart with htf bands (blue) and htf candles

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Yes... As long as the sentiment is still in your favor

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I do hope your moving to the traditional ISR method indicator with no addition of scripts that I haven't checked for consistency in the method Then also to add - your issue is calibration in the Forex market that you still haven't come to fully understand compared to the simple price action in the stock market. I have posted certain pairs to help you begin to walk like a new born child into the ISR method. And yes you now have your eyes opened to see how often the market makers keep coming back for your stop which varies in different pairs and markets

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Informed, I am not sure why you answered 8tango, that this is not correct setup, this setup is exactly as per your first post .. what is not there? You may want to give quick concise answers.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
The setup that he posted is the set up on the first post. The entry is not at the close of the candle but at the high of the pullback candle

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Yes, Got It. Few questions: 1. How do we gage that price now is above Stop Hunt? Price could be back and forth Stop Hunting. 2. What happens if it was a real momentum breakout and Reversal candle is too far from the High/Low of the Channel? 3. Why do we need a middle Channel?

I have never traded stock. Will look at it in due course' Many thanks for your time

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Great post bro! Very detailed and easy to understand. I will code a MT5 indicator and MT5 EA based off of the setup. Keep up the great work

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Good Idea for MT5, what would be the rule/condition "if, then" to measure that Stop Hunting is over - that is the most tricky part that I cannot figure out the answer to. Of course PA will do what PA will do, but what would be the starter rule for it?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Well we can avoid the stop hunting if we wait to trade on each trend change (soon as the bullish sentiment is confirmed we buy, soon as the bearish sentiment is confirmed we sell). Will have a better idea once I finish coding in all of the requirements, then I can look at it visually in the strategy tester to see if its working as intended.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Informed, The strategy says that we enter buy stop above the high of the pull back bar. Is there a set allowance to be given or it is discretionary; and again where the stop hunt level is far from the EMAs and price close back above the SHL, in this case where do we put the stop loss? Still below the EMAs? do you also sometimes move trades to break-even after some positive pips? Thanks

The M15 Breeze Setup Greetings I S R Brothers and Sisters My hearts and desire is to share the knowledge of the financial markets with nothing held back and nothing charged at any price except for the price of your willingness to learn . I was inspired by such traders like Trader101(who is late) who without a reason shared freely his discoveries in the forex market. My Friend Breeze bought to my attention something interesting that I have over looked but may be proving to be of some great advantage in the forex market, therefor Iv decided to dedicate this trade setup in his name for the good heart he has shown towards me in the financial market. I will link this post to the first page since i am no no longer able add any more pictures cause of the limit. The M15 Breeze Setup 1. We start of with the sentiment as always on the H4 2. We then find our SHL on the H1 (remember its the low or high of the induction) 3. Then we drop to the M15 to trade the entry - If bullish the entry will be above the ema wave and SHL - If bearish the entry will be below the ema wave and SH L - The Stop loss will be place below or above the ema wave We are basically waiting for price to stop hunt first on the SHL then come back to Run for profit. My brother Breeze bought to me attention the time in which the Markey makers will be moving the price which is the London or New York session. This might seem like it has been over preached to be a revelation of some sort but the interesting setups that have come from this acknowledgement have me thinking. 4. When the price action confirms a bearish swing in the London new York or creates a new swing within the session that is where we enter for a risk to reward ratio of 1:2( See images for explanation ) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I know I will have a lot of questions for this E ntry Setup still as I'm also still exploring into it but please reread every thing written so that you wont ask questions already dealt with. Posting trades Rules for the Breeze setup - All post are to have three charts for this setup a) The H4 Sentiment Chart b) The H1 Chart for SHL c) The M15 Chart with marked SHL,Entry and SL( add take profit if trade has been closed) I posted pairs on the first post that are less of a headache then the others. I will be editing this post!!!!!!!!!

Will address on post but for bull its above SHL and EMA WAVE with a zig zag following.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I like to get into the trades as early as possible. I am just thinking aloud. Question: Why you do not think that SH is where my arrow showing? My other arrow showing the potential entry PR, way earlier then on your charts.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I don't know if it's a correct method to find SHL level but I think that it's easy method. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #135 ---
That is fine, you are entering "the bounce" and early, as I would, but you are not entering above the SHL (per author suggestion). I propose entering above the SHL is too late for R:R

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Greetings I will be doing a post to Adress the Stop hunt level but I realise that alot of you need to go back and reread all the meterial again because certain things have already been addressed. (re-do your homework) Thank you

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Informed, most of us, who are left understand your technique. As you are not posting your reasoning to get into the trade a bit late, i .e above the SH, we are expanding our research into the earlier entries.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
May I ask, Why 60 EMA? I am not questioning the method here , just asking if there is any particular reason for using 60 EMA, instead of any other EMA.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
The reason why you look for entries above the Stop Hunt level is because it's the place where you know that the stop hunting is likely to have ended and the proberbility of a move up or down is possible. It's an after the stop hunt enty. The hunger for an earlier entry always exist but for that one early trade that works alot more trades not rightly executed will burn.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Earlier I used the 34 then the 50 but after I switched to the 60 my entry accuracy improved. You don't have to struggle where I struggled.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
You don't have to struggle where I struggled.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
It would be nice to have custom indicators for the ISR method For mt4/Mt5 and TradingView So if you have any experience coding please talk to me.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I agree with your reasoning, FOMO will kill. But bad R:R may kill earlier. But, in general, I understand, thank you.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
One thing I was hesitant to say or post about is my experiment of the same logics used on the M15 used on the 5min. But that is still highly expiremental... As long as the entry is above the SHL(IMPORTANT)

--- 帖子 #145 ---
It's really great having you here.. You keep us all on our feet... Il also do my best to present the best information possible.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I suggest, do not go for 5 or 15 Min, it is TMI and brings confusion. I would just stick with 4 Hr and 1 Hr timeframes. I am a convert myself. I traded my spin on MA Channels on 15 Min, but 2 years ago converted to an 1 Hour TF and have not looked back.

Informed, looking closely at your technique, what you are really doing is entering pullback #2 and above the Stop Hunting. I like to enter on the first pullback. Obviously both methods have Pros and Cons. Positive: Both methods entering on the momentum of the new trend.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
could we apply the same logic to different time frames you think? Like 15m and 1M on the indices since they move 3X faster and so much more liquid? NAS100 scalper here

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Highly expiremental !!!! Which tf for sentiment? Which tf for SHL? Which tf for entry?

THIS IS NOT THE M15 BREEZE SETUP!!! Just being curious!!!! H1 Sentiment M15 SHL M1 ENTRY Between London and newyork

--- 帖子 #165 ---
There is an indicator created in TradingView based on this logic but they use smaller time frames. This concept derived from ICT concepts right? They seem to be concerned with volume spikes more than anything when it comes to the stop hunt part ah I see he writes this in the description - I'm aware that ICT doesn't use volume as part of his analysis, and often advocates against using volume altogether, however I personally find it to be a great analytical tool in this context.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Informed, what do you think? Looks quite appealing… price breaks previous swing low while simultaneously showing an aggressive volume spike insinuating a stop hunt and smart money is at play. Entry at the SL on the way back up

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Greetings My back ground is Richard D Wyckoff VSA and raghee horner I have a friend currently trading the ICT trading style but as you can see I use the ema wave which would be looked down upon. My Love was the Richard D Wyckoff schematics which embedded the knowledge of Stop hunts and Inductions and in being in the markets I have been able to see how this happens beyond the richard D Wyckoff schematics and trading style. I would love to study ICT(hopefully as soon as possible since iv been hearing good news about him) but for now I'm a ISR method trader

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Opinion on sharing ICT variation of the strategy? Should we focus only on ISR or are all approaches welcomed?

I debuted in the thread with an operation, although I've been following it for days. Thanks for sharing. Testing a possible configuration in GBPNZD with H4 and H1, is it correct? One question, if the retracement candle is followed by several retracements, does the buy level also adjust to the new high of each bearish candle? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Greetings Thank you for being a part of this family. if there are new highs after the bearish candle You would have been triggered into a trade, but I would like to congratulate you on getting the SHL right.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Beautifull!!!! You are on fire!!!! also remember to post the sentiment H4 time frame

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I have not explained myself well, I mean if there are, for example, 3 bearish candles in the retracement, the buy stop order would be on the maximum of the first bearish candle or we would go down to the new maximums of the bearish candles formed, in this case about the high of the third bearish candle?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Do we absolutely need third time frame, it’s definitely overwhelming. The 15M time frame seems to just be there for pin point entries, but with such large stop losses, doesn’t seem entirely necessary

--- 帖子 #195 ---

Sorry for the long delay, here is the indicator I built off of this method. It's using the forex method described for the 4 hour sentiment chart with 1Hour setup chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buy/Sell signals as described as well. This will probably need some edits so please test and let me know if you spot anything off or see anything that can be improved. I will be finishing the EA version as soon as we confirm that the indicator version is working completely as intended.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Informed, here are signals as of June 7, are they correct and per your technique?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Greetings Thank you for you work concerning an indicator to assist with the sentiment identification without a need to switch to the H4 time frame. I will be testing it by this weekend since I'm on a road trip at the moment. Have a great weekend all

--- 帖子 #204 ---
of course... I should thank you for that..

--- 帖子 #205 ---
it will be very nice if somebody can code this strategy and make backtesting on it.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Thanks for coding it! When switching through different time frames the trendline stays flat in one direction sometimes, but it recovers after a few more switches. And there is an Error "Array out of Range":

Greetings Concerning indicators for the ISR method ill be giving guidance. I'm in contact with the coder so that a good indicator for the ISR method is given which will be to assist with the technical analysis. The image doesn't portray what the ISR method is yet, but hope is not lost because we are a work in progress and we will eventually get it right.

As I understand from the first post, SHL is at the lowest low of a bearish candle (in an uptrend) or the high of a bullish candle (in a downtrend) or a doji candle. I don't know if I think that's right, if I'm wrong, please correct me. thank you very much

That was a very good and patient trade. Informed, do you not think that 10 hours waiting for induce and 21 hours for entry is too long(see area with arrow) and PA has a different motive now then before? Would you say it is a high risk trade because of it? In my personal trading, patterns are obsolete after 5-10 hours.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Induce in Tokyo session, Stop hunt in London session and Entry in New york session that is the best timing for a trade. Me personally, the total time from Induce to Entry is no more than 24 hours and Entry will be best in London to New york session. You can check my M15 chart to see it more clearly.

Setup works great!! Killer play on USDCAD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Went crazy on AUDUSD too Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's the updated version of the indicator: Attached File(s) ISR v1.1.ex5 20 KB | 264 downloads The bottom window/separate window shows us the current sentiment of the 4 hour timeframe (red is bearish, beige is neutral, and blue is bullish). As soon as the 4 hour sentiment switches, it will automatically switch. The window will only show the 4 hour sentiment , even if your chart is on a different timeframe. The arrows are based off of the 1 hour setup that Informed explained, however we are still updating the SHL. Currently you will see a buy arrow if the 4 hour sentiment is bullish, and the previous candle closed above the 1 hour wave. You will see a sell arrow if the 4 hour sentiment is bearish, and the previous candle closed below the 1 hour wave. For now, don't take the arrows blindly . Use your knowledge of the SHL and only take the setups that align with your analysis. Once we add in the SHL to the indicator, then I will have the candles changing colors based upon the 4 hour sentiment. Then lastly I will make it into an expert advisor.

THE M15 BREEZE FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY Greetings I S R traders, I would like to establish the M15 breeze setup as a good way to engage in the crypto market . Crypto currencies can have a really great structure which allows for a good solid ISR setup to form along with its great price movement out of the ISR trading range. Pairs with the USDT are the most suitable in that they give less of a pain in choppy market environments. The beautiful thing concerning this market is not that its open 24/7(fools game to trade and time) but its unlike stocks that doesn't allow for a leveraged position(not all the time). The one main change in trading the M15 Breeze for this market is that you look for the entries between the US Open and Asian Close Every thing else is the same and should the be other changes I will up date this post H4 Attached Image (click to enlarge) H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) M15 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will keep up dating this post

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Greetings to all! I would like to take this opportunity to express my wholehearted gratitude to Informed for the invaluable contributions he made in initiating and upholding this thread. your unwavering dedication and tireless efforts are truly praiseworthy. When considering the system itself and from a technical standpoint, it is more accurate to classify this system as trend-following rather than a reversal system. This distinction provides a significant advantage, as trend-following strategies tend to yield favorable results in many scenarios, further enhancing its edge.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
The Anatomy of a Stop Hunt Level IMPORTANT!!! 1. What is a Stop Hunt Level SHL stand for stop hunt level or rather a place where the market makers(syndicate traders) come back to trigger stop losses along with convincing you to go the wrong direction. The place where you will find the SHL is the place where there are alot of emotions of fear because it's the place where you were convinced by the price action to place your stop loss. This place is what we at the ISR method call the stop hunt level. 2. Where is a SHL The Stop hunt level is found below the low of the swing for a bull market and on top of the swing high for a bear market. You may have more than one SHL to consider but the one that's the best to consider will be the one that is at the lowest point of the Stop hunt for a bull market and at the highest point for a bear market. When you practice with patience you will develop a skill to be able to find the best SHL with ease. ​​​​​​3. How to find the SHL In the forex and crypto market we look for the Stop Hunt Level(SHL) in the H1 time frame. Step1 Look for a bull-bear-bull candle formation above the ema wave(for bull market. What we are really looking for is a swing, a place that entices traders to enter the market and encourage them to put their stop losses at the lows. For this first step it may be that the three candle formation is not what appears but a bullish swing with a high-low-higher high. The low of that swing is the perfect place you are seduced to place your stop loss. Please remember according to the I S R Method this first high must be above the ema wave then the bear can be lower or higher than the ema wave then later there higher high(a bullish price swing) In a live market environment you would draw the highest LOW to the top then plot also the SHL's that the price might also come to should the stop hunt drop any lower. You will know that it's the lowest point that the market will hunt by the reaction in this area along with a entry of the M15 Breeze Setup in the M15 time frame. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Important variations Bull candle/candles - doji - bull candle/candles Bull candle/candles - dragon fly - bull candle/candles Bull candle/candles - inside bar - bull candle/candles Bull candle/candles - hammer - bull candle/candles Step 2 After you have drawn the SHL watch how the market comes to the level and rejects the low. This is where the people with the stop losses are triggered and discouragement is high for that trade long direction. When you see the price come to this level and close above it then you know you might have found the perfect sweet spot. The price might continue to play around this level or go even lower to another SHL. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Step 3 The M15 time frame will show you when the MM are ready to move the price out of this trading range by raising the price above the SHL and ema wave with a following bull-bear-bull swing or you can call it a zig zag(In the right market session) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This Post will be Edited as time goes...

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Thank you bro.. How to spot the SHL noted very well... Next that I am still confused on is how to enter a trade, because sometimes price after breaking the SHL and pulls back it will still go back to the SHL area again and still comes back making me confused on how or when to enter, I will be watching closely to see if you will touch more hint on the entry aspect of this.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #288 ---
By your question I can tell that you read the 1st post quickly and didn't take the time to digest every point made in it. I have posted more information concerning the SHL but you will need to also go back and reread the 1st post to get all the details you need..

COMMERCIAL BREAK

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Quasimodo or Over-Under pattern was coined by a ForexFactory member. It has been incorporated into Supply &amp; Demand strategies which are different from ICT concepts. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...brainer-trades https://paracurve.com/2009/06/over-a...r-pattern.html In reality, it's actually a classic chart pattern called a Crown (Bullish or Bearish Crown) which incorporates a trendline break. It's a form of head of shoulders except that you attempt to get in earlier on the Right Shoulder instead of after the break of the neckline. Some people include Fib Retracement and Extension levels and becomes a modified Gartley pattern. Some people wait for the previous swing to be broken first. It's up to you how you want to incorporate different technical analysis methodologies to improve the edge. Just be aware it might end up causing more analysis paralysis, missed moves or frequent stop-outs. Attached Image (click to enlarge) An old video explaining the concept of the Crown. Inserted Video At the end of the day, the phenomenon being traded here is a break of structure (indicating a possible reversal) and a retracement. You can trade it as a HTF big reversal, or as continuation pattern itself on a LTF as part of a HTF trend. I agree that ICT and his bandwagoners dress up what are basic chart patterns with a lot of unnecessary jargon. If you're studied classic TA patterns, then you realise it's a lot of repackaging though I do combine some ICT concepts as an alternative form of TA.

You're welcome. TTrades is great. He explains ICT concepts succinctly. I'm also exploring a similar concept where i'm attempting to ride a trend shown by an EMA but entering after a Stop-Hunt (after Liquidity has been taken).

Hi Informed first of all thanks for this thread as a new trader i learned many things but i have some troubles about spot the SHL in charts do you know any indicator or any advice for the spot them easily ?

Greetings Thank you very much for blessing us with your presence here at the ISR METHOD Thread. I would like you to please stick to the ISR Method as it is the topic of this thread and not to stray with other forms of technical alaysis in terms of posting here... Read the 1st post carefully so you may be able to comply with the trading method . Thank you

[quote=cliffjaded;14476168]{quote} Isn't this the Box setup aka Quasimodo (QML)? Inserted Video [/quthe ote] the ISR is in fact a QM setup, however, it's a trend-following system - Continuation QM. what I've noticed with the video shared is, he`s showing Reversal QMs. which is risky business, traders love to pick tops and bottoms

That's okay. The setup is not ripe yet, it might as well do whatever it likes. And by the way trades are supposed to come with stop loss for capital preservation in case the market does the unexpected.

What do you think if we use SL above / below the Stophunt zone, and TP with R:R 1:1 for every trades? I have EP 1 stopped out too.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi, all Thanks Informed for posting, I agreed with this idea, I have another idea to make the entry on the chart for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes to avoid a lot of loss (recently I had a lot of it using the 15 min. chart for entry). It is only my opinion.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Greetings I think it's just about time to do a ISR Threading post(to protect you from trades in a bad market).

--- 帖子 #323 ---
15 Min is an account killer. I trade MA Channels and prefer working with 1 Hr TF.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thanks Informed for starting this thread. Trading systems are normally full of indicators and indicators are lagging so people prefer to trade price but it is very difficult to trade right price at the right place. Your trading method is based on trend that is indeed a great idea to trade in the direction of sentiments. I will definitely follow this thread and test it. I found 4 hr and 1 hr tf better. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi again, i just trying to understand basics just wanted to ask if my setup is true? SHL(in chart i wrote as "STH") points and SL point is it correct if they are wrong what is my mistake thanks.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Lovely thread. Point of note. The Inducement Stop Hunt Run for profits is a great model but I would like to point out that its not always the case that the Market Maker as you call it is after your stops especially in a trending market. In most instances they are exiting their positions slowly as retail money and the crowd steps in to ride the wave. Since the logic is pullback = entry and Market Maker sells to Retail who buys their exit positions. Also from most of the charts shared if you look closely the price pulls back not to look for stops but address the issue of volume imbalance especially where there are fair value gaps. These zones are places where price retraced to then launched to higher highs. The premise was not necessarily stop hunts but volume imbalance as smart money could not put all their orders at once. Good thread by the way. Following keenly.

The Origin The Sweet spot of I S R To be a succefull trader we do not trade all trends just like we do not trade all trade setups. Some setups are more valuable than others and some others of less standard and value. I believe this post should make you as profitable as possible in the Stock Crypto and Forex market trading the ISR method. Today you put yourself on the map as a profitable trader as in mastering the structure of the market within the ISR framework you have positioned yourself to be in a better spot than the 90% of traders(unless they join us) The ISR Threading post is to follow but before it does we have to discus the origin of the sentiment which is the sweet spot of the ISR method setup. When we have inducements and stop hunts in the beginning of the move we are at a better chance of making a profit than when we try to enter the market when it's at a place for a reversal(sudden) The further away from the origin or the conception of the sentiment the more likely the setup will not yield the desirable outcome. The first two setups from the conception of the sentiment are the sweet spots before we catch a big move , the others are good since we have a good understanding of the ISR structure but may not yield at times what we desire for as profitable trade. ISR will put you on the map once you engage your focus mainly on the sweet spot which is the origin of the sentiment. There is no need for me to go into depth concerning the entry style because it is exactly what you have been doing and it is what I have always been posting on. The emphasis thus follows A) Trade mainly the 1st ISR structure that emerges after the sentiment is established B) Trade the 2nd ISR structure should you miss or the 1st structure was unclear C) Slam dunk that trade with a risk of 1:5 D ) Move stop loss to break even as soon as the trade reaches a 1:1.5 or 1:2 (its your choice) E) I mainly leave the sl at break even until TP D) Don't you dare complain about lack of trades !!! G) You may also exit the trade when the price touches the 3ema wave on the H4 for as much pips as you want after the 1:5 target is met. The Reset The reset of the Sentiment for the Origin is when the price on the H4 touches the ema wave then afterwards has a bullish close(for bull sentiment) or Bearish close(for Bearish Sentiment) - basically after the sentiment has been established but price then comes back to the 3ema we rinse and repeat since it is a restart of the origin. You have seen the setup work now we put it in the sweet spot. I have pledged to with hold no information from you but to do my best to release it in a way that will benifit and at a pace I can be able to teach with no headache . I hope this will help you to start concluding the ISR method approach even though in the market we are always learning.

Nice! Exactly what i was wondering today, thank you so much for sharing

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi, Informed Thank you for the input, respect. And I believe that this will change our profitability ... I know that this is not a scalping methodology, a certain period of time must pass to see .... What are your favorite stocks that you use for this method on trading view if you use them at all?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Has anyone entered gbpnzd. ..Not a very clear signal, but I would take it if I had noticed ..

--- 帖子 #353 ---
In my opinion, SHL is not correct according to Informed, that is my opinion, not an assertion

--- 帖子 #354 ---
So, again, it's not a very clear signal. But in my opinion it can be detected as a sign. You can see the black reverse candle and then induce on mine H1 chart, differently than on your H1 chart... different brokers..

Hi Informed, Sorry for my impatience One more question about the reset of the Sentiment if you don't mind... which does not give me peace..... I have three options of reset of the Sentiment. First clear ...price just touches the ema wave then afterwards has a bearish close. Then we continue look setups according origin bear sentiment, ok. But other two when price goes deeper to wave, can be considered valid variants as a restart of the origin sentiment? Pictures below

The idea of the method is look like of one of the principles of PVSRA. At the PVSRA we see the P.A do a zig-zag pattern, price ends the stophunt in the region 2.07000 (Whole Level), accumulates below the 200 EMA with notable volume (changing the positions) and rises above the region 2.07250 (Quarter Level), above the Dragon EMA (EMA WAVE) too. In PVSRA is a Trend Validated Trade for 20 pips (more or less) I know you will find answers to these moves the more you work on your method, stay green bro. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yea, for now I would just try out in demo to get a feel of the strategy. The best is always first setup from the H4 I think.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Gleam, So the candle if it closes within the EMA wave, is it invalid? If it's bullish but still inside the EMA, is that also invalid? Hope you can clarify when H4 sentiment becomes invalid, because you said yesterday that as long as the candle does not close on the other side of the EMA wave, it stays valid (Post 380)

--- 帖子 #399 ---
You got it right....your entry was toooo early.. Look New SHL after H4 bullish candle closed..

--- 帖子 #400 ---
After bullish candle closed we continue looking buy setup . If H4 bearish candle closed to other side of wave would be new bearish sentiment as I said yesterday...But some question still need to be clarified by Informed in my post: ISR Method | Page 19 | Forex Factory .

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Yes, your questions in this post are similar to mine. Just needed to be sure where a sentiment becomes valid/ invalid exactly when the candles are within the EMA wave.

--- 帖子 #402 ---

Hi everyone, I have to ask a few questions. Q#1: Can the pullback should always have only one candle? or it may be consist of more than one candles? Q#2: If their is an established biasing (bullish/bearish) and after identifying the SHL, while looking for Trade in M15. And eventually, Price enters in the EMAs Band in H4 and giving a signal in M15. Should we enter in market with previous bias, or wait for the H4 candle to close out of EMA Band? Q#3: We trade in London/New York session, should we close our entries at end of NY Session, or just this is the rule to take entry only in Ln/Ny Session? Thanks for answering these questions. #I was looking for ISR method, and found these difficulties while judging/taking a trade. Stay Blessed

I want to give some of my thoughts. 1. Trade with the major trend: OP uses four-hour timeframe to check the sentiment. If you have a macro view on a market, you know the sentiment and you won't trade against it. It's in your bone. Sometimes price might pierce the ema(60) channel with opposite direction of the major trend. It's a little dangerous to do purely technical IMO. 2. Find swing high/low for liquidity: OP uses one-hour to find an area where liquidity lies and traders get trapped. I also include higher timeframe to weekly and lower timeframe to 15-minute. Lower timeframes could end up a scalp trade and higher timeframe could end up a positional trade. 3. Entry on fifteen-minute timeframe Although OP uses high, low ema(60) retest and breakout, I could see several setups could be valid and also shares the same idea as OP. Actaully, any reversal setup is good. ------------------- Everything is fractal. A 4-hour candle is composed of 4 hourly candles, 16 15-minute candles, 48 5-minute candles or 240 1-minute candles. But the macro trend won't change. Lower timeframes give more setups but more fake reversals. So, it's a scalp trade. 1R is good for me. Also you could trade a counter major trend setup here because any pullback from a major trend is large enough for scalping. You need a good hit rate and more trades in scalping. Higher timeframes give less setups but better reversals. Aim for more Rs because you probably get yourself a true reversal. Do not trade against a major trend on higher timeframes because it probably won't turn back.
