Hello People, I have surfed and learnt quite a fair bit from the different forex forums eversince I started forex trading. It's time I contribute. Here's an EA I wrote to automate my trading experience. I call it the " Forex Trend Catcher EA". As it's name imply, it wil attempt to "catch" trends when it detects a developing trend emerging. A few things about this EA. 1. It is designed for trading on the 1hr time frame. 2. It will stop initiating new trades at end of each trading week, Friday 15:00 GMT. 3. EndWeekCloseAll option to auto close all open trades at end of each trading week, Friday 19:30 GMT before forex market closes. Otherwise, all existing open trades get carried over to the next trading week. 4. TrailingStopRequired option to trail profits made. Otherwise, no trailing of profits. 5. TradeNewYorkOpen option to trade/not trade before New York opens for trading. 6. TradeLondonOpen option to trade/not trade before London opens for trading. 7. It refers to indicator TrendRange_bars to initiate trades. *Ensure that you download version 1f from post #1, and not the outdated version 1a from post #3. I cannot remove post #3, for some reason the "edit" button does not show. Happy trading. Bernard

This zipped up file says on my pc that it is coruppted... I cannot open it... soeasy69 Can you post it with no zipped up file?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi, Sorry for the corrupted zip file. Here's the attached executable file below. Regards, Bernard.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks... soeasy69... no source code?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Is this EA based on "Trend Manager?" soeasy69

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi prosper4ex, I have downloaded your ex4 file and am putting on my $10000 and $250 Demo a/c. Will get back to you with results after it trades a few. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi soeasy69, I have spent hours testing and programming this EA. To be fair to myself, I won't be releasing the source code after all the hard work done. It will just get copied and released under different names. Bernard

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I do not know what "Trend Manager" you refer to. But, this EA is a trend following EA. Bernard

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi vinesh, Let me know if you have any questions about the EA. Bernard

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I forgot to add. You can change the parameters within the properties of the EA to suit your requirement. Please remember to set your GMToffset to be in line with your broker's time. Bernard

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hey Bernard..... Thanks for sharing. Do you mind if I ask what pairs you like to trade this EA on and what settings you use for those pairs. Thanks again. Damon

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Bernard... It's just that so many people think they have some holy grail EA or indicator and all it is in the end is a SMA or EMA... There is no secrets to trading like a lot of traders think... Knowing how to use a SMA or EMA in the right way can make you money... I know one thing for sure that your EA is based on a moving average...they all are... please don't take me in the wrong way just being honest... I have it on the GBPUSD H1 to see what she can do... I hope she makes some pips bro... thanks for posting it... But I also want to say that they can decompile it for $10.00 just so that you know... so if this EA is a winner you can be sure somebody will do that... Me I will just run it for fun to see... soeasy69... Thanks again...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I have it on IBFX will that work on 3? Sorry but I don't understand what to set it at? soeasy69

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi damonl, I trade all pairs as long as the spread is 10 and below. The EA takes a while to "catch" a trending currency pair. So, best to widen the number of currency pairs to trade to increase the probability in entering a trade. I set TrailingStopRequired to true to trail my profits and UseMoneyManagement to false. I trade fixed lots of 0.1 per currency pair. Remember to align GMTOffset with your broker's time. Bernard

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi soeasy69, On your demo screen, go to View and select Market Watch. You can see your broker's server time. Compare this time to current GMT time, London at www.greenwichmeantime.com - and you can see your broker's server time is a few hours ahead of GMT. The number of hours ahead is the GMTOffset. Just input the figure into the GMTOffset parameter. Beranrd

--- 帖子 #16 ---
If the offset does not match will it not trade? soeasy69

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thanks anyway... Good luck and good trading soeasy69

--- 帖子 #18 ---
It will still trade. However, the EA is programmed to stop opening new trades on each Friday at 15:00 GMT time. The GMTOffset is needed so that your broker's time is synchronized to GMT time for the EA to work accurately. Bernard

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Prosper, Thanks, I have put it it at default except for MM. I'm using MM and have put it on 4 majors i.e. Eur, Gbp, Aud and E/G. It has not traded yet but as you say it has to catch a 'trend'. Fingers crossed. But do tell me, are your TP and SL realistic? 400/100. SL still is understandable but TP targets? What is your rate of successful trades? Can you post one week's results? Vinesh p.s. On an average how many trades/week/pair can be expected? But even if we can get 1 good trade/week/pair it will be 1600 minus any unsuccessful trades, which happens to be phenomenal (well at least very good) result.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hello prosper4rex, Thanks for posting your EA. Looking forward to testing it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi all, I am very interested in this service, I tried to test it but no trade has been made since yesterday. is ti normal? could you please share with us some statement about it? thanks for everything regards ioopoipoi

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Vinesh, I have traded live manually in the past. 400 pips for TP is realistic but does not happen often, takes a few days to reach. I am still demo-ing this EA, not going live yet. I started tesing it last week 12 March, so it's not even a week yet. But, have cleared most of the bugs discovered along the way. I am demo-ing on instatrader, averaging 4-5 trades a day. Today, I have 7 trades activated by the EA so far. Bernard

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Pluto2, Thank you. Do let me know your feedbacks about the EA's performance. Bernard

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi iopoipoi, That's strange. I am on instatrader demo, managed to get on average 4-5 trades a day. I trade a wide range of currency as long as the spread is 10 pips and below. Can you try trading a wider range of currency pairs? It increase the chances of entering a trade within a short time. Today, I have 7 currency pairs traded. Bernard

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi prosper4rex, Can you tell us some more about what pairs you trade and what your settings are? Maybe you can upload your sets with inputparameters? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thanks bernard I will try it and let you know. thansk for your efforts and support. I hope it will work. thanks Iopoipoi

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I'm not a huge fan of black-box systems. How exactly does this work? Moving averages? Stochastics? Price action? You don't need to tell me the settings. I just want to know what's being used.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Prosper, 48 hours since loaded EA but not a single trade yet. I'm using Forex.com MT4 platform. Enough balance in the a/c. Am I missing something in setting? Risk is set at 1% and MM is on. A/c balance is +$11800, floating loss -$1200 from other trades. Still enough balance to trade. Any advice or comments welcome. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi ssvl, I traded the following currency pairs, eurusd, audusd, gbpusd, nzdusd, usdcad, nzdjpy, usdjpy, chfjpy, gbpjpy, eurjpy, audjpy, cadjpy, eurchf, usdchf, gbpchf,nzdchf, audchf, cadchf, eurgbp, euraud, nzdcad, audcad My setting, GMTOffset = 3; TakeProfit = 400; StopLoss = 100; TrailingStopRequired = true; TrailingStop = 50; StopLossIncrement = 10; EndWeekCloseAll = true; Lots = 0.1; UseMoneyManagement = false; Risk = 10; Slippage = 3; SpreadLimit = 10; Bernard

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Ronald, This is largely an ADX driven system in combination with others. Bernard

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Vinesh, The past 48 hrs, I have the following pairs triggered by the EA - audjpy, chfjpy, nzdjpy, usdjpy, usdchf, eurchf, audusd, gbpjpy, euraud, eurusd I am on instatrader (demo). I don't know why you have none triggered. If too many people cannot get their trades triggered, I may have to loosen the EA's entry requirements a bit. Bernard

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hello Prosper, The EA is trading for me, but there is something I don't understand. Can you please explain why the EA closed the trade at 1.3986 while the terminal is clearly stating TP at 1.3937. Simmilar thing had happened on other 2 trades. Out of the 1h,4h, daily; which do you preffer? Will your EA work with 5 decimal brokers? Do we have to add the additional 0? Thanks for your reply/help Cheers

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Pluto2, For the default setting, the TP is 400. With TrailingStopRequired set to true, The EA keeps advancing the stoploss to around 40 pips away from the current trading price. In an ideal situation, the trend keeps advancing and will eventually hit the TP at 400. However, during the trending period, there are little dips and retracements here and there before it goes back to continue trending again. It is in the last dip, the current price hits the latest stoploss . This will close your trade before reaching the ideal 400 TP. Although the EA is designed for 1HR and higher time frame usage, I have always used it on the 1HR time frame. So, I cannot comment on it's use on the 4HR and Daily timeframe. Yes, the EA is programmed to work with 5 decimal brokers too. Bernard

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Pluto2, I forgot to answer your last question. No, you do not have to add the additional 0. Bernard

--- 帖子 #35 ---
It seems it is only I for whom the EA refuses to work! I tried it on H1 and H4 both. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Prosper I'll try out all the pairs you mentioned and see if it works for me. The surprising thing is that on my platform a pair rarely has more than 5 pip spread! That includes GBP/CHF and GBP/JPY. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Vinesh, On a closer look, try changing your risk to 10%. 1% of your available equity may not be sufficient to trade per 0.1 lot. This is a likely reason for no trades initiated. Bernard

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Vinesh, Your broker's spread is quite good. The lower the spread is to the advantage of the end trader. Bernard

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi, For those who are unfamilial with EA and how to download , install and use it, fill free to post your questions here. You can e-mail/PM me if you wish too. I, or members here will assist you. I have received e-mails asking for help in this area. So, feel free to ask. Bernard prosperin4rex@gmail.com

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Prosper, Thankyou for the ea. I have loaded it on my Demo account and it is running fine. But when I load it on my LIVE account ... nothing. Is there reason why it will not work on my live account. Both accounts are with IBFX. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Mark, E-mail me with your account number with your broker. I will generate a license number for you. The unique license number is generated from the account number. You need this to go live. Bernard prosperin4rex@gmail.com

--- 帖子 #42 ---
prosper4rex, Hello bud, hows tricks? Ok, so here's the deal. I've been a bit p*ssed off with forex the last few days. You know the score, losing trades etc..I'm down about 300 bucks the last 3 days. Anyway, I'm trawling through the threads on FF and I come across this one, namely, Forex Trend Catcher EA. Ok, I think, another flash Harry with a so called "magic EA blah blah blah...." So, I attch the "magic EA" to my floating demo account with about 600 bucks in it. "Ah, what the hell" I think, "What have I got to friggin lose" So, I attach the EA to my demo account, set the parameters to...well.....more or less out of the box apart from GMT time which for me is +2 and go out for a few beers............ So, a few hours later and I return to my PC, a little bit worse for wear but............my demo account is now up by 215.67 bucks and I have floating trades totalling -49.39 bucks So, prosper4rex, have you created an EA that actually does what it says on the box? Seriously mate, it looks good so far and if it can make me a couple o' hundred bucks from a 600 dollar account on a few hours, then I'm mightily impressed. I'll keep you posted!!! Benn

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Okay, while writing that post my floating trades are now at -21.66 bucks........

--- 帖子 #44 ---
ADX was developed largely as a momentum-type indicator. Welles Wilder had something to do with it, I suggest you look him up.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Like all robots they cannot think and make a rational decision they can only do what the simple moving average or MACD or whatever is telling them to do... I think these trades will lose... IMHO! soeasy69

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Judging by that chart, it looks like the EA gets the end of the move... Where did I put that time machine..

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hello Bernard, Thought you (and others) would be interested in my results. By the looks of things it's off to a good start but I'll keep it running on this demo account for a while and see how it goes. Many thanks, Benn.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Benn, Thank you for your favourable comments. I am glad you like it. Yes, do keep us posted on your trading. Bernard

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi soeasy69, I do fully agree with you that EA robots can never make rational decisions as human does. However, between trading manually and trading with an EA, personally I will choose an EA. I have been manual trading for some time, and I can only say this....manual trading is boring, monotonous, testing my patience to the limits, ...and more. I will be sitting at my PC waiting and waiting and waitig for that perfect entry. I think I have done enough waiting to last a lifetime. To me, trading should be easy and a breeze, and even fun too. But, manual trading seems not so. So, I decided - let the robot do all the dirty monotonous work, and I have my fun...out in the fresh air, smelling flowers, sipping coffee/tea with my pals at the malls, shooting the breeze, learning more from the forums and making new friends, watching the world go by.....etc. Why handwash when you can use the washing machine? That's my rational. On a positive note, I saw Benn's trading results which he attached below. (Thank you Benn for posting your results). Contrary to what you have predicted, the GPDUSD actually went into profit, although a small one. Bernard

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Benn, Thank you once again. I really appreciate you posting your trading results. Bernard

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Prosper Thanking you kindly for sharing your EA with the rest of this community. I would like to report that since downloading it yesterday, the EA has generated 4 trades with the following results. 2 x -100 pips. 2 x +400 pips. Total +600 pips in less then 2 days. Although it is early days for me in testing this EA, results appear quite good so far. Many thanks Ezzy

--- 帖子 #52 ---
please can u direct me on how to install ea on mt4 platform

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Does anyone have any open trades at the moment, my platform hasn't had any oipen trades for over 12 hours. Thanks

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hello dunny, Right click on the attachment then save to your pc. Make sure that your Fx platform is closed then right click and copy the trend catcher file. Locate the Experts folder of your Fx software and simply paste the EA into it. Restart your platform and the Trend catcher should now be in your Experts Advisors folder in the navigator on the left hand side of the screen.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I have 3 trades opened today. Nzdusd, aususd &amp; cadusd

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Cheers Mr B It recently opened nzu and au

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Bernard, Here's my second day results from your EA. One trade is floating but its getting late here in Hong Kong and I'm bloomin' knackered! Looking good so far I have to say. Keeping my fingers crossed that this really is good and isn't just a fluke.! Cheers

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi People, I discovered a little bug in the original version, version 1a. It involves the end of week closing function. There is a little computation error there. I have rectified it, and uploaded at the beginning of the thread as Forex Trend Catcher Ver1b.ex4. Please download the rectified copy. Regards, Bernard

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Ezzy, That's some quite awesome trading result you have. Care to upload a screenshot of those trades? Bernard

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi dunny, I see you have help from Benn on this problem. Thank you Benn. dunny, let us know if you have any further problems. Bernard

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi Benn, Impressive results you have. Be sure to download the latest version 1b. Rectified a little bug I discovered. Have a good rest. More pips await you tomorrow. Bernard

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I don't understand why you are all forward testing, do a backtest for 10 years and you are much wiser. Alpari has 1 min data from 2004, just run your hourly test on every tick mode in top of that and you will have a good idea on how the EA works longer term. If you are testing last few days it tells absolutely nothing especially when the days have been as extraordinary as they have. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yes, I have just downloaded it so I'll make sure I have that one up and running from tomorrow. Many thanks for your efforts, it's much appreciated. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Sound great but I am very much an Fx newbie so you're almost talking another language there. Perhaps Bernard can give it a go? Cheers mikkom

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hello Prosper, Looking very goood! Thanks again Cheers

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Prosper, I did get 3 trades 2 were + 1was-. Now I've downloaded v2. Can you tell me how is it different from v1? I have put it at default except GMT offset which is 0 for my broker. Thanks Vinesh

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Ronald, As the name suggests it'll catch a trend which is confirmed and as such you will enter later on only. But I think it's better to have 1 good trade than several losing ones. Better safe than sorry. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Mikkom, In my experience (albeit it is very limited as I'm a newbie too) the results of backtest and forward testings are dramatically different. No two situations in Forex market is the same. I've seen good profits on backtest and the same EA gives loss 70% of the time when tested in forward. Just my 2 bits. Vinesh p.s. Though testing for a long time like a month or two will give you several different scenarios and a better judgement on EA.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
On the contrary =D I would rather have several good trades and few losing ones, especially at the retail forex level (any MT4 broker). Here's why: There are plenty of reasons why a trade may not be filled.. Increased spread Lag with the broker Complete loss of a connection with a broker Very high slippage Power outage etc. Let's say one in every ten trades is a winner. That translates to a 10% chance of a winning trade. What's the likelihood that your winning trade would be affected by one of the above problems? That's why I would prefer several small to medium winners to one large winner, so the broker has a smaller chance of wiping out my only profitable entry.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Pluto2, May you have consistent and profitable trades with this EA. Bernard

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Vinesh, Ver. 1a stop/close trades with the wrong time at end of trading week, Friday. This is now rectified and uploaded as Ver. 1b. Bernard

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Prosper, Looks to me like if I don't want the TS, I not only have to have the TrailStopRequired on false, but the TrailStop at 0 and the StopLossIncrement at 0. Correct? Thanks Cheers

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Pluto2, You just need to switch TrailStopRequired to true/false. No other action is required. Bernard

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi there, It is giving me this message 2009.03.19 20:41:40 Forex_Trend_Catcher_Ver1b EURJPY,H1: Unauthorise Copy is there a number to regist? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi Pedro, You must be using it on a live account. Just e-mail me your account number and I will generate a unique license number from your account number to go with the EA. Bernard

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hello Prosper, Please see my post#32. After reading your reply, I have set the TrailingStopRequired to False. But the same issue as I have posted it in #32 is there. That's why my question in my last post. I like to trade the EA without the TS. Just have a SL and TP. I find the TS takes away too many pips. How can I eliminate the moving of the SL? Thanks again Cheers

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi prosper and all Still demoing this EA My results for yesterday (Sydney time) were as follows; 3 trades, all profitable. trailing stop was hit on all 3 for a total of 240 pips In the last 3 days it has given my demo account an extra 840 pips with only 2 losing trades out of 7 trades. I will try and upload some screen shots ( I will try anyway, I am bit new at posting screen shots). http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Once again thanks for posting this EA prosper. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Pluto2, If you do not wish to activate trailing stops, set the TrailingStopRequired to false. However, whether the TrailingStopRequired is set to true/false, the EA will always move the SL (100) to StopLossIncrement(10) when the trade enters profitable territory (+50). This happens only once. This is a safety feature I wish to remain in the EA , unchanged. You must always lock in profits, at least a minimal profit in any trade. Once this happened, with TrailingStopRequired set to false, the new SL (10) remains until end of trade. No need to change StopLoss or StopLossIncrement values. Let them remain as they are, default values. Bernard

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Ezzy, Great results you have again. Yes, I will appreciate to see screenshots of your trades. Bernard

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks Prosper for the explanation. Now I fully understand how the SL is programmed in your EA. Cheers

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Last two days have been VERY good for anyone trading a trend. Need to know wht happens in normal and/or choppy markets. Might give this EA a try next week.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I have a question. Why do we need unique license number for live account ? Is it becoz u are going to sell this EA soon ? Will the unique license number expire ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Lets see if I can upload these right! 1st the nzus, there were 2 positive trades here. Also the auus, 1 good and 1 bad trade. 3rd, the usch, this one was a big win! This is all in ver1 which I will continue to demo for the next few weeks to get a good idea of how it performs under different circumstances. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #84 ---
for a 5 digit broker like alpari, do i have to add the "0"? eg take profit 4000.00? and if so, do i have to add it also at "risk", "slippage" and "spread limit"? thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
lol thats funny. I've got a EA that I've been working on daily for over 3 years now...interestingly it's still just slightly larger than your file. A few hours ain't nothin.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks for sharing your EA. I have got it on 12 pairs H1, and in the 48 hours since I started the test I had no trades. Checked everything, smiley face, live trading enabled. Can you suggest what else I can look at to get the EA working. Thanking you PipBear

--- 帖子 #87 ---
aser, I didn't have to change anything.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
EA not working on LIVE account. Please advise

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Read the thread ?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
A visual back test on H1 eur/usd reveals a rather eratic stop loss at times? I suspect you are moving the stop to break even? Even with a trailing stop set to false... it seems to bring the stop to b/e far too early

--- 帖子 #91 ---
If you don't trust backtests then why would you trust forward tests? IMHO no strategy is tradeable [for me] if it doesn't last 20 years of backtest. Forward test (with money of course) is just a verification of what the backtests show. Different results on backtest and forward test usually are because one of the following - Incorrect backtest (there are lots of errors that can be made for example testing open prices/control points on small sl) - Curve fitted EA - And finally, the situation ahs really changed. This shouldn't be an option if you have tested 20 years on all majors as I do but of course there are situations where this might happen edit: note that I'm not saying that this EA doesn't work, I haven't tested it. It might work very well - all I want to say that it's impossible to get dataset big enough in forward test so you should really backtest for at least 5 years (prefereably 20) to get the actual results on how the ea works in all different conditions.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Some currencies won't have data stretching 20 years back, imho you can capture most market conditions in currencies looking at a 5-8 year period... A basic backtest on this strategy doesn't seem to pull out profit ... but i'm not sure if there is a bug in the ea...prosper4rex ...can you confirm if your strategy is quick to adjust the S/L to break even?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Here is a bit longer term test for GBPUSD and EURUSD, ask yourself would you really want to trade this (2004-today). Other currencies give similar results. This is why it's important to test on longer periods especially before going live. What I see on tester screen, this seems to be so called averaging EA.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
This EA is available free to anyone who is interested to use it. I have received many e-mails requesting for license number and I have given them away. I do understand that there will that rare individual who will attempt to sell it on the net. The License Number is there for a reason. Bernard

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks for the upload. Bernard

--- 帖子 #96 ---
The EA is programmed to work with 5 digits brokers too. Use the default values, no changes necessary. Bernard

--- 帖子 #97 ---
You may have insufficient total balance to initiate trades. Can you please post your settings here? I will have a better idea. Bernard

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Your request for License Number is in your e-mail. Bernard

--- 帖子 #99 ---
You may want to refer back to the previous page post #78. A similar question was asked and I posted the reply there. Bernard

--- 帖子 #100 ---
There's no bug. The SL is made to advance some distance behind current price. Bernard

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Nice feature I think all EA out there should have this kind of license number to prevent business minded people from making the EA commercial

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi People, Let's not over analyze the EA. I never backtest my EAs as I have mentioned to many. I wrote this EA to free myself from the drudgery of daily manual trading. To have myself more free time, time to really enjoy life. I thought it will be a good idea to post it here, to share - afterall I have learned alot from the many forex forums. It's availabe to any Tom, Dick or Sally. If you like, use it. If, not - just ignore it. I don't wish to be bog down with "how well it should/shouldn't perform based on past data". What matters to me, at the end of the day the EA pulls in the pips for me, the more the merrier. Bernard

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Thanks Bernard ... must have missed that post where you mention about the stop loss movement Didn't want to 'bog you down' with past data results but to ensure it was trading as it was. Good luck DT

--- 帖子 #104 ---
After about 14 hours, it put a USD/CAD short trade and went to a HUGE LOSS . Will update results.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
HUGE LOSS ? The SL is set at 100, It's expected to go from -1 to -100, how huge can it be ?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
.50 lots x 100 pips Sl = 403$ loss

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Prosper4rex, Thank you for sharing your EA. Looking forward to testing your EA on a small live acct. Please see your email. I will be glad to post results and screenshots. Sincerley, Sir Viver.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
if u cannot afford to lose that amount why trade 0.5 lot in the first place? Maybe u should trade 0.1 lot since 0.5 lot seem like big loss to you.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I have another question. I'm not good at mt4 programming but it seems that you are able to get information on our live account name,balance,account number when we use it for live account. It seems like a security risk for us ? I dont know what addition information u could get from the EA u given to us.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Pardon me, but with this attitude, how do you expect to have any but rank amateurs try out your closed code? With this in mind, how can anyone with a better system add their knowledge to your closed mind? Better; open not only your code to your market peers, but your heart as well, for it is then that true wealth is realized by everyone. If brokers had this mindset, then you would be much richer in both bank and level of mental solace, no? Make your code the second of importance with consideration for others, and others will make your code primary importance to give back more than you share. A simple truth from time immemorial. Claude

Prosper, Thank you and others for sharing your EA and assisting others to use it. I have read interesting reviews of your tool and would like to start using it. I am having challenges with where to place your file as my trading software (FX Solutions) does not contain an Experts folder. Would you give me an idea as to how to properly install your EA? I am currently using a demo account. Thanks in advance for your support.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
FX Solutions has no robot setup... try www.fxdd.com or www.ibfx.com then you will need guidance to install the EA... too many words to say if your a newbie to MT4... soeasy69

Please check your e-mail for license number. Bernard

For your information, the information displayed by the EA comes from your broker's server. Your details are on your broker's server when you registered. No one have access to that information except your broker. I resent what you are implying. Bernard

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Although it's true that the information is on the broker's server, it's very possible to use an EA to access that information. AccountBalance() Tells you the account balance AccountCompany() Returns the brokerage company name where the current account was registered. AccountCredit( ) Returns credit value of the current account. AccountCurrency( )Returns currency name of the current account. AccountEquity( )Returns equity value of the current account. Equity calculation depends on trading server settings. AccountFreeMargin( )Returns free margin value of the current account. AccountLeverage( )Returns leverage of the current account. AccountName( )Returns the current account name. AccountMargin( )Returns margin value of the current account. AccountNumber( )Returns the number of the current account. AccountProfit( )Returns profit value of the current account. AccountServer( )Returns the connected server name. All of the data pulled from these functions can be used to send information to your server prosper. How do I know that's not happening?

hi bernard trend catcher opened 2 trades yesterday, au/us nz/us both were buys, and both opened above the support1 line, where i find it would be difficult to get 400pips anyway, one closed at $1.00 and the other at -$58.25,using default settings, so i think there maybe something wrong with the entry critia

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hello Bernard, I installed the later version of your EA yesterday and it went about its business of trading, ok, no problem here. However, it's now Saturday, my broker is closed for the weekend and I have 2 trades still open. Wasn't the new version supposed to close down trades before the close of business? Or is it ok to have trades open over the weekend. I have never done that in the past with manual trading so I'm a little unsure. Anyway, thanks for the input and I look forward to more demo testing next week before I go live with it. Cheers! Benn

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Then again, just how many times have we seen such code appear for sale on ebay? He has all the right in the world not to post the code he worked on in a public forum for rip off artists to profit from. It should not be seen as being stingy at all in my opinion, his concern is simply, good common sense.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Can you upload a screenshot of your results? It will be easier for me to analyze. Bernard

--- 帖子 #120 ---
it does not protect the source code by only posting the compiled code, in fact decompiling it only takes a few seconds. If it does nothing to protect it, why not post it and allow others to improve upon it?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
There is a bug in the End Of Week Closing Trades. I'll have to re-work it a bit over the weekend. Bernard

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Ok Bernard, no problem. I'll continue to test the latest version anyway and keep you posted with the results. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Will upload before end of next week after some testing. Bernard

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Prosper4ex, I just add the EA on 12 currencies and had the USD/CAD put in a trade to sell. You don't need a Magic Number in the EA? Can it put trades even if you have the EA on all those Currencies?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
The EA uses Magic Number. Yes, it can put trades with the EA running on all currency pairs. Bernard

--- 帖子 #126 ---
OK Thanks I just have USD/CAD to sell right now. I put the EA on the charts an hour ago. I am +14 pips now

--- 帖子 #127 ---
How do you think it would work on the Daily Time Frame??

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Off to a good start, AUD/USD triggered long, up 35 pips as of now, IBFX live micro acct. Sir Viver.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
prosper4rex can u enable your PM ? I cannot PM u. Thnx

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Prosper, i cant seem to be able to download the file. Which program can be used to open files under Ex4 extension? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Bernard, Thanks for sharing your EA. I would like to test the EA on my FXDD micro live account and I have sent you an email requesting a license number for the EA.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Nice one there, Sir Viver. Bernard

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I have never tried it on Daily TF. Maybe, someone else from this thread has. It should work similarly as on 1HR TF. Bernard

Hi Could someone post some results of the past week ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi prosper I am wondering, what kind of results you got last week. Thanks Ezzy

--- 帖子 #139 ---
should we off the EA for the hour if there is news ?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi Prosper What else needs to be donloaded to demo this ea Thank you

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Can anyone eplain how do u shange a EX4 ext ro a MQ4 ext

--- 帖子 #142 ---
u need to pay $ to do that. There are people out there providing mt4 decompile service.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi all Please ignore my last 2 posts I wasnt using my head I do have the EA up and running Thank tou

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I though u were drank becoz u didnt type properly

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I will try it on Daily TF. I trade them anyway

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Let us know how it work out. Daily TF need bigger SL ? The 1H TF hardly got any trade, daily chart gonna be worst ? Maybe u have only 1 trade per week.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Was up 54 pips. I like how stop moves to + 10 pips once profit of 50 pips is hit. Currently up 24 pips. Sir Viver.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Forex Thank you for noticing the spelling errors. But you dont do so well yourself

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Well, to be honest, I had a little bit of volka.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I like that idea too. Locking in profit and letting the profit run.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
To tell you the truth i sit here surrounded by all kinds of booze in a liquor store And i dont drink at all . My fingers must have slipped

--- 帖子 #152 ---
thanks prosper

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Yes SL I have set it at 150. Will keep an Eye out. I guess with this method the computer stays on all the time to wait for trend Catcher

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Had 4 trades USD/CAD in at 1.2366 sell SL hit at 1.2346 for 20 pips=$16.20 GBP/CHF in at 1.6329 buy SL at 1.6349 close at 1.6366 for 17 pips=$33.02 EUR/GBP in at 0.9392 sell SL hit at 0.9332 for 60 pips=$87.04 USD/CHF in at 1.1220 sell SL hit at 1.1320 for -100 pips= (-$88.34) So made in total $47.92 in four trades still ahead

Personally , I just let the EA run as it is. Bernard

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Nice one, Sir Viver. Bernard

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hello Bernard &amp; everyones else following this thread. I have attached my results from yesterday. Please note that the first 2 trades are carry overs from Friday because the EA doesn't close Friday trades down yet. I believe Bernard is fixing this. Just out of interest, I started using the EA last Wednesday on a small account of US691.76. First results were posted in post #47. Cheers guys, happy trading! Benn

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Bertnard,.... I have been testing the EA on my FXDD Demo account for 2 days, but so far no trade has been triggered yet. Also on my FXDD real account for 24 hours, and no trade at all. Please advise what might be wrong

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Thanks for posting your results. Bernard

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thanks. Nice results. Bernard

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Very encouraging results. Thanks for posting your latest results , Benn. Bernard

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Belka, There are a few possibilities I can think of at the moment. 1. Disconnection issues with your broker's server. 2. Insufficient available equity to trade. 3. Trading far too few currency pairs. Care to post your settings here for me to see? Bernard

--- 帖子 #166 ---
How much do we need in order to trade 1,000 base currency unit ?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
hi bernard, the EA doesnt seem to work for me. I have 10k in my demo account but so far (1 day) n no trades done. Pls advise, thanks

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Bernard, Thanks for your advice. I install the EA on my FXDD demo account with $10500 equity. Here is the setting, please review it and advise if it needs changes.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Bernard, just want to inform you the EA just triggered a buy trade USD/CAD on my FXDD demo account. I suspect the problem before was my internet connection disconnected intermittently

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Prosper, I am getting a few trades with the EA. Just wanted to know how does SL Increment work? It did move my stoploss to +50 pips but is not following the win as I thought it would. It is set at default. Can you please clarify this point? I am using version 2. Thanks, Vinesh

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Prosper, I was finally successful using getting your EA on my platform. Is there a version 2 for your EA?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
southamp, Please upload a screenshot of your chart and your settings. I wil look into your issues. Bernard

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Belka, Congratulation on getting your first trade going. You may want to update your GMTOffset to a correct value. The details are at page 1, post #15. Bernard

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Vinesh, With StopLossRequired set to true, everytime the current price is +50 pips away from SL, the SL will be increased by +10 pips, thereby trailing behind current price and locking your profits in. Additional info on page 3, post #33. Bernard

--- 帖子 #175 ---
MrRolf, That's great. Welcome to the world of EAs. Version 2 is Version 1b which you have downloaded. Version 1 (Version 1a) was the original version. Bernard

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi I'am testing this EA on live account with LiteForex After my first 24hours it took one trade on EUR/CHF -100 pips. During the test it runs on 6 pairs. EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, EUR/CHF.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Prosper, Thanks for your reply. I ended up with less than 50% profit if I had closed it manually, so it did go up by further 50 pips but the SL didnt trigger second time. Vinesh p.s. FYI only.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Gajowy, Thanks for the upload. As in all trading, do expect some trades to go against you. Don't take this EA as the holy grail - there's none. Bernard

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Vinesh, Please upload your chart for that trade. I can analyze better when I see the chart. Bernard

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Bernard, Attached are yesterdays results for Trend Catcher. Numbers aren't so 'rosy' but at least it did better than my manual trading did yesterday! By the way, when do you think the new version will be available for testing? Thanks for your work. Cheers! Benn

--- 帖子 #181 ---
i think 400 TP will get hit very rarely. Having TS 50 pips with 400 TP is like having 400 pips run without 50 pips retract, it's very rare nowadays unless there is news to push it. IMO, 250 TP is more easy to hit since 250 pips run without 50 pips retract is possible for low high/low pairs like EURUSD. TP 400 TS 50 might be good for high high/low pairs like GBPJPY

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi prosper4rex - As for this loss ...I did not want to so I came with complains. I know it's not holy grail, and I am able to accept such a loss. Only I wonder whether I have something wrong in the settings (which are, however, the standard) Compared with the results of example Mr Benn, I have only one open position during the day. Mayby too many pairs ? Maybe I have a small account? ?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi Gajowy, Just out of interest, I set up Bernards EA on my small demo account, which at the time, was about 690 bucks, so not a big account. I attached the EA to all of the pairs that were listed on the first page of this thread, something like 22 pairs or so. All settings were kept at default apart from GMT setting which is different for almost everybody. Then just left it alone. I appreciate the fact that it doesn't close weekend trades at the moment but I realise that this is being fixed. I have been overly impressed with the results, but, I am a realist and I know that losses will happen and do expect them. What I would like to do, is carry on trading manually and have Trend Catcher just running in the background on auto pilot grabbing a few pips here and there. I expect to continue this week with the EA on demo test and switch it to live trading quite soon. Cheers, Benn

--- 帖子 #184 ---
The EA seems to buy at top sell at bottom. Most of the trade. it tend to open sell at support and buy at resistance and the trade got bounds off the S&amp;R to negative pips. It's seems promising becoz if this continue, we just have to reverse all the trade given by the EA. However, if there is heavy trending market, i believe this EA will make money quite easily without having to reverse the trades. I think this EA would be even better if it's able to reverse the trade if found to be in range. Yesterday and today, all trade open so far didn't make money becoz it seems to be ranging. If all the trades was reverse for yesterday and today, it will make some good money. Maybe, the EA could include daily S&amp;R and only buy/sell if S&amp;R is broken.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
If we got DC or mt4 got close off, will the EA be able to handle the previously opened trade once back online again ?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
hi Bernard, thanks. I compared my settings with Belka and its the same. However, i could not reset the GST Offset to 0. Approached my broker (IBFX) and was told this must be done by the EA adviser (U). Pls help, thanks.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Prosper, I tend to agree with this message. The solution may be if you can tweak it to enter trade earlier than it does now(loosen the criteria just a little bit) and adjust TS to move forward 10 pips every 25-30 pips rather than 50 pips. What do you think? Yesterday night I had 4 trades out of which I got 1 pip profit on two and full loss on the other two. Think over it. It is just a suggestion. Moreover I'm glad that some user are getting more winning trades than losing ones. I am one of the other group. My trades do go into profit but ends in losses.Mostly it happens in JPY and EUR crosses which do not move as slow as main pairs. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #188 ---
These are ma results on 2 day of testing this EA ( During the test it runs on 6 pairs. EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, EUR/CHF) 25-03-09 - 5 trades closed - time for all trades GMT+2 http://clip2net.com/clip/m14275/1238...9-000-41kb.jpg 3 still running http://clip2net.com/clip/m14275/1238...9-003-27kb.jpg Trade A - we have to expect some trades to go against us- OK no problem Trade B - something went wrong - trade was above 50 pips and has not had Trailing Stop - my settings and that trade on screen below

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Benn, Last two days trading has been a little challenging. Thank you for posting your results. I'm doing a final testing on Friday, with Friday's conditions in place. If, all testing goes through smoothly, will upload it over weekend or next week. Bernard

--- 帖子 #190 ---
You can update the parameters to suit your trading style. Bernard

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Yes, it will be able to handle. Bernard

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I may have to adjust the TS. Will look deeper into that. Bernard

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Will look into that. Bernard

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Double click on GSTOffset field and you should be able to update. Bernard

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Gajowy, I have reviewed through my codes, but can't find anything wrong there. My trailing stop is performing normally on my own trades. This is what I think may have happend in your case. When it reaches +50 pips, EA kicked in the moving of stoploss function. It sends this request to your broker's server to update with new SL. Broker's server may be busy (it happens during news time mostly where there are usually heavy transactions at the server's end), and it sends back "server busy" signal. This will be recorded in the journal. The result is, server cannot process your signal, and no updating of SL took place. In the next tick, the EA checks through , but by now the +50 pips may have fallen below 50, thus no stoploss function will be activated by the EA. This fast drop of pips within a short time happens when there are major news event taking place. In the next version, I will adjust the SL to be tighter and raise entry level higher to avoid those ranging waves as far as it is possible. Bernard

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi Prosper4rex, Have traded 2 pairs with standard settings, gbpusd (with TP400, SL 100, TS 50)and eurusd (with TP100, SL 100, TS 50) not that these settings affected the overall results. Does take a while to "tune-in" to the trend, Eurusd opened short trade 25/3 @08h03 GMT (wrong time, as it happened) and closed with 100SL @13h56 Gbpusd opened 2 x trades - see attachment 1 - short 25/3 @ 09h00 GMT 1.4626, closed with TS 40pip profit at 1.4586 2 - short 25/3 @ 17h01 GMT 1.4540, closed 26/3 08h59 SL 100 at 1.4640. I think that in the absence of a logic change to correct the entry point, it would be safer to give the EA more breathing space, and change the SL to say 200pips, but this may lock in larger losses. Need to do extended testing with simulation tester to measure these alternatives. Best trading wishes to all......... Andy

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Appear to be having similar problem with SL or Broker. Any chance you can build in order insistence procedures, to prevent terminal refusals? See this thread to understand more what goes on...if you haven't already. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=70582 Attached is about 1 week demo IBFX

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Andy, Thanks for the upload. The EA needs some re-work to avoid a repeat of last two days unfavourable results. It works well in a trend as what happened last week. After a review through of the last two days performance results, a few things I will need to enhance. 1. SL to be tighter at 40pips instead of 50pips. Gets the open position quicker into safe territory with assurance of minimum 10 pips profit. 2. Entry level to be revised to avoid ranging markets. 3. No trading the first 2 hours during New York open, possibly London too. Major losses results from New York open, during news announcement. 4. Additional exit criteria - open positions have 1 hour to get SL going or else it will exit at the first opportunity with minimum profit. Bernard

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Ironbark, Your trading platform is fully dependant on broker's server. If, broker's server will not accept EA's request, there's pretty much no one can do anything about. There are two choices to trade - go manual or use an EA. If you use EA, you are tied down to the metatrader platform. Manual trading is hard work. I do understand what some brokers are up to. Thanks for your attached results. I will be adding a few touches in the EA to enhance performance based on the results. Bernard

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Prosper, The changes you suggest are very good but can you keep the option open for us to decide if we want to trade 2 hrs of NY open as well as London too? Vinesh

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Bernard, I've got the EA on the 6 major pairs that MT4 defaults to when you click on new chart. The results for the past 2 days have been disappointing. I have gone thru the trade history and the lossess have been greater than the wins, both in numbers and in pips. I have actually moved the SL to 40 in hopes of it locking in some profits earlier (item 1). I think your propose changes should help in making this EA reach profitability. Thanks for your hard work and sharing.

--- 帖子 #202 ---

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi Bernard, I am testing ver b and the EA just close all trades. It seems the Fri close of all open trades occurred a day early and 2 hrs late. I.ve attached the trade history printout.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Vinesh, Yes, the options will be available. I have also decided that the initial SL (once only) will be triggered when profits reached 30+ instead of +40. That way, it gets the trade to be in profit faster with profit locked in even quicker. Subsequent, SL will be remain at 40+. I have finished writing the codes, now going through for potential bugs. Will test it before uploading. Bernard

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Fxtrader, Thank you for trying the EA out. Must admit, its not perfect though, needs ongoing improvements. Thanks for the feedback. That's what it is, the bottom line is we make profits using the EA together. You are most welcome. Bernard

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Andy, You are welcome. Will upload once I tested it. Codes are re-written. Bernard

--- 帖子 #207 ---
fxtarder, Yes, I am aware of that bug. Thanks for the upload. Bernard

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I am not sure, but I think there is something wrong with the code. I suspect the SL sometimes is not moved even when it should. Just look at the attachment. Shouldn't be moved now to lock the profit? The price has got plenty of space, so I do not think the fault is on broker's side. What is your opinion, Prosper?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
It does not happen every time. I can see sometimes SL is moved, but sometimes not :/

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Bernard, Latest results for Trend Chaser. Not as good as last week but there you go. I still want to try out the latest version though when you have it ready. Cheers! Benn

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hello People, The new version of Forex Trend Catcher Ver. 1c, has been uploaded and can be found at start of thread , post #1. A review of past week performance results, shows that the previous version performs reasonably well in a trending market but faces challanges when market is ranging. A few things have been added to address this problem and enhance it's performance. 1. An initial SL (30) has been included to ensure that a trending position enters SL safety faster than before. Subsequent SL (40) applies. 2. Order entry has been revised to improve filtering of trending signals. 3. TradeNewYorkOpen and TradeLondonOpen are introduced to trade/not trade these markets when they open. Trading during market open, especially when New York opens, carries higher risk of losing trades than during normal hours with major news announcements. 4. Additional exit criteria introduced to manage orders created. Each order is given 15 mins to trigger SL, and locked in profits. If, it cannot, EA will attempt to close the position with minimal profit at first opportunity. Happy trading. Bernard

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Undercover, I have gone through my codes a few times. Personally, I am puzzled why this happened. I have tested it on a regular basis, but never encounter what you did. The SL works everytime. Can you upload the journal entry where all transactions are recorded? All abnormalities are recorded, and I can understand better when I review through the journal log. Bernard

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Benn, Thanks for the results again. The latest version Forex Trend Catcher Ver 1c, has been uploaded. Bernard

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Thanks for the new version Bernard, I look forward to testing it next week. Don't forget guys, GMT time will be moving forward by 1 hour as from Sunday 29th March because of the official start to British Summertime. Double check your GMT offset settings are correct! Good luck &amp; cheers, Benn.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Maybe I never got it right, but I have always been told GMT (UTC) never changes.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
You are correct Freddy. All time zones are determined relative to GMT or UTC and GMT/UTC never changes. I am in the Pacific Time Zone and that is always GMT -8. Since the use of daylight savings time is not universally implemented and where it is implemented, thanks to " de W", not at the same time it adds to the confusion. Mexico is normally 2 hrs ahead (with a few exception such as the Baja Penisula, think Cabo San Lucas, where it is 1 hr ahead) of me in Pacific time-zone. Since the beginning of March, it's only 1 hr ahead or the same. Where daylight savings is observed this week-end in Mexico it will be back to 2 hrs or 1 hr ahead. Likewise with London, it's normally 8 hours ahead of me, but has been 7 hours ahead since the beginning of March and will now go back to 8 when British Daylight goes into effect.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Prosper4rex, Will I need a new activation key # to trade this new version live, or can I still use the same key # as the last version? Again, I really appreciate your hard work and willingness to share, and am looking forward to live testing the EA improvements. Sincerley, SirViver.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
SirViver, You can you use the same key # as the last version. Bernard

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Like I said before I have tried many EA's and at first they make money then they lose... To try and get an EA to be able to make money in a trending market as well as a ranging market is not easy Bernard but I will give this one a try this week to see what happens... thanks for sharing... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #220 ---
soeasy69, You are most welcome. Bernard

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hello People, Please download the latest version, Forex Trend Catcher Ver. 1c from post #1, and not the outdated version 1a (at post #3). I tried removing post #3 (containing version 1a), but the "edit" button does not show, so I can't remove. Many people have been downloading the wrong version. Bernard

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi People, I encountered a bug with TradeLondonOpen. It escaped my testing last Friday. I just corrected it, please download the version 1c from post #1 again, if you have not done so. My apology for missing that bit of testing. Bernard

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Any trades today?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Here's my trading results so far. Version 1c's first day trading. Bernard

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Aha, I only wanted to trade the London session hence why I had no trades then. I have re-loaded the updated version so I will see how it goes and post my results as soon as I get them. Thanks for your hard work Bernard. Cheers, Benn ps. Nice results by the way!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
The results from the EA on 30 March, the day before, as posted above (post #224) was +200pips on a demo mini account. Yesterday (31 March), the market was generally choppy/ranging. The EA managed to pull in a profit of 30+ pips on same demo mini account. So far the changes made to the EA seems to achieve the desired results, i.e. generate profits in both trending and ranging/choppy markets. Bernard

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Benn, I look forward to your results. Thanks. Bernard

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi Benard! What settings are you using? Are you using the same as you posted previously for the most part? Default (besides broker offset)?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
bnbb2004, I used default settings, except for TradeLondonOpen and TradeNewYorkOpen. If any currency pair will be in news, I set to false, otherwise it will be true. Bernard

--- 帖子 #230 ---
So you always check the news the day before to turn on/off that feature?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
bnbb2004, Yes, precisely. I checked with the calender feature at the forum which lists the hour news will be coming out and set TradeLondonOpen and TradeNewYorkOpen accordingly. This will minimize risks in my trading. Bernard

Hi Bernard, Here's the results from yesterdays trading. I only traded the London session with all other settings at default (apart from gmt offset). I will trade both London &amp; US session today and see how it goes. Cheers, Benn

--- 帖子 #233 ---
How does it work, Dozen it have to stay in longer, I see that it takes 2,3,4 pips. Shouldn't it catch bigger trends like it says, why the small pips too.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Benn, Thanks for posting your results. Bernard

--- 帖子 #235 ---
tcmm, Trend signals received for the currency pairs does not turn out to be strong trends. In a strong trend, the currency pairs will be able to trigger TS within the 15 mins allowance and thereby locked in profit, otherwise EA attempts to close it with whatever profit it can get - even at 1 pip. To allow the open position to stay on, mildly trending/ranging as it is now, is risky as it may further develop into a losing trade. Please refer to post #211. Bernard

--- 帖子 #236 ---
hi.. bernard i have try use your EA and have a great results,will do live next week )..but there are problem on trigger the trade,i use interbank for demo and no problem with that but my other broker platform with i use for live didn't place a trade,is it because of GMTOffset is not correct? many thanks in advance..

--- 帖子 #237 ---
bexterlone, GMTOffset directly affects TradeLondonOpen and TradeNewYorkOpen. Yes, wrong GMTOffset does affect placing of trades. Bernard

--- 帖子 #238 ---
thanks..but i still confused,how can i set up to correct value,my platform time is 12

--- 帖子 #239 ---
bexterlone, You can refer to page 1, post #15 of the thread on how to set the correct GMTOffset. Bernard

--- 帖子 #240 ---
thanks,bernard are EA will be interrupt if i change to lower TF instead of 1H n above?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
bexterlone, The EA was designed for the 1HR and above TF. Best to stick with 1 HR TF. I always trade on 1 HR TF. Another thing to note, never switch to another TF when a trade is created for 1 HR TF. Always stick to the TF you are trading on. Bernard

--- 帖子 #242 ---
thank you so much for such a great advise bernard,will do that..stick on one TF..

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Prosper, I downloaded the new version from page 1. My compliments to you. It has traded a few times and taken medium and small profits in all trades, the operative word being "all'. Not a single loss. Profit is not great but it is better to have small profit than to have any kind of loss. Probably due to weak trend it takes whatever it can and closes the trades. I have traded London and NY openings too. I am not sure how this EA can be further improved but I am going to trade for a week further and see if I can come up with some suggestion. All the friends on this thread are requested to do the same (as this forum is intended for that reason only and Bernard is open to innovation as we have seen in the past). I myself am a newbie but I have tried several EAs to date but I find TC one of the better ones (better than most of the trash being sold in the open market). Thank you Bernard.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Bernard, I was going to send you a statement, but my broker ended the month before I could copy my statement. I started a new demo account with $3000 on Sunday night March 29th. It closed tonight the 31st with $3069.53. That was 15 positive trades in a row without any losses!! That is a 2.32% gain in two days! It was trading 10 pairs all with 5 pips or less spread. All trades were with the default settings. I have been trading manually over 4 years and never had 15 winning trades in a row with no losses. A big thanks is in order!! Russ

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Here's my statement for 1 single day. I trade only 8 pairs. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #246 ---
how do I attach it? I think it went to the attachment page. No its not there. Can someone help me out here?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I did pickup profits here and there, but I got one that hit -100 pips and the other small profits where whip out, or do you adjust something when this happens like this. Can you explain?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi Bernard. I have seen so many matters on the threads that I was about to consider myself being stuck to manual trading, as most EAs are either too complicated to set or just don't do their job at all. I agree with you about getting away from the screens more........12+ hrs is easily achieved here, especially when it is hot outside and inside the AC is cooling. Will load it after I finish this post and demo trade for a few days. Will also email you for a key, as I am VERY MUCH interested in this way of trading forex. GRACIAS for a job well done so far, keep up the good work and I will do my best to get you my results here.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Vinesh, Thank you for your kind compliments. This EA is never static, will always be improved upon to address any deficiencies encountered. Yes, I do need suggestions and feedbacks to carry out the improvement/enhancement process. Bernard

--- 帖子 #250 ---

tcmm, The first two days testing on version 1c have shown reasonably good results under different market conditions. The third day testing, I too encountered the -100 pips loss on GBPCHF. I am analyzing why that entry was taken and with that loss. Improvements will be needed on this current version to address this loss. I am looking into it. Bernard

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Freddyfx, Great to see you here. Look forward to your results and feedbacks. Bernard

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I tried it but didnt work for me. I'll try again.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Lets see if it uploads. Nope. 8 straight profitable trades. I cannot upload it for some reason.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Vinesh. Struggling here with the same problems, have the STATEMENT, but cannot get it accepted in the FF post. ANYWAY: EA loaded, 9 pairs 5 trades profitable 1 BE 2 open Decided to make a screenshot of the HISTORY and attach it this way. Hope it is readible.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Having already nice results and that merely in 3 hrs after installation. Trading the following pairs: EURUSD, AUDUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, EURJPY, USDJPY, USDCHF, EURGBP, GBPJPY 7 all good 3 open at the moment

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Vinesh and Freddyfx, This may help you in uploading the results file. 1. Save in metatrader as html file, *.htm. 2. Open the .htm file under Word and save it as word document, *.doc. This should be able to solve the uploading problem. Bernard

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Do you think the stoploss maybe can be lower. I wonder on a 30 pip stop since it takes small profits. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
bernard are the EA is running if my acc. details are not appear on my chart?the details are appear on demo but not in my live acc.. many thanks in advance..

--- 帖子 #261 ---
tcmm, This EA is meant to capture "big" profits in a trending market. Unfortunately, not all days are trending. Once EA is triggered and it finds itself facing a mildly trending/ranging currency pair, it has to take whatever profits it can get - even very small profits, and get out of the situation as fast as possible. This EA is designed to cater for trending markets, and it has to make profit in a non-trending market too. I am reviewing the results. Vinesh has proposed me a workable idea to address the problem. Yes, I am looking into making the initial TS smaller. Bernard

--- 帖子 #262 ---
bexterlone, Live accounts require activation key. This will not be issued out at the moment, until the EA (version 1c) has been robustly tested first. Bernard

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks Do you keep the London and New York on true, all day or explain. And What Main Currencies are good to trade . Thanks

--- 帖子 #264 ---
tcmm, Please refer to post #229 and #231. USD and YEN will be good to trade. Bernard

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Well Well in fact I have been News Trading For Years, thats no problem for me. Keep a watch on in the London Time for News ie: GBP, EUR, it happens mostly at 4.30am est.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
really..need an activation key,okay thanks 4 da info bernard,when it ready just let us know ,and thanks again for make this EA very great..2 thumbs up 4 you

--- 帖子 #267 ---
tcmm, I avoid news. I find it too risky trading news. Bernard

Because of trading times

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Prosper, I thank you for your dedication and hard work with this EA. I've used it for two days with great results (in the area of 19% - see attached). I will continue to monitor the progress through next week before going live. I am puzzled with the timeframe comments. I was not aware the TF impacts the trades. If there are no settings in the EA for TF, how does TF affect the trade. Otherwise, I am very encouraged with your product and its results.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
fxshadow, Your setting for TradeNewYorkOpen is set to false for the currency pairs appearing in the messages. As such, there is no trading done at this hours. Without the messages, you will be clueless as to why it is not trading. The messages are not retained permanently by your platform, and does not occupy additional space in your PC. Bernard

--- 帖子 #274 ---
MrRolf, Thank you for posting your results. You have quite impressive results. The next version 1d, is under testing. Enhancements are made to improve on the deficiencies found in version 1c. Version 1d will be uploaded once it is ready and cleared my testing. The EA tracks each transaction created by means of a Magic Number. This magic number is partially derived from the TF you are trading on. If you are trading on 1 HR TF, a transaction record will be created with the Magic Number partially derived from the 1 HR TF. At this time, if you decided to switch to trading on 4HR TF, new transaction records created will have it's Magic Number derived from the 4HR TF. A Magic Number created on 1 HR is totally diffrent from one created in a 4HR TF. The EA will not recognise that record created on 1 HR TF, if you are now trading on a 4HR TF. For this reason, always stick to the TF you are trading on. It is not advisable to switch TFs in the midst of trading. Bernard

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thanks for the answer Bernard.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Just to get my understanding right: what will be the difference when I let the EA run an another TF next week then H1 as I have it set now?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi Bernard, how do I get a registration # to try this on a small live account? Thanks

--- 帖子 #278 ---
He explained that a few posts ago, brother.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Freddyfx, You can run the EA on any TF of your choosing. No problem here. However, if a transaction has already been created on one TF and has not closed out yet, do not switch to another TF. It will cause problem to the EA in tracking the transaction from the previous TF. Bernard

--- 帖子 #280 ---
fuzzle, No key activation# will be given out at the moment. Until, the EA has been thoroughly tested and produced the desired results, then it will be issued for live account. Bernard

--- 帖子 #281 ---
This is one pair I have not tried to trade yet. Somehow skipped my notice.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Bernard, I found it out today!!!!!!Lost more than $1000.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Here's my best effort. Please IGNORE EUR/USD resuts and calculate. Those were my manual trades in which as I said I lost, so my fault. the results are awesome. Started with $5606.Total loss showing -$437. Capital now $5569. So TC earned about $470 without a single losing trade.% wise it comes to 9% in 2 days. Give me a better deal and I'll show you a PONZI scheme. Actually when I saw Detailed result b4 my foolish manual trade I did not believe the graph! It went at 45 degrees in a straight line.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
bernard the default for tradenewyorkopen=false and tradelondonpen=false,are it mean the EA will not trade during NY and London session?or the EA will trade on the Asian session only many thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Vinesh, Thanks for posting your results here. It would be better if you can post it as a word document file. Text file is hard to read. Bernard

--- 帖子 #286 ---
bexterlone, If TradeLondonOpen=false, no trading done on that currency pair from 07:00 - 10:00 GMT. Similarly, for TradeNewYorkOpen=false - no trading between 12:00 - 15:00 GMT. All other hours, the EA will trade. Do note, EA will stop opening new positions each Friday, 15:00 GMT. This is to allow sufficient time for existing open positions to close in profit before forex market closes for the weekend. You can set TradeLondonOpen / TradeNewYorkOpen to true, if you desire to trade when either markets open for trading. Bernard

--- 帖子 #287 ---
sorry my english is not good,didnt know wat is slippage on early,it mean the EA will not place a trade until 3hours after NY and London session to avoid news right? thanks agains 4 da info bernard

--- 帖子 #288 ---
bexterlone, No, that's not what slippage means. You place an order to buy/sell EURUSD at a certain price. Your broker fills your order at a worst price. That's slippage. Bernard

--- 帖子 #289 ---
hello! thought I'd try this out at broco investor4 demo, my live broker for now until ATC or mbt is up and going. will use h1 at first next week. then maybe h4 the week after. will try .1 lots then increase every 1000.00 made on a 3000.00 account. hope it works out!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
hazelj80, You can demo trade with this EA but no live trading yet until it is tested further. Anyway, activation key is required for live trades. This will not be given out at the moment. Bernard

--- 帖子 #291 ---
oh yes, that's what i meant! no live trades yet! i read everything i will test for now. hopefully in may it will be a good/better one to have in the collection!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Bernard. I guess you did not understand my question, but NP. I was merely asking what the effect would be to have the EA trade on another TF. As I have no knowledge of how the programming is done and the entries are decided. So far this week it runs on H1. Will it take different trades if I let it run on another TF? I pushed it thru NFP, no damage done. Still having a USDCHF Short open since yesterday 16.44 Have a GREAT weekend, hope to see the new version popup here.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I have the same short still open.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
We might get lucky on it exiting with some profit, but now a SELL EU has been added and normally those two work opposite, so lets see. To others that are PM-ing me, I am not the developer of this EA, just testing seriously as all others. no EA is the Holy Grail, and it needs time to see what it can do, so be PATIENT. I am normally trading , that is manually, and for the ones that want to know, using Pip Range Bars Charting. Contact me if you want to test that. At the moment open: USDCHF S @ 1.1315 EURUSD S @ 1.3408

--- 帖子 #295 ---
EA closed all, that is the last EU trade in loss, as the Swissy trade made it to the final just in time for profit. Wishing all a relaxed weekend.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Freddyfx, Yes, it will take different trades on another TF. Version 1d is still under testing. Give it a couple of more days, and I will upload it here. You have a great weekend too. Bernard

--- 帖子 #297 ---
i'm still confused on this GMTOffset of a thing - prosper4rex, now i just have metatrader4 trade station with demo account. according to you this GMTOffset should be that of the broker. i havent signed up yet with a broker, so what will be the appropriate value here? the confusing thing is that the Market watch (as you mentioned earlier) is showing local time - not GMT. so to convert it rightly i will need to know the country which thier server is. then do the country/GMT conversion right? so how do i determine this correctly? or will the default 3 value ok?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
zymone44, You cannot get the broker's correct time on a weekend when the forex market is closed, as there is no trading and the broker's clock is not active (it is not moving at all). Try it when the forex market opens for trading, and so do your broker. It does not matter whether your account is on demo or live, the GMTOffset must still be correctly set. Go to www.greenwichmeantime.com and check what is GMT currently. Compare this time with your broker's time at Market Watch. Your broker's time is usually a few hours ahead of GMT. The difference in time is the GMTOffset. If your broker's time is the same as your local time, your broker must be in the same timezone as you are. Bernard

--- 帖子 #299 ---
prosper4rex, i'm using metatrader4 demo. in default installation what will be the right GMTOffset. refering me to www.greenwichmeantime.com further confuses me, 'cos i will need to know the country of the server in other to do the right conversion there. presently i'm in Japan and the time displayed in the metatrader4 is not my local time either. is the time displayed in the metatrader4 a GMT format or local time format?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
zymone, It doesn't matter where you are, all that matters is what time is showing on your MT4 platform compared to GMT. When your MT4 platform starts up again and the clock starts to tick, simply log onto http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ and see how far apart the times are. I'm in Hong Kong and if, for example, my MT4 states 9:41am and GMT time states 11:41am, then the GMT setting will be +2. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
zymone44, You do not need to know where your broker's server is located. You do not have to do any conversion at all. All these are handled by the EA. All that is required from you is to let the EA know how many hours your broker's server time is ahead/behind GMT. To do this, go to www.greenwichmeantime.com to know what is the current GMT time. Compare it with your broker's server time at Market Watch in your demo platform. This is usually a few hours ahead of GMT. The difference in time is the GMTOffset. Example, GMT time from www.greenwichmeantime.com is now 02:00. Your broker's server time is 05:00. You can view it under Market Watch. Broker's server time is then 3 hrs ahead of GMT. The GMTOffset is 3. Update this value (3) in your GMTOffset parameter within Properties of your chart. Bernard

There's been no trades as of late last night. Anyone the same?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I got 2 sells of eurgpb, but both stopped at $0.30 profit...it looks as if it could have gotten more profit...but then it reversed, so good thing stopped for cents in profits, as it would be in the red about 30 pips now. (initally posted that maybe stops being moved to early, but edited post after seeing that price went against the trade) I just started just yesterday, many trades for cents in profit, one trade for about 8 pips, and no trade for losses.

Auch. Around 9 GMT 3 trades that went sour on me, the rest all little profits. So far the losses are far much bigger then the gains. Account down $262.99 from a start with $3K Just letting it run as is, by the way, since Sunday opening have it on a M5 setup. As the newest version cannot be far away, not uploading any statements now. If Bernard wants them, he knows how to get hold of me.

Bexterlane, There's a slight kink in v.1c which Bernard is fixing as we speak. v.1d is on its way. Wait it out.We have all noted this kink.So far I've not had a single losing trade but the profit has been 1 or 2 pips only. Have patience. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Does the new version address the 1 or 2 pips profit only, or is that necessary to avoid losses while waiting to catch a nice small retrace ride?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Freddyfx, I don't know about running the EA on M5. It was designed to run on 1 HR and above. I never try it on other TF except 1 HR. Yes, version 1d is on the way. Now under constant testing. You can e-mail me or post the results here. I need all the results of testing I can get. This helps me tremendously in fine tuning the EA. Bernard

--- 帖子 #314 ---
bexterlone, You may want to refer to post #211. Point 4 of that post answers the 1 pip profit issue. Additional info at #261. Bernard

--- 帖子 #315 ---
bexterlone, Thanks for posting your results. I will review through. Bernard

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Vinesh, Version 1d is under testing now. Bernard

--- 帖子 #318 ---
[quote=wwwin;2654694]Does the new version address the 1 or 2 pips profit only, or is that necessary to avoid losses while waiting to catch a nice small retrace ride?[/ wwwin, v1b was doing fine (just like any other EA but it made losses too). This version doesnt make big losses but takes limited profit. The next version will address both issues. If EA catches strong trend it'll make big profits but medium and weak trends can ruin an account. Bernard is trying to optimise as much as possible. I hope this answers your query. Vinesh p.s. your suggestions are welcome too friend.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
[quote=vinesh;2654905] Yeah, that's what I thought, a lot of very small gains is much better than a big loss...I guess under the current version, in order to have a 100 loss, then the price must go against you from the getgo and not look back....hey, if this can limit losses and occasionally catch a nice ride then it's good

--- 帖子 #320 ---
"Each order is given 15 mins to trigger SL, and locked in profits. If, it cannot, EA will attempt to close the position with minimal profit at first opportunity." Got it, so its a time trigger...interesting, so after 15 minutes, it closes as soon as not in the red. Maybe the actual time could be an changeable input rather than static so that we can experiment with different times. Maybe not, that would make the thread go all over the place, with too many inputs.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Still running this EA in its present version. Lots of small profits, it are the few missers that eliminate the overall profit so far. From a $3K start at the moment at $2679.13 Awaiting the latest version.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Yes, same here the many small profits do not cover the less frequent larger losses....Bottom line, you have to take some risks if you want to make mucho $$...very difficult to pinpoint the absolute most favorable entry point...just my humble opinion.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hello People, Version 1d has been uploaded to the beginning of thread, post #1. 1. Timer now has been extended from 15 mins to 1 hr. 2. Initial trailing stop is now set to Minimum Stop Loss Allowed (imposed by broker) + spread. 3. Entry is initiated when a strong trend is in place. Do provide me your ideas, suggestions, feedback, etc for future improvements to the EA. EA has to keep pace with a changing forex market and evolve over time. This requires new ideas and suggestions. Your feedback of results is important to gauge the strength and weaknesses thrown up by the EA. With the results, I am able to optimise the set of internal parameters within the EA to maximise it's efficiency. No EA can remain static over time and expected to produce consistent results. Market condition changes and so must the EA adapt to those changes. Bernard

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Version 1d-01 has been updated to replace version 1d. There is a bug in version 1d. This has been rectified in version 1d-01. Bernard

--- 帖子 #328 ---
OK, loaded on a brand new demo account, so I don't get confused with the results. The old one is going to be trashed. Starting again with a $3K, as I am testing on 9 pairs as mentioned in earlier posts.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
What is the GMT setting for FXDD and Forex.com ?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Why do you want to stop trading for NY and London time? Why does this EA not work well during those times?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I noticed there is no magic number. Can I trade more than one pair at a time? if so how does it work?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Bernard Would the "Bug" have accounted for the losses that started to accumulate, similiar to 1c? If not I wonder if a extra filter is required, such as Fractals? I notice a couple of the trades that went wrong were executed at or close to, a swing high or low.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
There is a parameter not optimised fully. It is allowing non-compliant trades to seep through. I am now testing out which "ideal" value to set for that parameter. I will need a little more time. Bernard

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Activation key will be issued out later when EA has been tested to satisfaction. Bernard

This message comes about because you are using Trend Catcher on a live account. Live account requires activation key to use. No activation key will be issued at the moment until TC is fully tested and trading successfully. You should be using it on demo at the present moment. Bernard

--- 帖子 #337 ---
hi Bernard,, could you post daily result of 1d version every day ????? it helps newbie or everyone to follow the thread isn't it????? cheers,

--- 帖子 #338 ---
to trade multiple pairs dont you need a magic number?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi Bernard, I love the idea behind Trend Catcher and believe it has good potential, if we can stop the large draw downs. Take a look at the attached pdf. Note that the large loss of $206.51 was during the London opening. I knew 10 to 15 minutes after the trade started, it was going in the wrong direction and everything within me said close the trade, however, I chose to leave it open and see what happened. Now I know, next time close the trade or don’t trade during the London opening. Same with the $113.86 loss, I chose to leave it open when I should have closed it. If I had closed both bad trades, it would have been a very good profitable time. Bernard, keep up the good work. Peter

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thanks a lot Vinesh

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Nice results. I am also letting it trade thru all market openings, as otherwise Bernard cannot get any feedback on what is really happening. As it is demo anyhow, no real losses so far if a bad trade comes in between. Let's see what the coming week will produce.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
does anyone saw any trade that goes with a profit of more than 100 pips ? I saw some hitting the SL -100 pips but i never see any going more than 100 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
The main idea behind an EA is that you do not have to stick to your monitor and that the software should take on trades at correct times to avoid big drawdowns. Of course all drawdowns cannot be eliminated and sometimes a trade may go in a loss. look at your results. 2 big losses but how many winning trades? Now consider how to maximise the winnings on the 'winners'. Hence this forum to throw ideas in the 'pool' so that we can come up with something useful to that end. In your account ratio of winners to losers is phenomenal. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Yes I have seen full profit on a two trades.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Mine has not initiated a single trade since market open Sunday night. Will need to find out why. The old version was taking trades, so I must have something small wrong. The older version also made me 2 max profit, so seems we all are close on the same results.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
hi Mr freddy do you have any result since last night???????

--- 帖子 #347 ---
NO, not a single trade since last night.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I just uploaded the latest version, version 1e. This version include the following changes, 1. Timer extended to 2 hours. 2. Additional filters to screen out trend signals. 3. Spread Limit set to 5 (default). The result for today's demo is attached. Demo was done on a mini account, not the usual standard account. 200+ pips in profit.

Freddyfx, New version 1e has been uploaded. Bernard

GREAT !!! It started to become quiet with no trades popping up in this crazy market today. Will load immediately, THANKS !!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I know for this discussion forum it is not, but from my experience this is a scalper EA, I get VERY small trades. It takes profits with 10 and 20 pips almost every time.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
tnx Bernard i 'm very optimistic about this EA

$aly, Thank you for your support. Bernard

Hi Bernard and others I´m knew to this promosing thread. Have a question about Trading opening times. If I set it = false, I understand that it not take any knew trades under that time, but what about open trades. Does EA close them ore let them run? Regards Elovv

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Elovv. For existing open trades, the EA will let them run. Bernard

Hi all, Loaded 1e last night at 10.30p.m. pacific and went to sleep. Today morning saw 5 trades totalling +47 pips. I have put it on only 5 majors. EUR, GBP, USD/JPY, AUS and EUR/GBP. The a/c has only $500 as a start. So in toto about +9% profit. Not a single losing trade yet. I still am not able to post my result on this forum. This is for information only. All trades stopped out in + territory. Vinesh p.s. all settings default except GMT offset and with MM on.

Maybee Should Make Smaller Take Profit So It Will Hit More Offten The take Proffit Then The Trailling Stop Just Qouestion

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Joe, You can make TP smaller manually by adjusting the level, but I wouldnt want to miss out on a big move in Trending market. Right now it is Ranging. There is nothing you cannot change in this EA except Source Code. All parameters are changeable to your comfort level. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #361 ---
why?!!!!! it can be helpful

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Because I dont know how!!

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Yesterday was a difficult ranging market, a true test for a trend based EA. Version 1e of Trend Catcher still managed to pull in 17 pips. Please note, demo is done on a mini account. Bernard

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Have been running this EA for the week and I have it on 4 charts EURGDP EURCHF EURCAD EURAUD and AUDJPY. The only chart it has traded on has been AUDJPY as it has been in a consistant downtrend. Even though it has caught the downtrent good (made 1 wrong bad guess which went for a big loss) it only seems to pull a 1-5pip profit. This might have to do with the size of the range with it going to around 50-55pips. the pullin back and hitting the trailing stop. I am going to try lowering the TP to 50 and see what happens. This will put my risk at twice my reward but with the success rate it has had on this pair I will see how it goes. Have you had any trades on any of the other pairs I mentioned?? I am running this demo on f0r3x.com (remove 0 and 3 because I don't believe i have enought posts to put in brokers) and these are the only major pairs it has access to. I am also going to stick it on a mbt account to get access to more pairs and see how it fares. So far this seems promising.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
mmeador, You may want to download the latest version, Trend Catcher Ver 1e. The last two days results have been posted. You may want to look at them. The new version seeks to overcome the problems faced by previous versions. Bernard

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Got it.... currently running on 2 demos forex.com and alpari. Will post back tomorrow evening when I am back to this PC to check results. Appreciate all the work bernard and others! I hope I can be of some help from here forward with this EA.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Are you guys leaving the London and New york to true on the EA, all the time?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I am. And it catches more trades for me.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
How many Currencies do you trade on this System?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi, I am new to this thread, where can i get the latest EA?. Also can it set to semi EA i.e only produce alert when enter and exit and not take trades. Thanks

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I trade 10 pairs. Use IBFX demo. Start trading yesterday 14/4 13.46 GMT Many small wins, one loose usd/cad profit so fare $41,63. But only sells, not one buy. I don´t know if something is wrong. Does anybody have buys? Regards Elovv

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I managed to get version 1e. But when I tried to do the strategy test, mt4 crash down. Any one can say how to back test this.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
i took them too approximately....but results grow up since 1d and it's better now....let's wait and see what happen

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi fxmad, the EA was compiled with the new version of meta4, so anything less than build 220 cannot run the EA. Go get at least build 220 and you'll be fine. kos

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi Vinesh, GMT offset set to 0 right? MM means money management?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi Bernard, Thanks for all your efforts with the EA. I have reviewed your trading data for April 15 and IMHO note a discrepancy with the stop loss on two of the trades. As follows and assuming a default stop loss of 100 :- Closed, Entry Price, S/L, S/L Comments Trade #8653314 Sell EUR/GBP 0.8903 0.9003 OK Trade #8655894 Sell EUR/USD 1.3265 1.3259 Should be 1.3365 Trade #8676144 Sell EUR/CHF 1.5117 1.5107 Should be 1.5217 The stop loss on the last two trades is taking out the trades prematurely and prevents them from developing. I noticed the same situation on my demo trades with ver 1e. Some pairs were not allowed to run due to the stop loss being on the wrong side of the entry price, hence the low profit. The Buy position trades appear to have the problem as well. Sell positions on some pairs like the first trade above have the s/l correctly placed, but for me the EA then gets into trouble by entering a Sell position at the pivot point at the bottom of a down trend. The trend then reverses and eventually hits the stop loss. This wipes out all the small profit gains the EA made. If you could stop the EA from doing this you would have it made. Refer April 14 16:02 Sell USD/CAD Entered at 1.2072 S/L 1.2172 (OK) T/P 1.1672 and stopped out at 1.2172. Thanks again, Iolite http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Elovv, There's nothing wrong. The trades I have are all sell too. Bernard

--- 帖子 #378 ---
southamp, Yes, MM = Money Management. Bernard

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Thanks Bernard. Just to confirm that there isnt any trade for the last 2 hours?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Iolite, Thanks for your feedback. There is no discrepancy with the stop loss. Every newly created entry has a SL of -100 pips. When price reached 2 X (Minimum SL allowed by broker + spread), initial TS kicks in. For EURUSD, it is 2 X (3 + 3) = 12 pips. Once, price equals or exceeds 12 pips above/below open price, TS kicks in and move SL from -100 to to (3 + 3) = 6 pips above/below open price. This happens once only. Subsequent TS is activated every 40 pips above/below last SL. Similar explanation for EURCHF. Bernard

--- 帖子 #381 ---
southamp, No trades for last 2 hours. Bernard

--- 帖子 #382 ---
thanks Bernard. Have a profitable trading day.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Thanks Bernard there have been some buy orders today so EA works. But the result is not so god so far. Account history is -$125.17 and open trades -$52.17.

Hi, I have been following this thread for a week or so now and have tried to get the ea working but for some reason it is greyed out in my ea folder, i have tried to get it working but every time i do it crashes mt, i am on alpari with build 223, i have the same problem on my notebook and my pc any ideas would be appretiated. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Mine is greyed to so that is not the problem. Have You the ver1e? Tried on other brooker? I have used it on FXDD, ODL and IBFX build 223. Maybe take home a fresh new Alpari? Elovv

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi, The EA is showing grey bcos the source code is not open.223 works fine for me. Try another demo a/c, maybe there was some problem during downloding it. Vinesh p.s. I've not tried it myself but Alpari is reportedly good broker.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Version 1e results (mini account) from 13 April (Monday) till 15 April (Wednesday). So far, 190+ pips in profit. The feedback received so far , 1. The Initial 2 X(Min SL + Spread) to trigger Initial TS is too small. Needs to be widened. This is causing it to take very small profit when it could have taken more. Proposed to 3 X or 4 X. 2. Some requested Timer to be removed. Timer is there for a purpose, to minimise a losing position. I think it should stay but may need to be extended to a longer period. Let's hear feedback from the rest of you + recommendations. Bernard

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Does it need indicators on the chart to work? Mine has not taken a trade in more than 3 days and I have it demoed on 6 pairs? - 4 hr, 150sl 300 profit. Not trading during London or Ny time.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
alpine4133, Try on 1HR TF. It is most effective on 1HR TF. Bernard

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Ok, switching to 1hr. I thought I read that this was designed for 4hr or higher. I will see how this does. thanks

--- 帖子 #393 ---
hi Bernard I hink you are correct about the timer staying but it may be prudent to extend it a bit more, How much I am usure? I have been following this thread since you started it and I think we all owe you a vote of thanks for sharing the EA with us. Rob

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Kiwikid, Thanks for your feedback. From analyzing the results so far, I think the ideal time should be 3-4 hours after trade open. You are most welcome. Bernard

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi Bernard, Thank you for your explanation of the trailing stop method of execution. The problem for me was that I had never seen the trailing stop working on any of the charts for the twelve pairs being traded. Will look more closely now. Would you please advise if you are running with the ver 1e default spread limit of 5. I assume the EA will not trade with a spread &gt; 5. I find a fairly large nuber of pairs may start out with a spread of 5 but during the course of the trade will vary from 5 to 7 thru 9. I am using IBFX as the demo Broker. Accordingly I am switching back to 10 which was the default setting on ver1c. Is there a reason you changed from 10 to 5 on ver 1e ? The USA/CAD chart uploaded by Elovv is the same position I referred to in my post #376. All of Elovv's charts show a pivot point sell entry at the bottom of a downtrend. This is a real killer to the system. As a suggestion to prevent the EA from entering a sell order at a pivot point after a series of lower lows, would it be feasable to hold the EA from initiating the order until the current candle times out. Then confirm the next candle at open or a few minutes after open does not have a higher low. If true, initiate the trade. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #396 ---
The EA works but still lose. One more big loose $100 audusd so now from 04.14 13:46 till 04.16 08:15 Account history -$202 trades -$93 so EA have lost more than $300 in less than 48 hour. 2 problem I guess. It take some trades in the end of a trend witch result in big losses. And the small profits. Regards Elovv

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Version 1e last night also gave me a huge loss ($500) on the Aussie on my FXDD demo. I've have UseMoneyManagement set to true on a $5000 demo account. Statement attached. Joe

--- 帖子 #398 ---
..

--- 帖子 #399 ---
If it give this loss consistently we just have to reverse all trade.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Geoff, Yes, my default spread limit is 5. The reason for using 5 instead of original 10 has to do with the 2 X (min SL allowed by broker + Spread) condition when it is reached and triggers off TS. If min SL allowed by broker is 3 and spread is 5, 2 X (3 + 5) = 16 pips. If same min SL and spread is 10, then 2 X (3 + 10) = 26 pips. 16 pips is easier to reach than 26 pips. That's the primary reason for switching from 10 to 5 spread limit. Elovv has uploaded his charts showing the short coming of the present system. This is what I need to build a stronger EA. Currently, the EA does not take into account pivot levels. As Elovv's results has shown, this needs to be seriously considered in future versions. I am considering your suggestion on the lower lows before initiating entry. Bernard

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Elovv, Pivot points will be included as entry criteria in next version. Thank you for your feedback. Bernard

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Joe, The flaw in the EA has been noted. Thanks for posting your result. Bernard

--- 帖子 #403 ---
If you have nothing positive to contribute to this thread, refrain from posting your sarcastic remarks. This is not the first time you are doing it. Bernard

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Bernard You do a fantastic work with the EA development! I think with time it will be very succesfull if you still analysis the result from the thread members. Thank You, its a pleasure to follow this thread. Elovv

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Prosper, You are doing an excellent job developing your EA. Everyone seems to be fond of it and assisting by providing feedback. Please stay encouraged and not let some dampen your spirit. I can agree with the results of most users since using version E. Taking pivot points into consideration for your EA may help in entry points - just a thought. The entry points seem to be an area needing improvements. We thank you for your continued efforts. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
hi Bernard i have a question ... there are a little different between my results and other's result that have been posted in thread .... what is the reason?????? saly regards;

--- 帖子 #407 ---
On the 1 hr charts I still have only 1 trade all day.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I'm sorry that I didn't explain myself well and you misunderstood. I'm not trying to make sarcastic remarks. I'm trying to give the point that if there is a rule in the EA that can define ranging market,the EA will reverse all trade signal when ranging market = true.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Bernarnd below is a SS of my most recent activity. Currently I have it on EURUSD GBPUSD EURCHF &amp; EURGDP. And so far it has traded on on GBPUSD and has a trade open on EURGDP that ran away from it but it appears will come back and will end up closign for the small profit again (Like John madden Says: "Some Profit is better then None Profit" ) As you can see by my chart it got in the trend and took 2 small wins for 10pips each but then it took a large loss of 100pips that it opened at the peak of the trend that led to the SL . Noticed you said you were going to work on tweaking so it dosen't do this so I hope the SS can help. Note I am running stock settings only setting GMT offset to match my broker.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Elovv, Thank you. Improvements on the current version is in progress. It is feedback from users like yourself that make enhancements and improvements of the EA possible. Bernard

--- 帖子 #411 ---
MrRolf, Thank you for your encouragement. A valuable piece of feedback is that Pivot Points must be an important consideration for EA to initiate entry. Presently, the EA does not consider Pivot Levels. Enhancements are now being made to correct this situation along with additional suggestions provided by individuals. Bernard

--- 帖子 #412 ---
saly, Different users use different currency pairs to test out the EA. Some used very limited range while others use all currency pairs provided by brokers. This will produce differing results. Bernard

--- 帖子 #413 ---
alpine4133, I understand from one of your previous posts that you use something like 5 currency pairs to test out the EA. You may want to include more pairs. Anyway, there are very few trades yesterday. Bernard

--- 帖子 #414 ---
mmeador, Thanks for the chart upload. Many have feedback to me on this similar problem. It is taking trades close to end of trend. Pivot Points and other suggestions are now being programmed in the next version to counter this recurring problem. Bernard

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi all From 04.14 13:46 until now 04.17 13:00 Account history is positive, + $2 But open trades are -$175 One big win usdchf $135 So I think this can be grate thanks Bernard. Elovv

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi EA Stop trade at 15.00 GMT but did not close all 20.00 GMT. I have GMToffset=0 because IBFX=GMT time. But I think IBFX stop trade 20.00 Maybe I can set GMToffset=-1? Than EA stop trade and close 1 ouhr earlier? Elovv

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Elovv, The next version will be better. Suggestions received have been coded into the next version (version 1f). Just finished my coding and going through for possible bugs. I will be testing out on demo next week. Bernard

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Elovv, I was not aware that IBFX stopped trading at 20:00 GMT, Friday. I will have to change the EndWeekCloseAll to 19:30 instead of 20:00 then. Have a good weekend. Bernard

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi everyone I am new to this thread and have been follwing with great interest. As I am now a believer in EA's. let me try to share with everyone here what I think of them and this Trend Catcher EA Firstly, EAs are not supposed to be the holy grail in FX trading. If FTC ( Forex Trend Catcher ) can even do 10% a month.. it would be fantastic. EAs are supposed to help us make the decisions on entering and saving us all the headache on deciding and then having the discipline to trade our calls and SLs. We all want a life when we are making money too. Secondly, in forex trading.. wealth is created one step ( oen pip ) at a time and then the compounding takes over. Thirdly, from what I have been reading, the EA can already be considered good. Some times.. too much fine tuning can just lead to nowhere. We must always remember that the markets are dynamic. All we have to do is learn to set the parameters around the market. As the saying goes.. "why fix something that aint broken". Fourth, not all pairs will work in the same setups. Remember, the volatility of different pairs will effect the trades. We cannot have a 40 pip SL on a pair like USD/GBP as it will be hit in no time on a swing. If you use your ATR, you can set your SL accordingly. Good exmaples will be the GU and EU pairs ( may be same setup ) and the UC and UJ pairs. Fifth , trend catching always incurs bigger losses.. As targets are bigger and SL will have to be fair to stop from getting slapped by the market. If we keep worrying about taking small losses and wanting to take the small profits and running.. then it wont be a trend catcher anymore.. it will be more like any other scalping software out there. I think the original FTC concept was right. Just needed fine tuning to it. This way.. taking 400 pips and losing 100 is a fair price to pay. What we need now to really know how this EA is doing is to have results matched with settings on which platforms. As we all know, every platform effects the trades. Some platforms do play around with accounts with EA's. Can I suggest that everyone use www.mt4stats.com and show us settings / platform. This way, we will know in real time ( 5 mins delay ) on the respective setups and pairs. If we organize ourselves, our learning curve will be much faster and our feedback can be given to Bernard to improve and we can all get a good EA running to make life easier for us all. This way, we can always compare our results by just keeping the links and referring to the setups. It will be a win win situation for all. I will post mine on Monday.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
I tend in part to agree with this statement. But here we're trying out to smooth out kinks which are giving big losses against small gains.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hey Vinesh Yes.. I agree with you that it would be good to work out the kinks. I am all for it too. But we must also understand the fact that this market is dynamic. We may be able to do well one week and the next.. we may be stuck.. I have every reason to believe that the system as it is as good as can be. Tweaking it will definately be better. The problem is.. there will be no end of tweaking. If we can use the system as it is and still make the pips.. lets use it as it is now and research on for the future. Lets stick on for the FTC to be a trend trading EA and not convert it to a scalping EA. http://ftc001.mt4stats.com/ Its a link for us to follow. Platform FXDD; Settings : default

--- 帖子 #422 ---
prosper, Even though I have still been getting small gains, 42 in a row, I just got a SL of $146 which is more than the 100 default setting. It wiped out all the gains! This loss was on E/G. Just for your information.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
E/G pip value is higher than any other pair. So either you must have lost 100 pips only, or maybe your platform closed down and when you reopened it was already in bigger loss which got triggered on opening. Vinesh p.s. 42 winners in a row! Thats something indeed. I have had 16 in a row but like you 1 loss was more than enough to cover all the profit. Bernard is working on this problem. p.p.s. Considering so many winners in a row, has anyone got a suggestion how to improve profits? If so Bernard is open to suggestions.And this thread is for that purpose only.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
You Could Set Your Take Profit To 50 Pips So You Would Gain A Lot More Then The 400 Pip Profit Because If You End Up With Small Gain This Means Market Wass Allready By 50 Pips Gain So Just take It I Dont Think You Are Going To Have to Many Gains Of 400 Pips So better To Have 50 Of Every Trade Then 10 Or 20 Of 90% Of Trades And 5% Losses And 5% From 50 To 400 Pips

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hi People, I have received many feedback to improve version 1e. I have tried to include some of these in the new version 1f. The changes made include the following, 1. Taking trend direction from higher TFs. 2. Pivot points consideration. 3. Candles lower low or higher high. 4. CCI to confirm trend. However, the new EA is not making any trades. It does seem that all these criteria in addition to the existing ones, is making the entry very tight. Just too tight that no trades can be initiated. However, Dave has e-mailed me and referred me to a indicator which he has been using with success on his manual trades. I have created an EA using this indicator filtered with existing conditions in version 1e. The results has been very encouraging. I will be doing some more test to fine tune this EA before releasing it as version 1f. Bernard

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi Bernard I Am Trying this Ea Now For 3 Days and I am Now Up With Over 500 Pips Only 1 Lose I Think I am Going To Change stop loss To 50 Because All The Winning trades I Hade Didnt Draw Down To 50 Pips Watt Do You Think About thate Thanks For Your Work

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Joes, The default SL -100 is just a guideline. You can change to -50 if you think it suits your trading. Each currency pair has its own characteristic, some require more than 100 while others less. We all can share our results and optimised settings to trade the different currency pairs for maximum profit. Bernard

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi, Bernard. It seems to me, that SL can not be changed on 5 digits platforms. May be it is a mistake in code. Please check.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Sounds good. Have you tried the strategy. I f you have please post the results.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Is this with 50 pip TP? If so its simply fantastic!!

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I Only tried With Standard Settings But If I Would Take Profit At 50 Pips I Would Be Up 750 Pips , Now About Changing the Stop Loss To 50 Pips I Dont Now Yet I Will Find Out Today If Draw Down That Got Down To More Than 50 pips Will End Up Hitting Stop Loss I might Change It to 50 Or 60 But If It Will Come Back To Profit I Will Leave It At 100 Pips Now Abbout Posting The Results I Dont Now How

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Now I Just Hade One Hitting Stop Loss So I Think I Will Move Stop Loss

31 trades $31.19 profit used TP 50, SL 100, TS 40, SL Incr 10, NY and London Open=True The f version should be better. Keep up the good work, guys Andy

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I adjusted to the above settings also, as the earlier ones did not give me the results I had hoped for. Now let's see what happens with those few losers in between that damage the revenues.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
After reviewing through several indicators including what Dave has referred me to, I have decided to write my own indicator. The greatest problem I faced with this EA is that, some time it gets triggered off when the market is ranging and not trending. It is to this end that I decided to create an indicator able to tell me when a market is trending and especially when it is ranging. The EA will then be able to avoid a ranging market where it faces the most risks. I will be using this indicator with version 1f. Usage, 1. When Blue Line is above Red Line = Trending 2. When Red Line is above Blue Line = Ranging

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi, Bernard 1. I think, the current version (1e) can make pips on both ranging and trending markets. 2. All indicators are lagging, so we will see ranging or trading only post factum. 3. What is not good in current version. EA opens a trade near S/R, got some pips (trade is closed by trailing stop) and opens a new trade. This trades I close manually. 4. Nevertheless the results are positive. Regards, SNL

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Version 1f has been uploaded on post #1. Make sure that you download TrendRange_bars indicator too. Bernard

--- 帖子 #438 ---
snl, Thanks for your feedback. Version 1f has just been uploaded and will be an improvement over version 1e. Bernard

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Andy, Thank you for uploading your results. Version 1f has been uploaded. Bernard

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Tranell, EA has to be tweaked once in a while. It can never be stagnant because it has to change with a changing market. Your mt4stats is a great idea to show results online. Version 1f has been uploaded and timer increased to maximise profit on a trending position. Bernard

--- 帖子 #441 ---
snl, I tried on a 5 digit platform. It can be changed. Bernard

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Great news, will IMMEDIATELY load the new version and the indicator. Looking forward to a nice result.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I thought you would want these set to false and if set to false it would not trade during the NY or London Open. Since when these markets open the prices jump. I thought this might be a 1 hour window for each of them. Now from the notes below if it is false it will not trade before NY or London opens but will trade after they open. Can some one explain this better to me. Why would I want it false and why might I want it true. 5. TradeNewYorkOpen option to trade/not trade before New York opens for trading. 6. TradeLondonOpen option to trade/not trade before London opens for trading.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
1. What is "ProfitCutOffTime"? What are the choices and what does this do? 2. I know what trailing stop is and you have a trailingstop amount option, but what is "InitialStopFactor"?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
alpine4133, You have the option to set TradeNewYorkOpen/TradeLondonOpen to true/false. This is a personal preference, as some do not like to trade when NewYork/London open, while others do. If TradeNewYorkOpen is set to false, no new position will be open from 12:00 - 15:00 GMT. If TradeLondonOpen is set to false, no new position will be open from 07:00 - 10:00 GMT. During these periods, news will be a announced which will create wild swings and high volatility. Setting to false will bypass this wild swing periods and not expose your trading to unnecessary risks. Bernard

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi Bernard Must we put TrendRange_bars indicator on every chart? Elovv

--- 帖子 #447 ---
alpine4133, Each open positions will have a set number of hours to trigger initial Trailing Stop, otherwise EA will close it with minimum profit at the first opportunity. The set number of hours is ProfitCutOffTime. Now you have the option to set it to 0 (no ProfitCutOffTime) or 1 or more. In version 1e, the first time when EA triggers off Trailing Stop is when it reached 2 (InitialStopFactor) X (Minimum SL allowed by broker + spread). Now, you have the option to change it to 3 or more. Subsequent Trailing Stop after this will be 40 pips or more. Bernard

Elovv, It is not necessary to put TrendRange_bars on every chart. Bernard

--- 帖子 #449 ---
But do we have to attach it to charts? Or just deposit it in indicators file?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Vinesh, No, you do not have to attach to charts. Just deposit it in the indicators folder. The EA will interact with the indicator on it's own. Bernard

--- 帖子 #451 ---
hi Bernard can i ask you what's the difference between this version and the previews version?????? i think non of your versions never consider pivots and daily levels.... do you want to apply this on your EA.....

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi Bernard Version 1f seems to work fine. Not so many trade. I like to buy/sell because the market is trending. But maybe the stop loss is ti big for 1H graafs. We buy/sell in a trend. Wouldn´t we sell when the trend is broken? Maybe we can use SMA. Or the high/low of the previus bar. My little thinking Regards Elovv

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi Elovv could you post your result since yesterday???? my result not changed too much.. tnx

Different brookers give different result with EA. Of them I have tested I think IBFX works great. Elovv

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi Bernard, used demo a/c $10k, lot size 0.10. Settings mainly default with the following: TP:50, SL:100, SL inc:10, TS:40, Initial SF:3, Profit Cut-off:3 (if using 0 instead of 3, results are lousy!) 1st pass, where 'true' for London /NY opening: trades=25, Net Profit=-$84, Profit trades=88%. Had small profit trades, some big losses. 2nd pass, where 'false' for London /NY opening: trades=20, Net Profit=+$99, Profit trades=95%. Had small profit trades, one big loss - see attached schedule. The large number of small profits (1 x pip to 5 pips) are still a problem, entry point logic needs extra attention? perhaps allow price freedom to move up/down early in the trade? Also, the very big SL of 100 pips kills the small trades - I used smaller SL:50 in one test, results were worse! Best wishes.............. Andy

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi Andy! The newest version is much better. Download it and I think you will have different result. Elovv

If You look to Bernards .doc for his trade 24/4 You see hi use http://www.fxopen.com/ I use IBFX I think the best You can do is to test many brookers. Regards Elovv

Very good I have nearly thesame from IBFX ($167). Is this from demo or live? I did a search in the brooker thread about Fxopen on Forexfactory....many says scam about them. Interesting to compare different brookers. I have test ODL,FXDD,IBFX So fare IBFX is the better with this EA. Elovv

Hello All, Great thread, Can someone tell me what is the correct version of this EA...Also, can anyone who is trading micro accounts with this ea post their settings that they use...I am trading only 0.01 lots..just would like to see your setting if your trading that small of lots..Again thanks for any help Jimmy B

The version is f. No other version is at present attached to any mail. You can check out the previous page for various results. And GL. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi Elovv.....quite right, I did a back test over 6 weeks, using the eurusd pair only. Bernard in his test of 24/4, tested multi pairs, where eurusd had 2 trades of 22p and 1pip =23pips. It was the eurgbp which gave him the major profit trades of 9p and 74p = 83pips. I believe it is better to focus on one pair at a time, and iron out the problems, then move on to the next. However, at the end of it all, one may just find that the system is already perfectly set-up for the eurgbp!! That would be cool! I will run a back test on that pair as well. Trading rules, OK! Andy

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hi I don´t know if we can trust backtest? Today (18.02GMT) 8 closed trade, profit $26. 1 open trade eurgbp +$60 Elovv

--- 帖子 #470 ---
how many pairs do you use???? could you write their name ??? saly

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hi....... In the back test, firstly of 24/4 only on eurgbp, I got 1 trade, 73 pip profit; vs 2 x trades by Bernard of 9p + 74p - differences can be expected.?? In the back test of "eurgbp" for the comparison against eurusd, done previously as in the thread shown above, 1 Mar to 18 Apr..................... Trades =23, Net Profit=-37.44, Profit trades 78.26%, largest profit $73.13, largest loss $-146.59. See attachment for test results - parameters, chart, detail report etc. Cheers to our trading. Andy

--- 帖子 #475 ---
alpine4133, You will get some small profit along the way until Trend Catcher is able to "catch" a big trend. Bernard

--- 帖子 #476 ---
AndyM-pips, I have never backtested Trend Catcher. From my understanding, backtesting has never been accurate. Many EAs when backtested produced superior results, but when forward tested failed miserably. Bernard

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Berard, What are your settings in the Trend Catcher EA. Thanks

--- 帖子 #478 ---
tcmm, I used default settings. Bernard

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Alpine 4133 I also experienced small pip wins until yesterday 4/27, when the EA rode a small trend on EUR/GBP for a gain of 37 pips. (Same trade as shown in Bernards attachment). I actually saw the trailing stop loss in action. The EA was good in this trade as it made an exit right at the start of a ranging period. I might add I have had zero loss ( about a dozen trades )over the last two days of the demo trial. Further no pivot point entries have been seen. Currently one trade from twelve pairs is running with minimal draw down. Early days yet, but never the less, impressive programming. Geoff

--- 帖子 #480 ---
My IBFX result 27/4 +$77 You have a little better result on FXopen for 24+27/4. But do you trudt them? If You do a search on FXopen on Forexfactory you have many scam + scum words? Have You traded live with them? Elovv

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Elovv, Trading results (demo) on 24/4 is from fxopen, but results (demo) on 27/4 is from fxlite. Different brokers. No, I have no live account with fxopen. Bernard

--- 帖子 #482 ---
So far so good, I'm 9 for 9 with small gains (1 was for $15) on IBFX demo. Good Job, Benard! :-)

--- 帖子 #483 ---
bnbb2004, Thank you. When this EA has been tested and stable and profitable, we can all make some easy money. Bernard

--- 帖子 #484 ---
it looks like getting hit on 400 TP is very rare. Maybe the TP can be set to nearest S&amp;R that is more than 100 pips away from the entry. What do u think Benard ?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
forexisfx, I agree 400 TP is rare, but it does happen. You can changed TP to 150-200, as long as it is more than SL, to maintain a profitable ratio. Bernard

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Bernard, thnx for the new version. It look pretty impressive. My guess is the EA will be good for live after 1 or 2 more version. Hope I can spot some flaw in this version and contribute to make it better.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Bernard... Quite right, in some respects back-testing will give different results. MT admits that their test data can be incomplete, or slightly different compared to what is processed through individual brokers. My results are very similiar to your results e.g. your test of 24/4, I back-tested that same day, where you had 74p for eurgbp, I had 73p, you had a further 9pip trade, which I did not have. You have small pip trades, just like I have. What is very stunning about the back-testing, is to perform volume tests over and over on the same data (an apples-to-apples comparison). My testing on the data of 1 Mar to 18 Apr on eurusd - in 2 hours I performed 12 simulation pass-throughs on the data. These revealed that bypassing London /NY open produced more profit (+99p vs -84p), that a smaller SL of 50 gave a higher loss, that some changed settings on InitialSF and ProfitCut-off gave terrible losses. I did not even try and test the other combinations of EA settings. Once all likely combinations have been tested, and the EA tuned for maximum performance, then the "proof" of the eating can be completed. My tuppenny worth.......... Best wishes and keep-up the great work all of you Andy

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Prosper, If you had a custom indicator that can get attached to a currency pair, would it help you at all in determining entry/exit points? If it will be helpful, I can provide you with the custom pivot point indicator. I would guess that you can code some lines from this indicator into your EA. Please let me know. MrRolf

--- 帖子 #489 ---
TC Version 1f - Results for 28 April 2009. Loss = $56. Bernard

--- 帖子 #490 ---
forexisfx, I hope to make the EA achieve consistent profit and go live as soon as possible. Unfortunately, from today's result it is still not ready yet for live trading. I welcome your contribution. Bernard

--- 帖子 #491 ---
MrRolf, This version was supposed to have pivot points including others, but I decided to do without it at the last moment. There were too many conditions squeezed into the codes and make entry too tight for any trades to take place. Instead, I re-tool it with my indicator TrendRange_bars. Looks like Pivots is needed after all. Bernard

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Here are my trades. Demo account on gain capital .

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Maybe have a "use pivot" true/false selection. We can test it out to see which one is better running both true and false with different account.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Bernard Attached hereto are my EA results for the last couple of days. Note :- Only one loss, 4/28 time 10:03 with the CAD/USD pair. Blew a serious dent in the previous profit with that trade. It occured at a swing high pivot point......a BUY order that went promptly into a downtrend and took out the S/L. Note also the USD/CAD SELL order 4/29 time 7:40. The trailing stop caused the exit an hour ago (my current time) with the trend still going south with the loss of further potential profit. I used the default trailing S/L and this may be just too tight, as it did'nt allow the regular price movement to occur during the current candle 1HR time period and so gave a premature exit in this case. It is always difficult to know what to use. In manual trading I usually use a trailing S/L of (ATR * x) where x depends on the pair being traded and varies between 0.4 to 2.0. For this pair I would probably use 1.33. Bernard, if you could successfully address the Pivot Point entry problem you would be there. Attached File(s) DetailedStatement.doc 109 KB | 260 downloads Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Bernard , sometimes the EA seems to reenter right after the position is close. Usually , that reentered position will end up having negative in less than an hour due to buying at the top after the position is close. I think the EA can add a condition to reenter after position is close for at least 1 H [1 candle].

--- 帖子 #499 ---
We have 2 successive loss after 2 successive wins for version 1f . Version 1f needs further improvement to increase it's winning ratio. Version 1g will include pivot points, hidden stop loss to prevent stop loss hunting and a delay timer (1 hr) to check that new open positions will only open after it has been previously closed for at least 1 hour. Bernard

--- 帖子 #500 ---
forexisfx, Thank you. The current version 1f is still not up to the mark. I have 2 days of loss in a row after 2 days of winnings. Verison 1g is in progress and hopefully this will be the version we can all go live and make money in forex. Bernard

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Thank you for the results. Version 1f is still registering a loss. Bernard

--- 帖子 #502 ---
forexisfx, I think Pivots are a necessity to prevent the last 2 days of losses. Bernard

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Iolite, Pivot Points will be used in the next version 1g. For ATR, do you use daily or hourly? How do you determine x? Bernard

Joes, 15 pips is just too tight for a trailing stop. Bernard

--- 帖子 #514 ---
For manual day trading I use a trailing stop based on the ATR, 20 period for the 1 Hour chart. The "x factor" is purely a subjective number based on the personal feel I have for the pair being traded. I simply look on the 1 HR chart for the last two or three days and determine if the candle ranges are fairly consistent in length. If they are then I will use the ATR value for the day and add a small safety percentage (ie x= 1.2). If not then I will adjust the x value accordingly, up or down with the aim of staying in the trend but with a minimal stop loss value. After a short while you will get "the knowledge or gut feel" for the pair and will be able to apply a reasonable trailing stop. It is variable and the stop value can change during the weeks trading, but it beats a fixed trailing stop loss value. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Much beter than I have on IBFX! I have 3 big losses and +$10. What brooker do you use? Elovv

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I think the EA avoided some trade becoz of spread. The demo is on Gain capital .

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Surprising! On Gain Capitals I ge losses more often. My a/c made about 30% profit in 3 days and then I went into loss of about the same %.So my losses outweighs the gains and my capital has been reduced. Vinesh p.s. This is just fyi. Maybe it is because I Demo trade on fixed spread platform where majority of pairs have small spreads so the EA takes on more trades.

Ironbark, your results are great on a $500 account. I did not manage such a good result on my $5000 account, 12 pairs. See attached. Can you post your settings please so I can compare. Also can you tell us what pairs you are using? I think that if you had results like mine you would have had a margin call. So I do not know about a $500 account? May be some of the experienced traders can shed some light on this??? Also many thanks to prosper4rex for all your efforts in developing this EA and sharing it with the community !!! PipBear

TC Version 1g is ready. I am no longer uploading it to the thread. This version will be available to those who have made contributions to it's development, whether with suggestions, ideas, inputs or helping to test it out and posting results. Please check your e-mails / messages I left in your comment box. Bernard

--- 帖子 #533 ---
These are the additions made to version 1g. 1. EA will no longer take trades near to Pivot Level/Support/Resistance. 2. Initial SL is hidden from broker to prevent broker from Stop Loss hunting. 3. Time difference bewteen newly open trades and when it was last closed, is set to 1 hour. InitialStopBuffer = Min SL + Spread + 20(default). When price equals/exceeds InitialStopBuffer, Trailing Stop is activated. PivotBuffer = Spread + 0(default). Surrounds each Pivot Level/Support/Resistance. When price falls within these zones, no entry will be created. Bernard

I Hade Good Profits Beginning Of last Week But End Wipped Out All Profits I Think Because Of Placing Orders Right After Closing Order And Entering To late To Market Also I Would Like To Now If It Is Safe To Use This On GBP-Yen Even It have Bigger Spread Because Looks Like It have Good Oppertunities With This Pair Now For Showing My Results I Tryed Watt You Told Me But Couldent Open File How Do I Save It On Docament File I Am Not A Computer Man Thanks For Your Work And I Also Think I Have Good Idea For Closing Out Trades When It Is In Good Proffit It Should Look In 4 Hour Chart And Wait Till It Pulls Back For Long Position To Previos Low Candel Or For Short Position PullS Back To Higher Than Previos Candel Good Luck To All Joseph

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Joes, Version 1g has corrected the problem of "Placing Orders Right After Closing Order". Now it requires a newly open order to check that the last closed order for the currency pair was at least an hour ago. GBY-Yen is highly volatile pair. It's spread is usually around 8 pips for most brokers. Current default settings of 5 allows only spreads with maximum 5 pips, and thereby this excludes GBY-Yen from trading. If you wish to trade GBY-Yen , you will have to widen default spread to 8. Can you contact me through e-mail for version 1g? Bernard

--- 帖子 #541 ---
if u wanna trade volatile pair , u might have to increase ur SL. i think SL 100 work quite well for pairs like EURUSD. For GBPJPY , i dont think it will work well. u might get hit more often. if u trade a few currency pairs, better to choose those which have almost the same volatility. High volatility pair will wipe out gain on low volatility pair.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Bernard, Thanks for 1g, I’ve just placed it on my demo account. I’ve had my demo off for a week, my broker was using it to test his new ECN live feed. I’ll attach my results later in the week. Thanks Peter

Hi PipBear Settings are default except GMT Pairs I'm using are GC,AU,EG,EU,UJ,GU,UC,EC,UC,EJ,CJ I was lucky and didn't get a couple of your bad trades, because my pair choice was slightly different. Testing 1g this week, so should see improvement.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi Bernard, I have been following this thread for the last few days and running the EA on a demo account. The EA looks promising but as many other experienced lots of small wins are wiped out by rare big losses. You might want to add to the EA something that I'm doing on my manual trading which is closing part of the position to secure profit or cut losses but the rest of the position stays to catch longer trends or in hope for a reversal on a losing trade. This of course should be optional with parameters to set the pratial SL / TP. I guess this feature is not easy to implement because the regular SL and TP are reached only once and the partial points can be crossed several times in one trade and should be activated only once. Thanks a lot for all your work on this EA so far. Oren

prosper4rex I have just downloaded V1f and installed it on ForexTrader platform. I tested it using various pairs EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD but when come to EURGBP pair NO trade was made. I ran it 3 more time and observe it carefully. It still made NO trade. I set it to default. Have I something wrong somewhere. See attached.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
thebedal, I do not do back test for Trend Catcher EA. In my forward test, there were a number of transactions for EURGBP. Some of them highly profitable. I do not think you did anything wrong. It is just that back testing an EA is never a good way to evaluate an EA, because it is not accurate. Bernard

--- 帖子 #569 ---
In future, to prevent confusion, let us all mention the version of the Trend Catcher we are posting results from. Right now, some are posting results from version 1f and others version 1g. Bernard

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I have no trade on either demo a/c. I am running it on 2 a/c. Vinesh I'll try with higher risk %.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
prosper4rex thanks for the reply. You are right there's nothing wrong with my test. I did back test again this evening and looks OK. In my earlier test I notice that the spread was too big (8) while in the parameter is 5. FYI, I have already started on forward test, one trade is executed. Regards. TheBedal.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
With 1g I had the sell with EURUSD. Looks like it performed well. Dean

--- 帖子 #573 ---
not a good morining for version 1f(last week was decent). Would it be possible to obtain 1g?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi Bernard Is This version 1g Good For Live Or Only for Demo

--- 帖子 #575 ---
How come I am not getting a single trade yet? Anybody using Forex.com MQL ? Vinesh

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Can you tell me the time and result. I'm in US too. Curious to know what I am doing wrong. I've tried all previous versions and got trades. This is the only exception. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Only Demo yet. For live you'll need licence from Bernard. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Some problem here, not a single trade so far.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I am using Forex.com also. Using all defaults with 1g version. Although Bernard says you don't have to attach the 2 indicators to the charts, I did. It was this morning around 7 am central time Dean

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Well Freddy it doesnt seem to like Pacific time for some reason. I'm in Ca. and you're in Mexico. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Ty Dean. If it doesnt trade today also we'll try it with indicators attached. Vinesh

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi Dean, What are the 2 indicators named that you have loaded. I only have TrendRange_bars loaded on 1 of my charts to see what it is like (red &amp; blue line indicator). Hi Bernard, Has not been a good day for the 1f on the EURUSD, SL from a buy then a little 6pip sell at the bottom of the dip. Since ea appears to only run 1 trade at a time, maybe it depends when the ea is loaded, as to how it starts picking trades. Seems to be doing a long pause now, so may get into the right sequence. I will see tonight(your tomorrow). cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi Bernard. Am back-testing, period for 6 weeks, but no trades are executed. Used defaults, then changed parameters to alternative settings, but still no trades are entered. Regards Andy

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hi Andy, I saw on your backtest reports that you get 90% Modelling quality. Thats really pretty dang good, especially compared to my normal 25% &amp; 50% at best (once only). Any chance of you putting together a noddy guide as an attachment to how you get your data loaded &amp; selected, source etc. I have demos on IBFX mini &amp; FXDD std, but with the MT4 platform seems to still head to meta-quotes for getting history data. Should I run it from/next to my live IBFX mini acct. Still like to forward test tho. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Overall, the market is ranging yesterday (Monday). This is a Trend Catcher EA, it is supposed to catch trends and stay out of a ranging market. Except for a small trend on EURUSD it caught, it is doing its best to stay out from a ranging market. If you wish to see more trades, adjust PivotBuffer to 0 or less than the default (5). These are no-go zones for the EA, Spread + PivotBuffer, surrounding each pivot level, support levels and resistance levels. You cannot expect Trend Catcher to trade during a non-trending ranging day, right? Expect some days to have no trades at all. Bernard

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Joes, Version 1g is good for both live and demo. Bernard

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hello Prosper4ex I am new to forex and have been following your thread with great interest. Would like to try your system live..I have sent you an email requesting the latest version as well as the details you requested to activate in live session. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi scalpz, check the attachment, I hope it helps. I do not know all the functionality but let me know if you need a helping hand. The back testing works V well indeed, yesterday I did 25 x 1 months tests on another EA for a friend of mine, now he can get stuck into his final forward testing happy in the knowledge that he has honed his settings down to the correct ones and eliminated most of the bugs. No one can waste 25 months of real world time. Rather use the tester! Cheers Andy

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hi, Anyone back-testing Ver.1g make new trades. I've tried on EURUSD and USDJPY unfortunately get no trades. I'm also doing forward testing. Regards, TheBedals.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Zero trade so far for this week.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Ditto with me.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hi, No trades during back testing - I have tried period 11/2/2008 till 16/3/2008 which is continous Long - nothing traded. Also tested period 4/8/2008 to 10/9/2008 which is continous Short market, no trades entered. I think there is something disabled in the EA, or alternatively I'm doing something v wrong with the strategy tester....looking for the cause, cannot find at present, will test further. Forward testing - no trades entered as at this moment. regards Andy

--- 帖子 #593 ---
The EA works. I have had 2 trades yesterday, IBFX. Elovv

--- 帖子 #594 ---
and what about results?????

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Version 1f of Trend Catcher makes a few trades, everyone knows. The major difference between version 1g and version 1f, is that version 1g will not take any trades near to Pivot/Support/Resistance levels. This has always being the main gripe with version 1f and versions before it. Trades taken near to these levels in most cases result in SL being triggered, and wiping out majority of the winning trades. Now, you have what you require in an EA. Version 1g is working, it has been tested before being released. It takes fewer trades and avoids a ranging market. This EA is supposed to work in trending markets, hence it's name. It will try to avoid making trades in a ranging market. So, I do not understand why you expect to see trades everyday, even in a non-trending market like today or yesterday. Bernard

--- 帖子 #596 ---
One 100 pips lose, one 5 pips win. Elovv

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hi all... I just d/load the G version..will test it and post a result later .. thanks again bernard

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi Bernard, The back testing I'm trying to do for you, specifically address trending markets, refer my earlier post..... 11/2/2008 to 16/3/2008 EurUsd trends UP non-stop, the best period in which to test the true potential of this EA, and 04/8/2008 to 10/9/2008 EurUsd trends DOWN non-stop, the best time to test this capability of the EA. This EA is not opening trades during these periods, I'm trying to find-out why. Regards Andy

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hi Bernard, Thanks for the v1g. Have now got it all loaded on 8 charts. Noticed when I loaded GBPJPY, it didnt show the text labels for Pivot S1 S2 etc. I eventually extended the SpreadLimit to 9 &amp; they show. Thought strange, cause EURGBP has a spread of 9 also but the Pivot text labels have been showing since the ea was loaded. So increased EURGBP SpreadLimit from 5 to 6 &amp; they didnt reshow. Got up to 9 before they reappeared (after 5-10sec 'thinking' pause). Maybe when I 1st applied the ea to EURGBP the spread was very low. Is this only checked in the init function, or repeatedly rechecked and something else was maybe stalling things. When the ea is checking for location of the pivots, is it looking in the direction of the selected buy or sell for enough clearance for TP or just InitialStopBuffer. Or is it checking both directions before deciding sell or buy. Thanks again for the v1g, still in the waiting mode - I'm not good at that. I better not come back as a buzzard. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Right now working off of the hour trend bars I have only 3 possible pairs ready to work while the rest are either ranging or high spreads . Dean

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Now I have 6 pairs in the trending area and so I put the f version in just to see what would happen. Well I got orders but they all went into losses immediately and not just barely, they went fast. Down 150.00 usd. So version g is protecting you for sure. Sure Bernard may still need to tweak it a bit but I'd rather keep then lose money. Dean update: 2 hrs later 4 of the 6 pairs have gone into profit. D/D got to around 225 at the worst.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hi Dean, On v1g, I have now got a sell on EURUSD. Got loaded 6th 05:02 GMT? @1.3247 Unfortunately currently showing -25 pips. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi Andy, you are awesome. Took me quite a few goes, but I finally got a backtest with 90% qual. Thankyou so much for your help. There is nothing missing from your doc. If I had read the pop up screens properly, may have had success earlier. Hope I can repeat it on other backtests later. Ver 1g EURUSD sell slipped to -50 pips. cheers

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Does anybody know whether the broker can read the comment area because either my timing is lousy when turning on f version or the broker saw the orders and did right the opposite because at the precise moment I did the orders they went fast. 3 got out in small profit after 3 hrs but the others are way away from profit. Bernard maybe that should be something we can change or turn off. Dean

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi scalpz Your short entry puts it right on the Pivot S1 line on my system (shows at 1.3246) - what is the S1 line value on your system at time of entry? No entry made on my system. Regards Andy

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi Bernard, Thank god it was a demo. Have a look at the attached file. Peter

--- 帖子 #607 ---
this week zero trade so far. I'm using 1g

--- 帖子 #608 ---
no trades here either- got 12 pairs running. im thinking that is good thing- being careful.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
My apologies to those who do not see any trades taking place. With so many people stating that they do not have a single trade, I re-checked my codes. There is a bug in the EA which I have overlook. The EA refers to the history log file where all closed trades are logged, to check that a currency pair that is to be open has a trade closed at least an hour ago, if it has previously traded. However, I forgot to consider that newly open demo platform has no history files at all. This is affecting the processing logic of the EA. Please wait a while until I have corrected the error. In the mean time, those who are now running version 1g, e-mail me again so that I can respond with the amended copy later on. Bernard

--- 帖子 #610 ---
So if we did a small trade and closed it then an hour later it would trade for that pair, correct? I will give that a try anyway. Might be an easy fix that way. Dean

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Dean, Trades open manually and trades open by EA are two different separate trades. The EA will only recognise trades open by itself and close it later. Bernard

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi Bernard, What plans do you have in place to comply with the new NFA hedging rules, which comes into effect on May 15? IBFX have issued a notice that after May 8 they will not allow hedging on open orders within a currency pair.. cheers, Andy

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Andy, At any one time, no two open orders take place for the same currency pair but only one order. The ruling has no impact on the EA. Bernard

--- 帖子 #614 ---
hi bernard.. just have one question,if i've change pivotbuffer,is there any chance the EA will take a trade,if so which no. u prefer me to change it.. thanks bernard

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi Andy, Sorry I missed giving a reply earlier on the Pivot S1. Got far too busy yesterday, took me away from FF - have to stop that. Currently (7thMay) my S1 is showing as 1.3261 with Pivot at 1.3317, but yesterday when the sell was taken S1 was 1.3262 and Pivot was 1.3349. Cant see why there should be that much diff to your 1.3246 S1. Oh - unless its brokers, mine is on standard account FXDD demo which is GMT+3. If I recall right, yours is IBFX demo GMT+0. Maybe we should add our brokers to version in our headings when needed - like v1g on FXDD demo. cheers scalpz

In one of my previous message , I stated that there is a bug preventing trades from opening in version 1g. I have corrected it and am testing it on a new demo platform. If all goes well, I will send the amended copy (named as version 1h) to your e-mail. I have many e-mails and may overlook. So, for those who are testing version 1g, e-mail me to be put on the sending list. Bernard

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hi, I've been following this thread quite closely. I have Ver 1f installed as of now, and dont seem to be getting too many trades. Waiting for the fixed Ver 1g. Thanks for updating the thread and the EA constantly.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hi Bernard, How are you progressing with the latest version? Can we help you test it? Regards Andy

--- 帖子 #620 ---
So far, I have received 3 e-mails stating that version 1h crashed while loading. Anyone else facing the same problem? The EA seems to be working smoothly on my PC though. Bernard

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Mine crash. I have send u email.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
hi bernard.. thanks again for h version bernard,as i email u just now,i got crashed on my platform,but then i try to run it on another broker,still got crashed,is anyone using h version have the same problem

--- 帖子 #623 ---
The problem of version 1h crashing when loaded seems to stem from loading it on Windows XP. The present version 1h is compiled with Windows Vista as the OS. The compiled version may not be compatible for those PC running on XP. I'll have to compiled on a PC using Window's XP. Give me some time to borrow a PC using XP and re-compile the source code. This should be able to solve the problem. Bernard

--- 帖子 #624 ---
yup bernard im using XP on my PC..dont be rush ..,hope diz will solve da problem to whom using XP...thanks bernard cheers

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Why it doesn't happen to previous version ? U compiled all previous version with which OS ?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Yes, same problem, the XP O/S must be the cause. Regards Andy

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Bernard, I don't think the problem is with the O/S. I installed it in both XP and Vista platform, and both crashed. Maybe there is some files missing in our computer?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
It is working fine on my notebook (using Vista) and my friend's PC (windows XP). This is a indeed strange. Anyway, I will be e-mailing the re-compiled copy. So, please check your e-mail. Bernard

--- 帖子 #629 ---
got it bernard..it works,no crased..thanks

--- 帖子 #630 ---
It's working now.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Bernard Thanks for Your work and the new ver 1h. I noticed some change in settings. Ver 1h have InitilStopBuffer=15, PivotBuffer=15. Ver 1g had 10 for both values. Just wonder what the values do and why You change them. Elovv

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Elovv, InitialStopBuffer=15, PivotBuffer=10. There is no particular reason. We have to work out the ideal values used for the parameters as we go along testing the EA. Currently, it is based on gut feel, and any values that seems just right is put in. Bernard

--- 帖子 #633 ---
any result from 1h??????? not a single trade yet

--- 帖子 #635 ---
I had 4 trades about 4 hrs ago that all were profitable, each one took about an hr to complete. I then downloaded the third version of h and it crashed. So back to first version of h and while reattaching them I got 3 more trades started, all were jpy types on all 7 trades. So you might remove the ea and then reattach. I have all 22 possible pairs with the ea attached. The last 3 trades that I am watching went negative immediately so you might reattach them later. Dean

--- 帖子 #636 ---
No crashes here, everything seems to be going along just fine.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
If I take profit early or stop the EA in a losing trade, will it affect the way the EA trades in the future?. Does the EA need to complete a trade from start to finish, or can I interfere without any problems?.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Ended up with 8 trades, all profitable for the day. 1st version h with default settings. Dean

Which broker are you using friend? Vinesh

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Prosper4rex! I just discovered your EA this evening and beeing reading through all posts. Awsome jobe! I've being trading for some time and with your aproval i will test also your EA in the current version f. Hopefully later on i will try it on one of the micro acconts i have, but for the moment will do it demo. Thanks again for all you hard work and for giving away you EA My best wishes Tim

--- 帖子 #641 ---
jcf, Yes, you can interfere manually (close trades) with EA triggered trades. But, let the EA open trades. Do not manually open trades. Bernard

--- 帖子 #642 ---
$aly, Yes, there were results. I have 4-5 trades open on newly setup demo platform. Bernard

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Forex.com Down to 16 pairs from 22, the other 6 pairs have had spreads way to high for the time being.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
timf1979, I appreciate your help in wanting to forward test the EA. If you are able to provide feedbacks during the testing, do drop me an e-mail for the latest version. Bernard

--- 帖子 #645 ---
I have received some e-mails that the modified copy is crashing again for some and working smoothly for others. I have both modified copies running pretty well and fine on Vista and XP. This is indeed quite baffling. I will look through again for the cause, so stay tune for another revision. In the meantime, use whichever version that is not causing problem for you, until I have the next problem free version up. Bernard

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I have 3 trades so far with the latest version of 1h. 1 sell usdjpy with profit $1.03 , 2 buy usdcad, one with profit of $48.87, the other profit of $0.86. All trades with 0.1 lot size, and default settings. I wonder why two of the trades has less than $2 TP. Bernard, is it possible to get explanation of the parameters and how they affect the EA? Thanks. ps: can anybody teach me how to post the result from MT4? thanks.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I'm using the same broker but I have zero trade with version 1h, that's weird.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Try using alpari UK demo, it is producing trades. Bernard

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I just saw your latest email regarding trades not opening in your new demo. I'll try it and see if it open trade.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
This question has been asked a few times and replied to previously on a number of occasions. The EA has 3 hours (default) ProfitCutOffTime to trigger Trailing Stop (Min SL + Spread) and enter into safety. If it cannot do that, after the expiry of ProfitCutOffTime, the EA attempts to close the trade in profit at the first opportunity. As long as profit is greater than 0, that position will be closed. Once Trailing Stop is triggered, restriction imposed by ProfitCutOffTime no longer apply as the trade is in profit. Min SL = Minimum Stop Loss allowed by broker. This is different for different brokers. InitialStopBuffer = A buffer space above/below Min SL + Spread. TS is triggered when price reached or exceeds Min SL + Spread + InitialStopBuffer. PivotBuffer = A buffer space surrounding Pivot/Support/Resistance Levels. Actual space surrounding Pivot/S/R is Spread + PivotBuffer. The rest of the parameters are self explanatory or have been explained before. Just refer to past postings. To post results, 1. Right click any place at Account History. 2.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
i think it's working becoz i saw this message 2009.05.12 11:23:36 Forex_Trend_Catcher Ver 1h EURGBPFXF,H1: Near Pivot Level Is it possible to remove the message ? It's showing every second [each pair showing the message] and taking the computer resource. It will compound to thousands of such message in a day.

Do you mind pasting the quote on your 1st post ? Thnx.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
On what time frame is the EA most effective ? What are you guys running it on ? M30 ? H1? H4 ?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
The messages are important to me to track EA's logic. The messages are never kept permanently, so no resource space is taken up. Bernard

--- 帖子 #655 ---
InitialStopBuffer and PivotBuffer are not used by version 1f. There is no point in posting it there. Bernard

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Trend Catcher EA is best used on H1 time frame. Bernard

--- 帖子 #657 ---
hi all great..you guys have a trade,i still dont have any trade,im using alpari us with default setting,guys any suggestion why im still have no trade thanks

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Check the latest modified copy sent to your e-mail. Use this copy to trade. Bernard

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Got trades going again after the last corrected installation of the EA. 6 trades and all without a loss on M5 settings. Changed just now to H1 now to follow your earlier suggestion on TF. Will report on results end of the week.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Prosper4Rex, I sent you an email request for the EA license on my live account. Thank you so much for sharing! Bob

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Bernard, I am running v1h (latest one I received) on the following pairs: Eur/Usd ; Usd/Chf ; Gbp/Usd ; Usd/Jpy ; Usd/Cad ; Aud/Usd ; Eur/Gbp ; Eur/Chf ; Eur/Jpy ; Chf/Jpy Attached are my results from yesterday. Two noticeable things: - All trades were profitable - There were two consecutive trades on Usd/Cad after the first one closed the EA waited 1 hour, decided it is still trending and made another one Today no trades yet. I'll keep you posted with my results. Thank you for all your work so far, Oren

--- 帖子 #663 ---
why some of your trades doesn't have SL ? You remove them ?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
As I understand it, in this version the SL (At least the initial) is hidden and activated by the EA when reached. Bernard, please confirm/add about this as you are the only one who really knows how this works. Oren

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Version 1h implements a hidden SL feature to thwart stop loss hunting by some brokers. The SL appears only after Trailing Stop is triggered. By this time, the open position is in profit and there is no incentive to trigger off SL . The EA still protect a losing position should the price surpassed the hidden stop loss. For example, with a hidden SL of 100 pips, should an open position equals/exceeds -100 pips, EA will automatically close that losing position. Without a SL in view, no stop loss hunting is possible. Bernard

--- 帖子 #666 ---
maybe u are right. I didn't have any trade at the moment, so I don't know that it doesn't have a SL. However , I think a fake SL should be place. If any unexpected event happen the SL is there. It could be possible the currency pair spike 500 pips when your computer is down or internet connection is down or your broker connection is down. maybe a fake 150 SL is good or maybe a random number between 150 - 200 can be place as fake SL.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Good idea regards Andy

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Whether you have a real or fake SL in place, once broker launched a stop loss hunting program against you, your SL will be taken out and you incur that loss. If your computer is down, internet connection is down, broker connection is down - nothing can help you. Bernard

--- 帖子 #669 ---
what i mean is having 150 fake SL is preventive SL just in case something goes down for a long period of time and the market reverse the other way. If internet is down for only a few minutes the SL 150 wouldn't have any impact and wouldn't have any use. In rare event, the 150 SL might prevent unexpected big loss.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
If one can be summarily executed in this way (during major price movements /spikes when connection is down), then it will be best to not trade this EA on a Monday, Friday or any major news day, or am I wrong?........... Regards Andy

--- 帖子 #671 ---
The hidden SL is there to prevent any untoward losses from happening. It is hidden from stop loss hunting program, but is there in the background to protect losing position. Whether you have a fake 200, 500, 1000 pips SL , as long as SL is there and seen - it can be taken out. Bernard

hi guys.. is someone using alpari(us)?coz i still dont have a trade.. regards deen

hi again... bernard is it because i put the daily pivot and trade range on my chart so that the EA wont work or it doesnt matter whether if i put it or not... regards

i am using ALPARI RUS and not a single trade yet

--- 帖子 #677 ---
i dont understand watt the problem is with sl broker can only hunt just a couple of pips because lets say he moves to get your stop loss hit but it also gets pepole to gain in the same time he cant just hunt eash trader sepuratly

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Some brokers take positions against you. You buy, they sell and you sell, they buy. It means, if they are to win - you have to lose. Some unethical ones resort to stop loss hunting. Stop loss hunting programs are used randomly to hunt, there's no need for manual intervention. Bernard

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Still running the system 24/7 on VPS on a $500usd demo and it has been sitting about break even (small wins small losses) , been too busy to update sorry. I noticed a update 1h but cant find a link.

Hi Bernard Demo traded UsdJpy, EurGbp, GbpUsd, EurUsd on IBFX yesterday till 14h00 today, no trades. Fluctuating wide spreads encountered at times on IBFX with exception of EurUsd, so set SpreadLimit higher, still no trades. This afternoon, dropped forward testing of EurUsd &amp; GbpUsd. Continued demo trading EurJpy, UsdJpy, UsdCad, EurGbp on IBFX since 14h00 - no trades. EurUsd and GbpUsd will now be backtested separately. Regards Andy

Hi Bernard, Thanks for V1h, I have the 3rd copy loaded on my FXDD standard Demo yesterday over 8 pairs, at 0.01 lots. Got a buy trade almost straight away on EURUSD &amp; 5 min later a buy on GBPUSD. Both now closed, EU +1 SL &amp; GU full SL . Noticed GBPJPY (9pip spread) didnt show the Pivots text labels like the other pairs. Increased SpreadLimit to 9, labels now showing. EURGBP has 9 pip spread also, I didnt increase its SpreadLimit but Pivot labels are showing. I may have a look at winding back the TakeProfit. But this is a ranging market on most pairs. Need some volitility, somebody break something then fix it quick, how about GM, that might do it. Take care folks cheers scalpz

Sorry about that chief... Didn't know, and I doubt I can change it now ..

I'm in the same boat with the same broker.

I have two trades taken yesterday , GBPUSD and USDJPY, on demo a/c Alpari UK . Default settings. Bernard

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Had five trades, 4 postive, at 40.00 but I had the EUR/JPY -103.96 that killed the four postive. On 1hr TF's the SL should be about 35pips

--- 帖子 #693 ---
I had 1 trade yesterday 0.1 lot sell GBPUSD, result -101.00 Today, 0.1 lot buy GBPUSD, result +1.00 Default setting.

Hi Bernard Forward testing on IBFX, still no trades since yesterday on EurJpy, UsdCad, UsdJpy, EurGbp.................... Back testing............... Herewith results from back testing EurUsd. All on IBFX broker.. ------------------------------------------- First session – 1 Mar to 18 Apr 2009 – a mixed period of market trending up and down. Used defaults. Then, tried different settings for the parameters, and compared results. Summary – in one EurUsd currency you can expect 1 trade every 2 days, Run 1a. Used defaults, 1H TF. 13 trades, net profit -12. (2 x -100 pip loss trades) - half long/half short trades Run 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e. All combinations of parameters gave the same results. Changed the Pivot buffer, TS Required, SL increment, Init Stop Buffer, Trailing Stop, Risk, takeProfit. Used 1H TF. Each run same result (question, what do these settings really achieve?) 13 trades, net profit -66 (2 x 100 pip loss trades) Run 1f. Excluded NY Open. Used 1H TF. 12 trades, net profit +159 (No loss trades) See Sample Reports "1f" and screen dump of trade 1 and 2 of 1 Mar 2009 . Problem is the many small profit trades of 1pip /5pips. Entry point /exit point needs refinement? Despite the major trends during this 5 week period, very few trades started and very few ”runs” initiated Run 1g. As per 1f. but used 5M TF, excludes London and NY open.. 124 trades, net profit -295 (7 x-100 trades, 1 x -227 trade). This is not conclusive till further testing done……………..56 trades short, 68 trades long. ----------------------------------------------- Second Session – 1 Aug 2008 to 11 Sep 2008 – a period of constant “short” trend, should test the true capabilities of the EA – it is a trend catcher! Summary : 5M timeframe the best??? Run 2a. 1H TF Used settings as per 1e above: 13 trades, net profit +27 (1 x -100 pip loss) Run2b Include NY open, and defaults – 1H TF 14 trades, net profit +48.37 (1x102 loss), Despite continual down trend for 6 weeks, half the trades were long /half short. Far too few trades initiated. Run 2c Not US open, and uses defaults – 1H TF 13 trades, net profit +43.37 (1x102 loss) Run 2d Defaults, not US open. 5M TF. 105 trades, +207.47. 56 short trades, 49 long trades – why almost 50-50 split during constant down trend?. See sample report - 2d Problem remains: Entry point/exit point. Too many trades ending with 1pip or 5pip take profit. In the continual down trend, most trades should have run to the full take profit. Run 2e Defaults, not US open, 1M TF 198 trades, -$835. 98 short, 100 long trades Run 2f, g, I, j. Inconclusive – 15M, 30M, 4H – all have poor results, whether London open/NY open included /or excluded. -------------------------------------------------- Hope this helps you Andy

Hi, Had another EURUSD trade yesterday, sell from 1.3573 for a SL of +16 pips. Could have been better, especially after failling to hold the S1 break. But +16 is definately prefered to the previous +1 or +2 pips of the earlier versions. Have an AUDUSD sell open at the moment from 0.7497. Looking a bit sad at -38 pips. May not get much more on the downside after the 196 pip drop yesterday. Still, will wait and see how the ea runs it. Bernard, Still haven't been able to figure out why there is occassionally such a large delay for the Pivot &amp; S/R labels being diplayed. Wonder if its possible to put in a couple of "Print( )" statements in the code on the next version issue to show how far the processing has got when it loads up. The Prints() should show in the bottom Expert tab, amongst the 'Object redraws done' etc. Maybe the ea is fully loaded and running, but something else has delayed the screen refresh with the display of the labels. cheers scalpz Edited: AUDUSD sell just closed at 0.7488 SL +9 pips. Good recovery.

Hi Bernard, Since my last post, I haven't had any trades done. This morning, I change the TF to 30 mins. Since then had one sell usdjpy traded +7 pips. Right now have another sell usdjpy running, so far -9 pips. Wonder why TF of 1h has no trade? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hi Check my post #695 above. The 30M TF has approx 2x more trades than 1H, while 5M has about 10x more. Problem is there are more 100pip losses! Andy

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hi Bernard. Have tested this on demo with good profit, want to try it live. Do you have a number for me? o_kvam83@hotmail.com Great job on this EA Do you have a version 1H now?? Could you send it to me? Regard Oddien

--- 帖子 #700 ---
I am also getting NO TRADEs. If anyone is getting multiple successful trades can you send some set files?

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I have gotten 3 eurusd and 3 usjpy trades so far, all went to profit. 1 usjpy is still in trade. I am using 1h version Dean

--- 帖子 #702 ---
hello i am demo with this system now too. isn´t TP 400 pips a little bit to much?? what pairs do you trade with that?

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Its a Trend catcher EA on 1 HR TF, so looking for a good trend, possibly 400 pips. Trades any pair.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
well ok, i got 3 trades opened on EUR/USD, GPD/USD and USD/CHF on the standart input settings since yesterday, all trades running into the wrong direction so far but i will keep you updated, actually they are open for 16-18 hours now. http://chloe.qenx.com/screen.gif

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Could you have a look at this report and tell me if this is normal for this system. http://chloe.qenx.com/fx/reports/dem...nd-catcher.htm thanks

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi, Yes, a number of 1, 3, 5 pip profit trades and some big draw-downs is the norm. Ea needs extra refinement. Andy

--- 帖子 #707 ---
This looks very typical of how trend catcher usually trades. My experience this time is slightly different. I have have had 4 trades in over a week. First -100 pips,then subsequent 3, +50 pips. The downfall all along had been the odd big lose. Hopefully prosper4rex hasn't lost interest. Haven't heard from him for a while.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
hmm yup. but does somebody actually trading this system live and for how long?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Nobody in their right mind would trade this system live. The version now is "h", and needs a lot more development.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
hm ok, thanks for the information

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Ironbark, could you suggest similar systems following on "trends" which are maybe more stable and allready beeing traded live? i am looking for a trend following full automated EA.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Try working through this thread. I you get any ideas, that might be relevant to this EA, come back and post them here. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=156889

--- 帖子 #713 ---
I think there might still be a problem with the magic number. I installed the EA on 4 pairs and they all say they have the same magic number. Certainly this could cause a mess when one pair trades it will effect the others.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Dear Bernard, I have read every post of this thread and really like what I am hearing. Could you please send me the license number to put on live account. Thanks so much in advance. Dane

--- 帖子 #715 ---

--- 帖子 #716 ---

--- 帖子 #717 ---
I just saw this thread today, what happened to this EA? is it still developing? if possible can i have the latest version since bernard is not uploading it anymore?

--- 帖子 #718 ---
great EA, i will test it, thank you

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Why is this a "great" EA ?? Are sure about floating such a suggestion ? No posts here concerning this "great" EA for bloody 6 years ... may be it's great BS ?

--- 帖子 #720 ---
thank for your EA, i will test it

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Have anybody tried 'Trend Catcher EA' by Yury Reshetov, om www.mql5.com ?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi I've installed this ea and it has put a face in the top right corner of the chart. But it has got a sad face. How do I turn it into a smiley face? Thanks for you help.
