Hi all, I want to share my strategy and get your opinions comments and views. The strategy I'm using is very simple and has been very succesfull so far. My rules: 1. NO leverage I have a 1000 eur account and I'm trading only 0.01 lots right now. I will start to trade 0.02 lots as soon as I reach 2000 eur margin and so on (or you can decide to go even slower by trading 0.02 lots only when your account has 3000 eur margin etc.) 2. SMALL TP I have a set TP of 15-20 pips on every trade, trading only pairs with low broker spread. 3. NO Stop Loss I do not set SL, so basically trades close only when TP is reached. (I'll explain later why) 4. No more than 5 trades open at the same time. Entry Condition: LONG when H4 PA closes above 5EMA SHORT when H4 PA closes below 5EMA That's it! I have been testing this method for 3 weeks now, Opened 29 trades in total Closed with TP 27 trades Still pending open trades: 2 (TP not yet reached) Making money trading 0.01 lots makes it really slow, but I'm slowly building account margin so I can start trading bigger lots. I dont use SL for this method, and that has been the key of success: Even when the trade reverses on me and goes -200/-300 pips against me, the fact that I'm not using the leverage, makes it affordable (you can whitstand such a reversal with no leverage and still open other trades!) The only bad thing is that a trade can stay open for days or weeks before reaching TP. But as I could see by testing, more than 90% of trades reach TP within 48 hrs. I try to compensate for the negative rollovers by entering in trades with positive rollovers (for example long on AUDUSD) What do you think of this strategy?

Stoploss is normally preferred over take profit. Stoploss prevents blowing your account, take profit prevents profiting 100 pips instead of 30. It's going to succeed until it doesn't and then you will lose all your profits and even more because of spread. If you wait and wait and wait you will not make any profit during that time because if you expose more capital you run the risk of busting your account despite not using leverage. Long story short: put your money in the bank. It's more profitable then this.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
thing is that risking that little, I could afford a drawback on a single pair of more than 500 pips without needing to close the trade. I have to be very unlucky for having 5 pairs going all 500 pips against me . I agree that it could happen though. But for example, I have 2 trades still pending now for several days already. But the other trades I have closed with TP already compensate for these two. Plus, I can still manually close those trades that look to be going beyond control.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi Nacho,, Sorry to burst your bubble. You are not the first person to think of this method. Many other have thought the same before you. And to this day, the veteran traders will tell you that your money is safer in the bank. There is truth to the saying that the wise focus on managing the risk. The fools focus on the profit.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
You can see a 7000 Pips upwards move on EURUSD for example (click on monthly timeframe and zoom out, then you can see it). You say that you can close a position which goes too far into drawdown, but that is not how real life works. Because you always hope that price will turn around .... I trade a different method, somebody called it lock-unlock. I freeze a floating loss with a position in opposite direction, same lot-size. Therefore I will never get a margin call like you and I never have to watch the floating loss getting bigger and bigger, hurting more every day or week. With my method , price can go 100000000 Pips against my initial position and will not hurt me. I will finally close the whole thing at breakeven or in profit, even if it takes days or weeks or months. Since you play with smallest lot-size, you can survive with your method for many months, if not years .... but you could lose your account or at least a big chunk of it next week or next month when you are on the wrong side of the trend in one or more pairs.

Thanks for yr comments. I am aware of these shortcomings, and I'm looking for ways to make this strategy feasible. As I heard many times, being succesfull requires you to have the hedge of probabilities in your favour. Aiming at 15 pips TP after a PA cross of 5EMA on H4 seems to me a very likely event to happen. This doesnt mean that one or more trades could be a failure. In order to avoid huge drawbacks of 7000+ pips like you pointed out, I could then use your lock-unlock method or set a hard SL, say 1000 pips per pair. SL/TP ratio will still be far unbalanced, but this is compensated by the fact that probabilities should be in my favour.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
To raise your probabilities, make sure you are on the right side of the 5EMA on the daily chart.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Why don't you use the old historic high/low idea? Use a monthly chart and when price comes near a historic high or low for a pair and then starts moving away then take a trade in that direction. You should be able to hold the trade open for a few thousand pips rather than 15 and your downside risk is only as far as the historic high/low or as far as it goes on it's trip into uncharted territory. This doesn't mean you won't have drawdown and sometimes for a good few hundred pips but your upside potential is a lot greater. I still wouldn't recommend trading this way but it's an idea that crossed my mind once.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
No leverage means your trading 1:1 For a 0.01 lot long position eurusd you need 1000€ margin if trading without leverage So you are still using leverage if you can open several trades

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thanks for the suggestion, I could add this to the existing strategy, I guess that PA approaching historic high/lows is a quite rare event. Similarly, I try to enter trades on support and resistance bounces.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
umm yeah, you are right but at the moment thats the only thing I can do having just 1000eur margin and being the smallest tradable lot 0.01 I think I will still trade 0.01 if and when I reach 2000eur margin.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
no SL for ur kind of primitive technical system? Crap! rude but true think it another way: if ur way works, the whole population of this world is millionaires.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yes, the only danger in your method is a big move finding you on the wrong side. As I said, I would freeze the floating loss instead of taking a terrible loss and there will always be plenty of opportunities to unlock the freeze and make a breakeven or a profit from it. But that is me and everybody is different and it would not fit their needs or preferences.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
charvo, the reasons why the whole population of this world is not millionaires is obvious: 1. they cannot understand the method and will never trade it 2. if everybody understood it, it would not work because there would be no buyers or sellers on the other side of the trade. 3. Equity grows slow, now way to become a millionaire with 1k starting balance. Your rude "Crap" on the other hand is the 100% guarantee that the strategy will work forever. You belong to category 1 like 99.99 % of all traders and therefore Nacho will always find the counterpart for his orders. This is not rude but fact.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
No risk = No reward. You'd make more money in bonds. No speculation necesary.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
it can just work until market is in range.....trend will blow up ur account.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hey Nacho, I like that you're going for the low risk strategy. I'm trying every day for the same thing. If you're open to the possibility of opening an order with 0.02 lots you could have your TakeProfit (15 points) for 50% of your order (0.01 lots), and have the other 50% do a Trailing Stop (15 points) or a Step-Stop. That way you get the initial profit you're system would produce, and still get to trail additional profits will smaller risk (since you already have your profit from your TakeProfit). I use the attached indicator for doing this automatically. Hope this helped a little.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Nacho, you dont feel the pinch becos you are using 0.0x lots.Thus, you think you can tolerate 1000 pips SL. But, I assume you WILL increase your lot size eventually. Why dont you create a spreadsheet and tabulate yr win/loss based on 0.0x, 0.x, 1.x, 1x. You will be able to understand yr strategy better. Just my 2 cents...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Good luck.You are learning losing habits. I rather not make money then learn terrible habits that eventually will wipe your account clean. My advice learn to trade properly . Here is my method which is combination of similar methods I went 8-0 my last 8 wins 5EMA 12 EMA 21 RSI and my favorite TDI My chart is self explanatory.I drew red lines when trades were taken. I place 1/2 order and after 10pips place another 1/2 and if it goes further my way I place another smaller amount.I close one by one depending how trade goes.Idea is by placing 1/2 order at 1st your exposure is less if you are wrong hence less damage.I close all my orders if it goes more then 15pips against me.Another day is just around.No need to hang on to losing trade. LOSERS AVERAGE LOSERS

--- 帖子 #20 ---
There really is no way you can get a margin call like that? I figured that even when fully hedged you would still need sufficient margin to take the hit. Or do trades that are up actually give back margin?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Nacho I do not think you are accurately following your rules if the 5 ema on the 4 hr is a conditon for entry. Now for price to reverse after your intial entry and drop say 50 to 80 pips it would have closed below the 5 ema on the 4hr chart after your initial entry. So given your rules you would stop and reverse the trade. So I do not see how you would have say a 100 pips and above drawdown without intiaiting an opposite position.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
If I have 0.01 lots long and 0.01 lots short on a pair, the margin required is zero. Not all brokers do that, but Pepperstone and many others do it. As usual US-brokers do not allow hedging, big brother is watching. But it can be done there too with 2 accounts. I would not do it like that, it is too much work (for me), but on brokers who allow hedging it is absolutely no problem. @Davit, you are playing in a different league where only 5 % are profitable. Have mercy on those 95% who feed the elite. At least some can make a few cents with methods like Nacho´s.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Interesting..! Been there , done that! Every path teaches you a lesson, I hope this one does Take that EMA off too, you should trust your eyes more than that

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Nachos learn how to trade with proper risk mgmt. NO Martingale(Recovery) NO not using stops. If you dont think you can do that may I suggest you head over to a Chips(Brijon) thread or Nanningbob or the latest greatest Alorente....As those boys think like you. You will probably learn something from them. Or perhaps flip burgers or deliver newspapers. You will surely make more. Is it just me or is this nonsense becoming the norm ?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
just another useless ''strategy'' ... i hope there arent a lot of newbies burning their money again in here... sad thing is that the forexfactory crew publishs this thread as ''hot thread'' via facebook...hope they are not serious...otherwise i should rly think about closing and deleting my account here.... good luck.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Well, I do not take EVERY trade that respects my rule, since I'm not a full time trader and dont have the time to stay and watch the charts for long. I just enter when I happen to spot a trade that satisfies this rule. So lets say I saw a H4 candle closing above ema, I would enter long, TP 15 pips. Should PA reverses after my entrance and H4 closes below the ema (without hitting my TP - which is unlikely but happens), then yeah, I am supposed to open another position (short this time),TP15. The main idea is that both trades will hit tp at some point because PA never goes just in one direction. I'm not saying this strategy is perfect, but has had a very good win ratio so far, and I'm looking for ways to better manage the risk. The idea is being able to whitstand floating losses trading with no leverage. As long as I can whitstand floating positions and still open other trades I dont see major problems and account have been growing so far.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I found few posts here thus far actively promoting "gurus" products for sell to unsuspected. Perhaps there is a connection but I am not sure.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I dont understand all the hatred, I just wanted to share something I'm trying and that works for me, and of course I'm open to suggestions and criticism, but there is no need to offend since i'm not offending anyone.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
have a look at the Bird watching in lion country book. you should have a exit strategy, if the trade goes wrong, praying wont do it, but theres nothing wrong with having a large stop, but you should know roughly how much you want to risk, just dont make it 100% you may want to have a look at multiple entries as your 1 trade breaking your current entry into several smaller trades which you enter on different levels. N

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Do it work or do you still try it ? In my opinion you are sharing a strategy that cant even work in theory... Please note : If you are new to this forum,thread,business etc. DO NOT FOLLOW THIS STRATEGY unless you dont want to burn your money.... If you want to '' burn '' your money, use this link: http://www.supportunicef.org/site/c....Donate_now.htm

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks! I will try this.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
i know a pro investor, he enters $1 per pip for every 10$k in his account. he holds his position until profit, but you hav to be willing to be stuck in a trade for years. the other way is to only enter 0.10$ initially and then reenter if it goes say 500 pips against u, this averages your price. i could never trade this way....good luck with ur trading.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
but to wipe out 100% of my account trading 0.01 lots, assuming 1 pip worth is abt 7 euro cents, means I have to lose more than 14000 pips. I only open no more than 5 trades at the same time. It is very unlikely that this could happen. Anyway, I agree that I need to set up an exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Nacho, with your 1:1 leverage you can indeed take a huge amount of pips of floating loss. But think about this, what if you come to this point where a trade has been going against you for 2 months, you do everything you can but not working well, and floating loss combined with growing negative swap now threaten 50% of your total account. What would you do? 2 options 1. Cut loss, losing 50% of your total account as a reward for trading for 2 months with the most hard-working analysis you can come up with? 2. Keep the trade open and stay in a business that gives you no money but instead put you in such a difficult time for 2 months and now you embrace an even darker future and risking even bigger? Without SL you are open to such risk just to get 15 pips. I'm not saying financial risk only, but also the stress you may get, the sense of being stuck &amp; not making any progress, the sense of failure. You can lose many things in your life just for 15 pips. Aren't you wanna be happy and live in peace? This is just something to think about, I'm not your daddy after all xD If I were you, I'd choose a better risk to reward ratio =)

--- 帖子 #35 ---
There is no hatred. Just some traders who have been around the block many times and know from experience that this does not work. Were just telling you "how it is"... Were telling you that you are wasting your time. I am serious go get a part time job and you will make more money than this can ever give you. That you can take to the bank... Last I am saying here as this thread should not even be here. Bluesteele

--- 帖子 #36 ---
nacho, you might feel safer entering say 5 different pairs, but the reality is that when a large trend is forming, those 5 pairs will most likely go in the same direction making your losses huge. hedge after a 100 pip loss and learn the art of unhedging. good luck

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank you! I will definetely try the hedging way.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I 've been trading that way for months . The only problem for me was not enough patience in too many markets !!! You have it right with .01 per 1000 but think of little longer term trading and as someone else mentioned .01 every 500 pips against .. Will work eventually .. GOOD LUCK !!!!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
ridiculously ridiculous, I mean everything.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
OK OK you got me ....LOL This thread has to be an April Fool's joke???? Good one !

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You are right, I'm basically risking it all for 15 pips and I am conscious of it. The idea I'm believing in is that as long as I trade small and I have probabilities in my favour this will not happen, and before I arrive to lose half my account I think I'll have already have found some counter measures such as hedging the losing position (still have to figure out the rules), or the sum of other succesful trades will compensate for one big loss (That would still mean a waste of time, but at least not a waste of money) Time will prove me right or wrong...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I think you should follow your path and find what works for you, test it and refine it. Many traders do not use stop loss and are profitable. Look Forexcube thread and its "Loss Order Management". I do not think there is only one truth in this business! So, no-sl vs sl, long-term vs scalping etc. is all crap for me! IMHO

--- 帖子 #43 ---
If a pair goes 500 pips against you, don't you think you should rethink how you are entering trades? BTW, I don't know how to find a good trade either.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
bluesteele, maybe you're joking, but when I read this thread's first post, I thought: "Is this guy for real? No, it must be an April Fool's joke!"

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I believe entering on a H4 cross of ema is a good entry rule, in fact have reached tp most of the time (not hard since my tp is only 15/20 pips) before going that far against me.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
thanks Rob216, I will check out that thread!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
You can make money with the strategy but you still need an exit method on losing trades at some point. I can see the usual SL crowd is out to rip you. I trade one penny per 500 and my results over the years, yes I said years, is 5-10% a month. so you could look at results of 2.5-5% a month. Even still there still is a point I take a loss. So you still need a money management systme where you know a trade aint coming back to 0. You dont need a SL but you do need an exit strategy of some kind.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
The reason is their belief system, it allows no room for creative thoughts outside of the box. That pattern would not necessarily be a problem in itself, but when it is dwelling in a person who is hosting rudeness, arrogance and bitterness, then it is explosive and turns into aggressiveness against those who do something which goes against the engraved dogma of the SL cult.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
This is Nacho thread and I will let him defend himself but if you analyze their argument it goes like this. We trade this certain way, only professional traders trade this way, so any method other than our method is not professional. I can easily defeat that argument by looking at a COT chart. You can see three groups of professional traders who have to register their trades. You can see that one group is almost always contrary in their trading direction to the other two. That means, they dont trade the way some say only professional traders trade. To trade contrary to others you have to trade smaller lots, with less leverage, and with different rules than the tight SL method. To say otherwise is ludicrous. So, I am off to work. Good luck and Nachos I see you started this on April Fool's day, that maybe be design or not. If you really want to discuss your strategy you will have to ban certain individuals from your thread or you will never get to discuss the actual strategy. There are professional traders who trade one or two indicators and that is it. Using one is not a bad or unsound method but it must be combined with an exit method at some point.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
lol, nice April Fool's! You know though that there are people who actually believe in this way of 'trading' and try to sell their ideas to others!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
If you understood the numbers it would take 100,000 pips in losses to blow his account. That is trading .01 one penny per pip. My question would be this, can you teach us how to lose 100,000 pips to make your statement come true?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
if he trades with the longer term trend and uses a larger stop, i see no reason for it not to work. I would advise on taking some larger profits as-well as the smaller ones though - to help offset some of the bigger losses. I know of a small group who trade in a similar fashion and are making money and have been doing for years. They must be doing something right, i cant say that given the swings in the markets over the years that its all luck.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Sounds just like nanningbob's strategy. Not surprised at all to see his name at the bottom as current viewing this thread, hehe. Hello Bob! No leverage definitely is safer. I would only trade no stop with positive swap if I had tons of money to park and didn't want to have to look at it for months or years. With no stop loss you could be in a trade for a very long time waiting for your take profit to hit all the while accruing relatively small interest for the amount of margin being consumed. Otherwise I have found it is more profitable and more efficient use of time to actually trade actively. If you have an effective method you can have a higher rate of turnover. Therefore more compounding. Just my 2 cents, as they say.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
By that logic it would then take 100,000 pips to double his account. Might as well take that money and put in a retirement account or bonds and save yourself the time. You might also save on the power it takes to run your computer.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi 2+2, not really interested in debating in another guys thread, but he has the right idea if he is interested in trading safely and long term. If I understand his system and lot size he probably would do around 2-5% a month which is much better than a bank or bonds at 3% a year. However, he doesnt have a place where he will take a loss, something I would do. So that leaves it open to question. Anyway, have fun, I am going to respect another's thread and leave him teach his own system. If it has merit people will follow, if not, it will die. : )

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi nacho ! Hi nanningbob ! It's funny to read the "hatred" posts here. I just posted sth. on another thread that has almost the same topic and I only can say: I support your views. What I realized over the years is that there are different ways to achieve your goals. What I wanted was a month, better day by day, good performance and it'S hard to achieve and practically not possible by this method lots of 10 vouches guys pray: go with the market, use TP 3x SL 1x. I checked ALL kind of stuff and guess what ? Your ratio is a good as 1:1 by TP 3x and SL 1x. Why ? Cause you get hit 3 times on SL and 1 time on TP. That's the truth. You need an edge. That's the key and this edge you can get like nanningbob (see posts before) or nacho tries. Or you try to get the trends but that's really hard and also not my trading style. Don't give up Nacho ! There are different ways. And that's what you try works out but make much more backtesting. This is really important. As Cloggie said: "Develop a System and seek the Drawdown 10(1year is enough I would say on short time frames) years back, double it at least and see if you can stand this. Then start to trade." Do your homework and market will benefit. Don't be fooled... I needed 5 years of developing lots of stuff, going on gambling and so on to find something that works. keep up ! greets Jack

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I have tried to provide support, no 2 traders are the same and will have very different trading styles. I did mention bwilc to you. Trade in the direction of the trend keep an eye on the fundamentals. Use multiple entries on different levels. And have a rough idea of how much draw down your prepared to take before starting to scale out. For me having a stop too close to the market resulted in premature stop out, when i started to trade longer timeframes, i found myself trading less, and earning more. N

--- 帖子 #58 ---
fxtr51 can you describe your lock / unlock strategy ? how do you come out of profit / break even if you are hedged , there will always be a loss as one trade in profit, the other in loss ?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
i think i know what he means. Basically once a position goes against you, you place a trade in the opposite direction (a hedge / lock) when price comes back down and takes that trade off it then unlocks it. I used to do a similar thing, but i found that if i was going to take a trade in the opposite direction, and i am happy with the direction of the fundamental trend, i would take the profit, rather then it come back to take the lock off.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
what you said is CRAP! i only defined what u've said is crap. u see, i didn't define you are a loser, but u defined me. ur so-called "lock-unlock" may works, but not due to the smart "lock-unlock", it is due to your decision has an "edge". meaning that out of 100 times, you have more than 50 times to be right, statistically (assuming 1:1 R/R). with an "edge", u do whatever u can, no prob. but a noob comes here, read ur "CRAP", and believed it is due to your smart "lock-unlock" way. then this noob is focked up by the misbelief that you presented here. for a noob, (due to a win rate lower than 50%), he might easily run into this situation: whatever he does, the market will go against him. he long, market drop, he short to hedge, market rise again, he long to follow, the market drop again....... then the noob will be collapsed......

--- 帖子 #61 ---
This works. It requires paitence and discipline, but it works. When someone has found something that works for them, they automatically think its the way to go and no other way works. They probably have tried this method and didn't like it which is why they have such hatred for it. BUT I DO ADVISE USING A SL FOR LEVERAGED POSITIONS, ALWAYS. I have a similar trading plan. Except I have one trade open and don't open another until I breakeven that trade, giving it room to run. Averaging in losing positions (which goes againt the professional mindset but at 0.01 lots, its technically impossible to get a margain call) in 1000pip gaps. But again, this requires an incredible amount of paitence which is why I (and you) need other avenues of income. In the end, it all adds up.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
whatfx, it is amazing, most of those who flame others here never asked that. They discuss their own prejudices and beliefs only. In other words: they offend and vent and have no clue at all what they are talking about. Strange world, isn´t it ? A big hello to all naysayers. Here is a screenshot which says it all. I will only answer to sober and serious questions though, but I think you already showed that you qualify. http://i.imgur.com/X9SRP.jpg

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Nacho, for me trading should feel safe and making progress. That is why I use SL to avoid extremely bad possibilities like blowing account or stuck for weeks/months in a losing trade. With that I can easily move on if the price movement I expected doesn't come, set positive expectation for the next trades, and sleep tight at night. Trading with SL, there will be profit and loss, and probably string of losses (which can happen to any business). It's all healthy. String of losses are the test of true entrepreneur/trader. If you can face it, smile to it, and survive, you are stronger than the world. Market will then bow to you and have no option but to start giving you positive results in its own way. I am not lecturing you to use SL, just sharing what have been working for me. You can do such thing too if you are interested, if not, no problem. Your life your adventure. Good luck

--- 帖子 #64 ---
That's a good one! charvo, do you have a clue what are you talking about? Because fxtr51 doesn't think you do!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
[quote=charvo;5534244]what you said is CRAP![quote] No. It does. I need no statistics, but in order to trade the lock-unlock you need patience and a basic understanding of S/R , candle patterns and stuff. It is not for a noob. Yes. I never presented a misbelief. You are doing that. A noob can learn it, it is not rocket science. And if he does it correct, he will never get a margin call or collapse. Before he is mastering it, he should not go live. Isn´t that what he should do with all strategies ? So what´s up ? Where is your problem ? Saving noobs ? You should know that 10 traders get 10 different results with the same strategy, right ? If you teach them the SL belief system, 8 will lose money and 1 will break even and 1 will make money. Such is life. If I teach them the lock-unlock, 1 will lose, 1 will break even and 8 will make money. Simple as that.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thank to those who gave meaningful opinions and suggestions instead of just sniping at the method. I am aware that it needs to be adjusted with a sound risk management rule/strategy. I'm interested in reading about different risk management methods that go beyond just putting a SL. I also have traded with SL, but have found out afterwards that most of my trades would have been winners without it...if just I had the patience to wait. I'm not expecting to become millionaire with this method. But I think it can produce a consistant, even if small, source of profit. The most difficult part is at the very beginning, when account is small, and therefore lots are also small. I have to enter many trades per week in order to make some money. As soon as I will have bigger margin, I will increase lots size accordingly, always avoiding leverage. By then, trading 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 lots will mean that I will need to enter fewer trades to make the same amount of money. So I think that if I can be succesfull now that I trade many small lots, it will be all downhill from here. P.S. As of today, I have a 4,2% account return in 3 weeks using this method, and floating loss is about 1,6% of my account as of now.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I respectfully disagree. I would say: if you teach them the SL belief system, 95 will lose money and 5 will make money. I'm not so sure about that. Let's hear what charvo thinks about that!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
From what I understand there are four ways to handle a losing trade. 1. Hang on until a trade hits 0. That could take a short time to years. 2. Use a specified stop loss system. 3. Use some kind of recovery or multiple level system. 4. Use a hedge or opposite trade to stop the increasing DD until you unhedge the trade at a reversal point. Not interested in 1, use 2 some of the time, use 3 most of the time, not allowed to use 4 in the USA. The problem is those who use 2, there is a very small group of very nasty individuals who cant comprehend or understand anything else or the rest just does not compute to them as viable. Some people can think 3 dimensional and can make other money management systems work. Short summary of each: 1. You really cant use leverage or must be extremely small leverage, very small lots. Seldom has a losing trade. 2 allows you to use low to high leverage, large lot trading methods. 3. uses low leverage small lot trading methods 4. allows you to use high leverage, medium to large lot trading methods.

well, in my experience hedging does not work. it certainly has never worked for me in any case... various problems arise. such as what to do in a ranging market when simultaneous buy / sell signals are happening. you will be locking / unlocking your hedge several times and taking losses. if you unlock your position, what happens if the price then rebounds and continues in that direction. you will be losing again before entering another hedge ? instead of hedging why not just close the position and enter a trade in the opposite direction as per your charts signal. and then re enter in your original direction when the right signal is given ? but if hedging works for you, then good luck to you ..!

I understand that. It is an art. No, I never take losses. When I unlock, I close the winning position only with a profit. And place a pending order above/below in case the market continues in that direction. There is no loss, only a bigger distance (risk) in case my new pending is triggered. But we are talking about new floating loss of 1,5 or 2 % instead of 1 %. Since I usually unlock at good levels, I only have to lock again once or twice before the market releases me into an overall breakeven or profit. Just an example: For a few days I had a lock in GBPJPY and since it is a demo and I am playing to test extreme situations, I had a floating loss of 10 % on that lock. I unlocked a few times at the wrong level and booked 14 % profits, but had to lock again while all the time my Short was there floating. Yesterday I caught the good level and unlocked. I placed a TP for my Short above its entry and placed a pending long which was never triggered. This morning I woke up and boooommm. GBPJPY had hit my TP for the Short, so it closed with a 2 % loss. Now: 14 % profit minus 2 % loss = 12 % profit on the whole thing. That is the way it works. I always end with either a breakeven or a profit. No. I don´t lose ever. The only loss is on the initial position, but at a place where my overall result is a breakeven or a profit. Because I feel better and because I can sleep well and because my profits are much bigger than yours if you trade all signals like I do and you take the loss and I lock-unlock. If you take your loss and trade in the opposite direction, you can get whipsawed like crazy and lose on every trade until the market has mercy on you and breaks out, but you will not recover from the whipsaw if you don´t increase your risk. I neither increase my risk nor does a whipsaw like that harm me . Has nothing to do with luck. It is just more profits, but on the other hands more work and requires more patience and skills .... which pays good rewards for the effort taken.

Can you provide more details on your technique, because so far nobody has managed to make it profitable? It's known as futile hedging. Let me give you an example and correct me if I misunderstood your way of doing it. Suppose at some point you buy the euro at 1.3000, assuming that it will go up, and you have a target at 1.3050 (50 pips), that would be 1% of your account. If the market drops to 1.2950 you don't take a loss of 50 pips (1%), instead you open a sell position. At this point you have "locked" a 50 pip loss no matter which way the price goes from here, but both your positions are still open. Let's say the price keeps falling. When do you take profit on the short position? Let's say you do it at 1.2900. So now you added 1% to your account, but the buy you have left from 1.30 is a 2% negative trade. Now it's clear that if the market comes back to 1.2950 you manage to close that with a loss of only 50 pips and overall you're breakeven (spread excluded). But what if it keeps falling and gets to 1.2850? There you probably open a fresh short, but you locked a 150 pip loss at this point (3% of the account) and you only managed to close a 1% gain so far. Overall you are losing 2% so far. I hope you see where this is going. If the market is in a tight range moving up and down between the same 2 levels you make money, closing shorts and longs. However when a trend develops even if you only close the positive trades overall your equity drops. The counter-trend position you have open is bigger than the positions you manage to close in profit. Also the distance between your 2 open positions gets bigger and bigger, you will always be bought at a top and sold at a bottom. Even if our downtrend stops at 1.25 let's say and then an uptrend develops, in a few months you will be left with a sell at 1.25 when the market price is around 1.35.

If you follow the example above then the outcome will be as described - when hedging you have to know when to keep only a single side of the hedge open or to increase one side of the position to compenaste for a directional bias. For example once a trend establishes you then trade in the direction of the trend at 1.3x the original size up to the point of break even. If you understand your risk amplitude ( your leverage ) then you can manage your position.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
In addition to the above you can construct a triangular hedge which will not impact you trading in USA and will also allow you a greater flexibility; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_arbitrage : the same principle and thus leaving you market neutral, which also will allow you to adjust your lot sizes as needed.

I doubt that nobody has managed to make it profitable. I am not the only one who did. Ask Favorite, he is doing it too ... and as far as I know with success. Yes, I know the way to the abyss and therefore avoid it. That is the art and therefore not everybody can do this. Because it requires patience, discipline and a good understanding of the market ( price patterns, S/R and that stuff ). It is not different from taking the loss like you do . Because you cannot show trade blind and without understanding Price Action and all of that. 95 % fail to do it right, if we believe those who always are telling us that. Here is my veto in our security councel. Because this will only happen if a trader does not understand all the stuff he should know before starting to trade with real money. It is like saying that nobody on earth will ever be profitable in Forex because nobody is finding an entry which will give him a profit. Is that true ? Somebody said: Open a H4 chart, attach a 14 SMA and tell me if you could profit. Or use the Alligator or whatever , the 50 SMA or the good DiNapoli stuff and trade on higher timeframes with those .... and if you don´t do everything wrong, you can make profits. So, if you assume that I cannot find a good pullback or reversal of 50 Pips on a H4 chart to unlock and wait until the market gives me those 50 Pips before it continues to nag me, then you are correct, then I will unlock and lock again 50 times in a row and my floating loss will increase, but please, LazyPawn ..... let us look at every H4 chart we can find and then you will have to admit that only a blind and maybe stoned trader will do it so terribly wrong. I say: No. Because I zoom out on the charts. Then I look at the big picture and S/R and Trendlines and Fib levels and therefore I only need 1 or 2 additional locks, but never 20 or 30 of them. Just looked on a H4 chart of EURUSD. I see pullbacks of 100 - 200 Pips in a major trend before the trend continues. Fib-traders profit daily from such pullbacks to 38, 50 or even 78 Fib levels. They happen all the time and there I unlock and enjoy the ride to my be-level and beyond into profits.

fxtr51, This has nothing to do with how good a trader is, or how well one can read the charts. The point is that keeping the losing trade open doesn't add to profitability compared to taking a small loss on that trade and opening another trade when you "know" that you are right. If you have a locked position (say 50 pips loss) you still have to make a decision at some point in the future, to close one of the two legs. Even if you read the chart well and close the right leg, overall your profit is not bigger than what you get if you take a loss first followed by opening a new position at the right point. You assume that you only make one mistake when you open the first position, which later you have to hedge. In fact, even if you are an exceptional trader, it could very well happen again later, when you think the market will reverse ... you could be proven wrong again and the distance between your open positions at the extremes just grows larger.

Nacho, Your approach can work, but you will need to put much more work into it then what you have so far. That said you will gain a lot from trading this way, especially with a very small account. You will learn quickly many aspects of trading. It is one thing to say that you can take a loss and another to actually ride out a 500 pip move against you. That said you need to put a lot of work into what you are doing. For one you should try to first make sure you can make money on a simple s/r / Moving average system. A simple 60/40% system will give you profits over a period of time. When you consider SL, you need to ask really what the principle of SL is? Most people automatically set a SL because well... That is a good practice and you should always set it... and this way you will avoid a catastrophe... The point is an SL order is nothing else then just an order to limit your risk. Setting one just because is never a good approach. On the other hand you should always limit your risk to a point that is adequate for YOU!. Not some number of X Pips or X $/EUR. You risk should only be defined by your tolerance. You on the other hand also need to consider the ramifications of what if you do get to that point of being stopped out. Btw you actually DO have a SL. The SL in your case is the Margin Call on your account, or the size of your account, and that is fine as long as you acknowledge that risk. One thing that you need to look at is that if you are prepared to risk 500 Pips, why should you not expect to make 500 Pips ? Why should your TP be only limited to 20 Pips ? If you are trading from a 4HR time frame you should want greater profits, in proportion to your risk. Hedging is a strategy that you can use to limit your risk. It takes a lot of experience and a magnitude of studying to learn, but the rewards are much greater then many other strategies. Here is a link that is very useful: http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-251 and will teach you how to properly use hedging. I believe its lesson 20-21, although anyone trading FX markets should take this course, especially since it is free. Ultimately you will succeed, because you are willing to think outside of the box, but the thought needs to be grounded in knowledge. GL

Why do you assume that my overall profit is not bigger than trading the conventional sl way ? Example: 3 x SL hit, then 1 winner. All with 1 % risk. The SL-believer has this result: -1 , -1 , -1 , + 1 = - 2 % net. The lock-unlocker has this result: 0 , 0 , 0 , + 1 = + 1 % net. In my books +1% is bigger than - 2 % loss. Then the normal trader has only losses and I will end up in breakeven or profit. esprit, great input from you. Thank you very much.

It can be, if the market is in a tight range, as I already said. The big problem is what happens when it starts trending. The problem is the next: You buy ... and it happens to be a top. The market drops 800 pips after that. During that 800 pip drop you open some shorts and get some pips selling, but you never get the entire 800 pip distance. You are lucky if you catch around 4-500. Because you don't open the short at exactly the same point as the previous one was closed. So ... you have 4-500 pips gained, but your loss is now 800. One of the biggest trading myths which stems from our psychology is that unrealized (floating) P/L is less significant than realized (already banked) P/L. I invite you to read 2 threads: Merlin's and Hannover's thread. Those guys know what they're talking about, and all experienced traders have the same opinion. It's a mathematical certainty that nedging is not a way to increase profits, on the contrary. This post has a good summary. But if you still think you're right by all means feel free to do it. I'm just warning you that many people have walked that path before and it's a losing one, same as martingale and grid trading strategies.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
nacho what if you open say a long, then market falls. and keeps on falling for the next few months ? never returns to your original position..... scary thought, eh ? complete wipe out !

--- 帖子 #81 ---
No, the loss is not 800. It is the initial distance + the additional distance(s) of additional locks. And I sometimes decrease the distance. Somehow you want to believe that I make 50 wrong unlocks in a row, but my experience is that I make 1 or 2 and then the market turns enough in the direction I need and I make breakeven or profits. In a big move of 800 or more Pips, there are plenty of good pullbacks and bounces from strong S/R levels where I can unlock and decrease the needed distance to be. I usually need 20 - 50 Pips to get to BE. And if you don´t mind looking at H4-charts, you will easily find pullbacks of 100 - 200 Pips or more during such a good moves. But even if I hold the losing position for the whole 800 Pips, finally the trend will change and then move 500 Pips or more into the direction while I only need 50 or 60 Pips to break even on my initial position. Would you grab 60 Pips from a 500 Pips move when your pending order is at a level where price doesn´t go for the next 5 months I grab 60 Pips from a 100 Pips move without stress. Especially when 60 Pips translate to 1 - 2 % risk. I did it with 20 % risk without stress. I am not bragging here but I simply have the facts on my side and the experience. The facts can be seen in historical charts and my experience I see in when I am looking into the mirror after waking up .

fxtr51, the guy just doesn't get it! You provided great explanation, pictures, examples, math, you just can't explain it better (nobody can!) - but he doesn't even want to try! It is much easier just to say: "it doesn't work because it can't work". A great argument, isn't it? Of course, if some idiot starts using locking tomorrow without any home work he will blow up his account. But if somebody trades demo let's say 3-4 months then he would master it and he would succeed.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Favorite, I had a few discussions with experienced traders and none of them had an argument which held water. Everything was fabricated out of thin air, like taking 30 to 50 losing setups in a row. One of my entry strategies is from the threads of 60minuteman. Buying only above 50 SMA and selling only below it .... on a H4 chart. signals taken from inside bars and engulfing bars. If the doubters would just take the time, open a H4 chart and plot a 50 simple moving average on it ... and for easier visualization use my 2 indicators for the signals ..... and then tell me they would make 30 wrong entries in a row, they should delete all Mt4 and Forex stuff on their PC and earn their living with something else because looking at such a chart, you can hardly find 2 or 3 losing entries in a row on any chart , most of the times only 1 at the exhaustion of a trend. So, even when I start with a 5% risk and hedge it and with bad luck make 2 additional locks and have a 8 % risk floating in loss, as soon as price goes to the other side of the 50 SMA, there will be plenty of levels to unlock and ride to breakeven or into profits. The whole lock unlock thing is not a big mystery. It is simple, but simple does not mean "easy". Because it requires patience and discipline and experience and knowledge of price patterns and S/R, basic stuff, which a newbie cannot know. Enough said: I have to lock and unlock a few more ...

fxtr51, I see that you don't trust books and experienced traders. You still think your method works because it has worked for a few months in some ranging markets. Please tell me what you do when you buy at 1.30 and the price starts dropping. Let's take this concrete example. When exactly do you open the first short, and when do you take profit on it? Then I'm ready to continue with the next market move. Or if you prefer I can also show you a chart from the past (I won't tell you what pair) and go with you bar by bar - you tell me your trading decisions. I can guarantee that you lose big. esprit - yes, same person.

very interesting link, i'll for sure to watch it. thanks. but "hedging is a strategy"? i reckon it is NOT, at least in the sense of Nacho or Fxtr. hedging is just a trading style or basis, at most. i heard that on streets, the hedging is actually for "portfolio manegement". the key is to maintain balanced (double sides protected), when the trader is quite sure (QUITE sure), he adds/subtracts a little from one side, if the market moves right, he'll exit with a small % profit. he may keep adding positions (in order to catch the trend) for a while. but at the end of day, if he kept going the wrong direction, he still finally end-up cutting losers (from his addings). the hedging boasted in this thread is really different from that above. fxtr is in fact saying that he trades, very frequently, when wrong, he'll hedge; when right, he'll take profit. this is such a perfect world, an utopian...... the truth is, this way can survive today, tomorrow, this year, even next 3 yrs...... but ultimately, in the long-term trading sense, it will fail. think it the other way, if fxtr can read the market that sharply, why not just SL and put another trade? if fxtr can NOT read it that sharply, why would he be so confident that the "market will return 100~200 pips" right after he exit one side of a hedge? it will come, that a trader find that he has lock-unlock for 10 times, and he's still trapped in a hedge; the only difference between 10 times later and before is that the distance (drawdown) between two sides are much much larger. i in fact would not post this much since there is little interest to me. my post only serves two purposes: 1. inexperienced new comers should be aware of the "success" of hedge traders. at least in this world, no one is rich because he hedges. 2. does one really ask himself is there in this world such a simple &amp; effective way to never lose but win only using the magic "hedge"? the market exists to go to a direction....... this is the fundamental. btw, i always smile when i see ppl saying "demo after 4 or 5 months, you'll learn it". c'mon, search FF for those threads, many yrs ago they were already there....... and dead now. i for sure cannot prove u r wrong today.

LazyPawn, Well thats good to know, we had a few games in the past. Anyway don't be so critical of what these guys are writing here. There are many books as you know , and you can employ hedging to make a great profit. I do, but I do it with correlated pairs, and have now for about 6 years. I trade standard systems of S/R and simple SMA 30,50,100,200, but I employ correlated hedging on the 15% of failed setups, and it is a very good strategy.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
charvo, You make some excellent points there. I am not trying to be confrontational - that should be obvious. It's really sad to see the same history repeating itself over and over again - accounts getting blown every time an inexperienced trader rediscovers martingale, grid trading, hedging and other similar techniques. But I don't know why I'm wasting my time instead of just letting them find the truth the hard way.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hedging is a strategy. Why not? A strategy is a methodology that is followed with a defined plan that seeks to achieve a desired outcome. When you open a hedge, of any type. I use a triangular hedge in Forex, but could just as easily be a pairs trade ( GM, FORD ) in equities or Gold / AUD; you seek to offset your risk. The reason why you would hedge your trade, when it goes "against" your "idea" of a direction, is to simply profit from a market cycle. If you trade in a general direction of the market ( say Daily ), you can always run into situations, where you will have short term fractal corrections. You will be stoped out on many of these, while the primary trend will continue.... But that is pretty obvious and I am sure you know that. Anyway I am only posting this to help the few that want to learn, and I always try to provide solid information behind the ideas. After all any strategy plan etc has to be based on solid foundation.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
esprit, as you can see, charvo posted his post before your post, that's why he's talking about 3 years. Otherwise he would say "10 years" or something like this. Of course, 3-4 months demo is nothing, and 3 years live is nothing, and 6 years live is nothing, and if you come here in 25 years and say "I do it for 30 years" somebody would say that 30 years is nothing, let's see you in 50 years...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Well... I personally do not subscribe to the demo mentality. Demo is great for learning the platform or statistical testing, but that's about it. You need to trade a real account to get a feel for any method. Even if that account is a mini or micro, but demo just doesn't cut it. That is why Nacho will succeed, even if this style will not fit him, he is using a real account, where there are real emotions and artifacts involved.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Sure, it depends on the personality. When I say "demo" I mean "training". When I test a new system I always trade live but a VERY small (0.01) lot size, but some people can't do it, so they should demo instead.

How convenient that you don't want to debate this again since myself and a few others proved how flawed and dangerous the logic is in trading without a stop loss. 2-5% a month trading without a stop loss? Really? Yea you might make 2-5% for a few months then one trade goes into drawdown and wipes all of it away in an instant. It not only takes your profit away, it then eats your principal balance. Then what Bob? Then you just hang in there for years collecting a miniscule amount of interest? By the time you get back to breakeven you've wasted years. Bob, you have a propensity to disregard time and how it relates to opportunity cost. Like I said, if you're going to risk dollars for pennies then you might as well put the money in a bond or cd. Now if you want to trade like the best of them, start using stops and risking pennies for dollars. That is how you take advantage of compounding and achieve a nice return. A return well worth the time. Good luck my friend.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
First off, i find this really an interesting concept which came to my mind before, but never actually had a proper plan and never pursued it. My question is 1)how many pips do you let a trade go against you before setting an opposing-trade(lock)? 2) You just put an opposite trade, price moved 5 pips further against you(i.e5 pips in favor of lock) and then it starts back in favor of your original trade. What do you do in that scenario? Do you treat you counter trade as if it was the original trade(reverse trades psychologically)? Or you just unlock for a small loss hoping to make up for it with ur original trade?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Why debate you, you dont even understand that a trade would have to go almost 100,000 pips in the hole to wipe out the account. You never have and you never will understand the concept. So It is not worth my bother. Many professional people trade differently than you propose. I can prove that by looking at a COT chart. There is one group always trading contrary to the other two. Therefore people with huge sums of money (so large they have to report their trades by law) trade differently than you propose. They do not trade high leverage, large lots to account size and dont use a tight SL. So good luck. Oh since we last met my account that I started with 1400 ( I started with a thousand and later added 400) and you laughed because it was around 2000 is now approaching 2700. hmmmmmm penny garbage but that is not the point. The point will be is anyone with 1000 bucks can trade and make it grow. I know you couldnt teach anyone to do that.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I am not different from the stop-loss-people, very conservative indeed. Where do you place your SL ? Depends on the timeframe, normal thing is the last swing high/low or strong S/R level etc. That´s the level I lurk for a pending order in opposite direction to the active order. Somehow general rule: Where the experienced trader places his SL, I have my pending order, hoping it will not get triggered. I do nothing but wait for a good setup to unlock. 5 Pips , no, maybe on a M1 chart, but I don´t trade M1 anymore. I prefer H1 und higher. Waiting is the main thing in lock-unlock. Actually it is very very boring because every 4 hours or every day I look on the chart only to see that there is not yet a good setup. The normal trader on H4 has the same problem - or advantage, depending from what viewpoint you judge it. That´s why I watch at least 16 pairs with my dashboard. I need entries, I am hungry for entries. It all depends on what the market is doing. Can take 2 days or 1 week until there is a good setup where I close one of those orders in profit. Can be the initial one or the hedge order, that depends on price action. On M15 this would be faster. There is a commercial method I have on my harddrive (Forex Power Strategy or something like that). That guy trades on M5 and M15 with Bollinger Bands and Stoch and Reversal candle patterns. He makes 8 - 20 % daily. Amazing. Simple but effective. He is a stop-loss-believer. I could trade his method with lock-unlock too and probably will, but right now I don´t have the time, it is too fast and since I am writing books here on the forum, I have no time left for proper trading because of all the naysayers. Not really, because I could just ignore them, it is my decision. I sometimes like to question strongholds of false belief-patterns. I treat a hedge like a failed setup on which I don´t take the loss and move on, but I make a breakeven or profit on the failed setup. It is something like "oh no, another jerk. Why can´t I only take those setups which run straight to the TP ? Ok, I will analyze the thing and accept that nobody can only take profitable setups. And now I will make the best out of it and enjoy the guaranteed breakeven or profit and move on. Enough new setups for me all over the place. As long as my money-management allows it, I will trade each new setup as it is the very first setup I find. Therefore it can happen that I close my profitable leg there and open a new position there which points to the level where my floating-loss-order is sitting. Those who don´t understand the concept will say: You are averaging now, don´t you ? I say: No, it is a new cycle. Has nothing to do with the uncompleted other cycle. I hope you understand that I think in cycles. A completed cycle can be 1 trade which hits TP or 2 trades (opposite direction) where 1 is closed in profit or zero and the other is closed in loss or zero or profit and the overall result is a breakeven or a profit. Ok , I got a chart here. GBPJPY on H4. Should I unlock ? A very strong Demand level is reached. Price could break it downwards, who knows ? Or could bounce off and run up in the channel again. Who knows ? Sam Seiden would buy, right ? Or not ? And place SL below the strong level. So I could just speculate that price will move up again. In that case I would close the Short in profit and wait and place my pending short below the area. Or I could just wait for confirmation, for a real break and wait for a definite trend reversal upwards and unlock there. Or just let it do its thing, maybe placing a TP for the Short somewhere around its Open Price in case price wants to test the high of the channel again. I´ll tell you what I do - but this is not a rule or the right thing to do. I just wait. There is a triple top on the chart. And the Support is being tested the fourth time. To me it looks like it will break through the support, but I am not a fortune teller. I absolutely don´t know where price will go. Who does ? I wait for the breakthrough and let my short run and keep the long open. Maybe others have better ideas or know what price will do ... I just wait ... For those who say: Oh, this is too boring, it is too much work and speculating, I say: Then take your loss and speculate where you can enter to recover from your loss. We both speculate, right ?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hmm, interesting indeed. So let me see if i understand, eg. My opposite-trade(lock) gets activated, moves 30 pipps in the direction of the lock and stalls. It does not seem to me as a good set-up to unlock. However, prices reverses and goes in favor of the original trade. Lock trade is now -40 pips while the original position is +20pips. What do you do now? As in your pic above you would leave the lock trade open and let the original trade run, right? If price does manage to penetrate would you increase your sell position(with a lock trade attached in case)? Besides this, i trade the 15TF and sometimes the 1hrTF. I guess this works well with these too? And how much time did it take you to become consistent with this MM method?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
It is impossible to give general rules. Depends on the timeframe, on SR-levels, on Fib-levels etc. I don´t increase any of my positions. It will be either 1 position which ends in TP or BE or somewhere I close it in profit or 2 positions. I don´t add to any of these. Took me only 1 day. ( + 6 years experience in forex ) Favorite locks-unlocks on M15 if I remember correctly. It is possible but only for those who mastered it.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
95 % of all traders dream about such a growth but only lose. I admit that prefer lock-unlock because I can start with higher risk but your method(s) certainly are great.

Tkx a lot for your help. This is definitely worth a try, to replace my recovery method. I will start trying it on a demo a/c.

If you mastered the method timeframe doesn't matter. Of course I can unlock the M15 lock faster than somebody unlocks H4 lock.

Well said. However, the vast majority of aspiring traders blow accounts and give up long before they ever find the truth. Martingales, grids and the like are particularly sadistic masters because their recovery mechanisms can keep a trader profitable for several months, giving a false sense of achievement, before the big sting inevitably occurs. I know a martingale-based EA that returned more than 4,200% profit over 14 months and 112 consecutive winning sequences of trades; and then suddenly and unexpectedly caused irretrievable drawdown in less than a single day. The real irony was that the EA also included the makings of a half-decent trading strategy, but the martingale did it in. There's only one way to win at forex and that's to be net long when price is rising and net short when price is falling, frequently enough to overcome costs. That's such a simple and obviously bulletproof mathematical truth, yet folk will try to move heaven and earth to find a MM-based shortcut that somehow circumvents it, and despite the fact that the forex scrapheap is littered with all those before them who've tried to do likewise. "But if I just keep on trying to add 2+2 in enough different ways, and think far enough outside of the box, I'll eventually find a way of getting it to equal 5......." Net long while price is rising and net short while it's falling. Hence an edge can only ever be derived from understanding and exploiting the hows and whys of price behavior. Is this an arrogant post? Maybe. But negative? NO WAY. It's VERY possible to make handsome returns from forex. But like you say, there's no point in attempting to argue with those whose minds are stubbornly focused in completely the wrong direction.

3 Weeks is way too narrow a time view, to say that your system compensates for market fluctuation over time. Maybe your system works since you are in a uptrend for period of time. So please in 10 years time come back and tell that the system works still or make a 1 year back test on your system just for fun.

You obviously don´t understand locking-unlocking. How come ? Proven wrong. A correct statement looks like this: Net profit continually is the key to profitable trading. No, but partially based on wrong assumptions. Unfortunately this is true, therefore they have to fabricate "arguments" and ignore the facts. Or making statements based on wrong assumptions. Sorry, hanover, this is not negative nor arrogant. No way. And I take this chance to express my respect and appreciation for your tremendous work and expertise. Nobody is perfect, we don´t need to adore humans, so please don´t feel offended by my posting.

Every time you’re ‘locked’, you have equally balanced long and short positions open. Correct? In terms of P/L, how is that different from being out of the market altogether? (apart from the fact that the locked positions will incur negative aggregated swap, if open at 5pm New York time; while being out of the market doesn’t). Now whenever you unlock, you leave yourself either net long or net short, yes? How is that different from my simply opening a long or short position, at the same price, at the same moment? Then if/when you choose to lock by opening an opposite position again, I simply close my position. Now we’re both net flat, and back to the starting point. Exactly the same principle applies if you lock rather than close out a losing position. Both methods achieve exactly the same goal, i.e. return the account to a net flat situation. The fact is that every hedged position can be replicated by an unhedged net position, at every point along the way. This is the crux of the matter, and I respectfully challenge anybody to create a hypothetical trading scenario that proves otherwise . Otherwise hedging (or locking/unlocking) is not really a strategy; it is merely an alternative (and, given my point about swap, a possibly slightly more expensive) way of handling the placement of orders. I’m not doubting that you’re profitable. But your profit is due entirely to your timing as to exactly when you lock and unlock your positions. The more accurately you adjust your position these relative to price reversals, the more pips you’ll bank. No matter how you stack it, profit is all about being net long when price is rising, and net short when it’s falling. Hedging is not in itself a strategy, but it might be the most convenient way of implementing a given strategy. You make claims like "proven wrong" and "based on wrong assumptions", but then offer nothing in the way of explanation, making constructive discussion impossible. Thanks for your comment about appreciation and respect, but I'd prefer an explanation as to WHY I'm wrong, in this instance.

Yes. Ok. You closed at SL with - 1 % . I have a floating loss of - 1 % . If we neglect the swap (because I will always earn more than paying in a cycle), our position is completely different because a floating loss is not a realized loss. You agree ? Yes. Since I only unlock at a reasonable level where you would enter the market too, we both would go Short (if my open order is Long). That looks like there is no difference, but let us see if that observation is correct or not. Locking again would be at the level of your SL. Price would go against your position and you would have - 2 % loss. At your SL my pending Long would trigger and I would be - 2 % floating loss. You have - 2 % realized loss. I have a - 2 % floating loss. You assume that a not realized loss is equal to a realized loss. But it is not equal. A realized loss is final. A floating loss is only a possibility. It can become a profit, a breakeven or a loss. And you assume that I don´t enter Short where I unlock and thus start a second cycle which is separate from the first. But I will enter Short there. Thus I will end up with 2 lock-cycles = 4 open positions at the level where you accept your second loss. My PL on cycle 1 is then - 2 % My PL on cycle 2 is then - 1 % You have a realized loss of 2 % and since I come out at least at breakeven in the worst case, my realized loss when both cycles end will be 0 = zero = 0 % loss. And that is the whole essence of lock-unlock. Mathematically from my viewpoint a 0 % loss is different from a 2 % loss. No. I end at breakeven in the worst case while you end in realized loss. That is not the same goal, it makes a big difference. I just did. Yes. It is an alternative ( and I have to earn the swap too, and it is not a problem). We both can only profit longterm if our timing for entries and exits is good. Lock-Unlock will yield more profits if we both take the same entries and have the same SL-levels. Ok, profit is all about coming out with more profits than losses on a continuous basis. I think we both can live with that.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
That's the whole point!!! Timing is the whole point! The Forex trading is all about timing! But nobody is perfect! If I made a mistake and entered at the wrong time - locking gives me an opportunity to fix this mistake with unlocking at the right time! If the stop-loss guy enters at the wrong time - that's it! He doesn't have the opportunity to fix it, he just loses his money!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Exactly. The locker will make much more profits than the loss-taker given that they trade the same setups with same entry, SL and TP levels.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Yes, those "small" stop-losses, 1.5% here, 2% there - sum up to a very substantial amount! Plus the locker can get profit where the loss-taker just loses.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
OK, many thanks for the explanation — now I see at least one important point where we differ. I do not see how a floating loss differs from a realized loss. You can close a floating loss and immediately re-open the same size position. Of course it would be silly to do so, because you'd incur extra spread, but if it wasn't for this spread, your net position (P/L, dollar-wise) would be exactly the same. Hence there's no mathematical difference. You say " A floating loss is only a possibility. It can become a profit, a breakeven or a loss ". But everything else being equal, a floating loss has a 50/50 chance of getting smaller or bigger , because (to state the obvious) price can either move in your favor, or against you. Unless you're able to forecast which way (on balance of probability), then keeping the position floating has no benefit over closing it. And if my trading skills allow me to make that same forecast, I could simply open the same size position, and capture that same profit. IMO the assumption that a floating loss is harmless until a trade is closed involves similar (and I believe erroneous) logic to saying that if I only ever close trades when they are in profit then I'm guaranteed a 100% win rate. I don't fully understand how your "cycles" work, but it sounds like you don't end a cycle until its component trades break even overall. But doesn't that mean that you now possibly have a floating loss elsewhere to contend with? How is that not effectively merely exchanging one loss for another? If that's the case, then I'm afraid I must remain skeptical. The way your br0ker sees it, your actual account equity includes floating losses. Hence if you had $8000 balance in closed trades, and a $2000 floating loss, you have only $6000 available to you. It seems to me that you're counting on that $2000 returning to breakeven, but the reality is that anything could happen. And if you were to ever hit a margin call, your floating losses suddenly become very real. The way I see it, whatever has happened up until this point in a trade (or group of open trades) is irrelevant, because you can't change the past. Regardless of whether you're net long or short, or whatever your P/L is, the market will do as it pleases henceforth . If the probabilities say it's more likely to rise, or fall, then your trading decision now should reflect that. And if you you can't determine this, and you decide to keep the trade(s) open, then you have a 50/50 chance of your overall bottom line (which is all that really matters) improving, or worsening. If I'm missing something, I'm sorry, but it's 3:00am here in NZ and I'm tired. I don't fully understand how your "cycles" work. All I can say is that I've tested many, many, many MM systems and have found no advantage in any kind of hedging. There are only three possibilities — net long, net short or net flat — I can't see how any MM, or order placement system, can circumvent that.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Assuming that I understand the locking correctly, then I still have to disagree. The crux of the matter is whether a floating loss is the same as a realized loss. Your floating loss, or "opportunity to fix the mistake", has a 50/50 probability of going the other way — plunging you into even deeper loss. What do you do then? Apply another lock/unlock, and open up the same 50/50 probability of going even further into drawdown? The way I see it, you're simply offsetting one loss with another, until you finally get the timing right. And getting the timing right is the same problem facing the trader who uses 'conventional' MM. I have explained these reasons in greater detail in my reply to fxtr51.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
hanover, are you under the impression that the lockers risk 10-20-25% per trade? It is not martingale, we lock the price with the same lot size we opened the original trade, and I can assure you that lockers usually risk the same (or even less) percentage the stop-loss guys risk.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
No, I see it exactly like fxtr51 sees it, and I don't think I will change my point of view and I don't think you will change your point of view. hanover, go get some sleep, tomorrow will be another day! And tomorrow you will be able to argue with fxtr51 being in the better shape than right now, at 3:30 AM NZ-time!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I would be interested in what makes you unlock, what are the system requirements. For example I could use my 10.0 theory as points to unlock, if you are familiar with it. Obviously you have a point you believe the market is changing direction. I understand the success of your system rides on the ability to know when to unlock and change directions. Just wondered what that was based on.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
nanningbob, in my case we're talking about recovering 20-25 pips, 30 pips tops, and I trade mostly M1, M5 and M15, so I don't need a special theory about that and I don't need a huge turning point either. When I see a very good signal (I mean the system I trade' signal) in the direction I need - I unlock. It sounds very simple, but it works.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Yes, Favorite wrapped it up. The place to unlock is just a good signal from whatever system you use which gives good entries with high probability, exactly where a loss-taker would enter too. Nothing special about it. I will change to M15 for sure and M5 because I see the same patterns there. Right now I don´t have the time, so I trade on H4 , that boring timeframe. For 2 years I traded hedging, but with SL on both orders and doubling lot-sizes. Martingale. Oh yes, I know a lot about that. Made 3 - 10 % daily on my live-accounts with it. Doubled my account a few times. But guess what ? One bad setup ... and there is no escape, it will happen ... and price whipsawed on me .... bang, margin call. I know all about hedging the wrong way and martingale and margin calls. I paid a big price to learn the lessons. Will never do it again. Lock-Unlock is different. No martingale. 2 or 3 wrong unlocks maximum, most of the time no lock at all because TP is hit without triggering the pending order. I could trade this easily with 3 or 5 % initial risk but I don´t because 1 % is enough. Plenty of signals, plenty of profits for me with 1 %.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
This strategy will never work, I tested several EAs without SL, show only an illusion of profits, when the program is forced to stop due to lack of money or other reason, you may see an even bigger loss than gains over time.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
when hanover is sleeping, i show some support here to him first, let me use an analogy: tom is a great trader, he has been profitable for two years. every morning, he smokes 1 box of cigar, feeling great, then go trading, and winning. he concludes " smoking 1 box of cigar is my key of success ". then he keeps doing that, and he keeps winning in trading. it is okay that tom does his trading in that way: smoking a box of cigars, then trade. it is NOT okay that tom tell the other folks " smoke and trade, you will win. it is the key to trading ." second, i can guess why fxtr and favourite support NO-SL, since i've been there before. they think that they can have "another chance" to save the wrong position. and this "another chance" may show up several times, and they can take the correct direction in at least for once to exit with profit/BE. this thought is NOT right in math. we all know that you toss a coin, even if you've tossed 100 head-up, for the 101st toss, your chance of head-up is still 50%. similarly, if you enter a pos, it goes into DD, at this point, you decide to lock, your winning probability is same as SL and enter another opposite pos. As to the p/l thing, hanover has said all. now i actually believe that fxtr and favourate are profitable traders. but please, you are profitable NOT because you do lock-unlock. it is simply because you know the timing. On the other hand, noobs who try to follow your lock-unlock way will doom.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
No, I'm not. Sorry if I created that impression with the numbers I used. fxtr51 was taking about floating losses of 1%-2%. So perhaps I should have said "if you had $8000 balance in closed trades, and a $10 floating loss, you have only $7990 available to you". But the principle involved — that the amount available includes the floating loss(es) — remains the same. The point of difference in our respective ways of thinking is the way in which floating losses are viewed. I see money lost to date in a trade as being tangible, while fxtr51 sees it as a " possibility that can become a profit, a breakeven or a loss ", and you likewise see it as " an opportunity to fix the mistake ". I don't fully understand the nuances of locking/unlocking, but I don't need to, now that I see the underlying reason for the opposing points of view. In terms of furthering the discussion, I can't present my case any more clearly, or any differently, than what I have done (but I will have one final attempt — see below). I will simply end up repeating myself. Unless somebody can show me how or why floating losses are intangible, then I'm afraid I can not change my position, namely that MM in itself can never provide an edge. I've had this type of discussion in many other threads, and to avoid the same misunderstandings, I'd like to make one point doubly clear. Do I believe that it's possible to be profitable using hedging and/or locking? ABSOLUTELY YES. It's just that I believe that the edge does not come from the MM. It comes from the skill in timing. It is obvious to me that if the locking was applied at different times/prices, the P/L would be different. _________________________ To illustrate this, here’s a fully annotated example. It might not use the same kind of locking that you guys use, but I believe the principles involved are exactly the same. Let’s assume that we have 2 traders, Mr L , who uses a form of locking; and Mr M , who uses 'conventional' MM. Price follows the line shown in the attached image, from A to B to C to D. The distance from A to P is 60 pips, P to B is another 20 pips, B to C is a retracement of 30 pips, and C to D is 70 pips. Sketch a diagram for yourself, and work through the following scenarios. Scenario #1 : Both L and M buy 1 lot at point A. Price rises to B, at which point L locks in his profit by opening a 1 lot sell, while M simply closes his position. Both are +80 pips, but L has a floating profit on one trade, while M has realized his 80 pips. (You would say that L, who has a floating position at this point in time, has better opportunities than M, right? I’ll address this point later**). Price then retraces from B to C. L has now two open trades, a buy at +50 pips and a sell at +30. M still has +80 pips in the bank. Now both traders correctly forecast that price will rise from point C. Hence L unlocks by closing his sell, banking his +30, while M simply opens a buy position of 1 lot. Now both traders are net long 1 lot. Price rises from C to D, causing a gain of +70 pips. Both traders close their positions. OK, now who is the more profitable? M has netted +80 and +70 from two buy trades, for a total of +150 . L’s buy, which was open the whole time, has netted +120, plus +30 from his sell, for a total of +150 , exactly the same. So did the locking provide any added profit? No. Scenario #2 : Again, both L and M buy 1 lot at point A. Now this time their forecasting is not perfect. Both believe that price will turn downward at P. Hence M banks +60 at this point, and L locks his buy with a sell, just as before. Price moves to B. Now M has +60 in the bank, while L has +80 and –20 in open trades. Price moves to C. Now L has +50 and +10 in open trades, while M’s account balance remains unchanged. Now everything proceeds just as in scenario #1 from this point. L unlocks by closing his sell, banking his +10, while M simply opens a buy position of 1 lot. Now both traders are net long 1 lot. Price rises from C to D, causing a gain of +70 pips. Both traders close their positions. This time, L has netted +120 from a buy trade, and +10 from a sell trade, for a total of +130 . M has netted +60 and +70, likewise for a total of +130 . So did the locking provide any added benefit? Again, no. Now why did both traders made +150 in scenario #1, but only +130 in scenario #2? The answer is more accurate forecasting and timing. In #1, they forecasted turns at A, B, C and D, and nailed them perfectly. In #2, they were wrong by forecasting a turn at P, which didn’t eventuate until B. Hence their forecasts were inaccurate by 20 pips, and that 20 pips is the difference between +150 and +130. Both traders made equal profit in each scenario because they made their decisions to adjust their positions at the same time . Both were net long and net flat at identical times. The locking merely amounted to different ways of placing the orders, nothing more. **Finally, let’s address the point about opportunity. At the exact moment price reaches point B in scenario #1, L has an open buy position, while M is out of the market. Let’s freeze time at this point. Depending on whether price rises or falls from B, L has a 50/50 probability of increasing or decreasing his floating +80 at this point. I would argue that — from the standpoint of mathematical expectancy — L is neither better nor worse off than M, because 50% of the time he will be right and outperform M, and 50% of the time he will be wrong, and will underperform M. However strange it might seem, t he opportunity is therefore the same for both traders. But, you might ask, what if L gets the direction right more than 50% of the time? Well, then he will benefit from his forecasting expertise, but not from the locking/unlocking. And if M is equally skilled, he can simply open a buy trade at that same instant and his P/L will be exactly the same. It would also make no difference (apart from incurring additional spread) if L closed his +80, and then immediately opened a new buy position. The prior P/L is of no consequence to what happens henceforth; the new position will stand or fall on its own merit, increasing or decreasing bottom line in exactly the same way as if the former position was simply kept open. Exactly the same logic applies if you attempt to use locking to recover from a –80 position. I'm not sure that I understand your "cycles" concept, but merely grouping trades into different "cycles" is not going to change the overall net P/L. Each position contributes to eventual bottom line, no matter how recent wins and losses, or floating and realized positions, are grouped. Conclusion : It’s the timing that determines P/L. The number of pips banked equates to how accurately you’re net long when price is rising, and net short when it’s falling, relative to turns in the market. Hedging or locking in itself does not add any value, and does not create opportunities that the conventional trader can not replicate by simply adding new positions at the identical time. You guys might use locking/unlocking differently to this. You can change the distances between A, B, C, and D, and even create more complex scenarios, or use percentages or dollars instead of pips, but I contend that the principles remain exactly the same.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
hanover, as I said before, whatever we say, we can't change each other's point of view. Sorry, but I just can't add anything to what fxtr51 and I already said. However I agree that the skill in timing is the most important part of the locking.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Yes, but you see: if fxtr51 and I were stop-loss guys, we still would be profitable, but we would be less profitable than we as the lockers. Absolutely!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Guys, you know what? It is Nacho's thread, everything started with his system. We explained everything about our methods, and now let him choose what he wants to use: Recovery, Locking, Stop-losses or No-Stop-Loss. And if he chooses Locking, I'm sure fxtr51 and I will be able to help him.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
OK understand, recovery of 25-30 pips would be simple if you use the next trading signal. I assume you could trade large lot sizes then and go for the big kill at times. It is interesting to see, and I respect Hanover a lot, that multiple trades considered as a single unit seems to mystify some. In a sense that is the real debate over certain trading methods. They will add positions to a winning trade, using their same arguments and lose all their profit. Meanwhile you can add positions and wipe out a loss also. Like last fall with the EURO, no matter what price action did you could do a sell and just wait for it to become profitable. The fundamentals were just on your side if you were patient with the trade. Multiple trades and levels just does not compute being considered a single unit, I understand how it works, some just dont. The one truth in Forex that is always 100% true, what goes up must come down and what goes down must come up. Doesnt mean you have to come back to point of origin, but you do have places you can recover. Good luck with your trading.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I think the real problem is that most traders, or aspiring traders for that matter are not willing to invest the time that it really takes to study. You should only approach any of these techniques after understanding all of the underlying concepts. The most profitable trading is always discretionary trading. That is what hedging/locking etc falls into. Most new traders, and then many others just want to make a stable profit. Even if that means you are doing 70/30% or less. For some even better if they could simply write an EA, that is all they want. This is a problem for many to understand here. This technique is based on a deeper understanding of the market, with cycles and price action. This can be a real problem for most novice traders, and for many seasoned ones as well. "After all why invest 25 hours per day if you can only 8 ? , and still make a good living". but... for any novice who tries, the reward is great, since in order to achieve success you simply have to learn a wealth of information about the markets and what it is that actually moves them.

Charvo, I know how you feel. It's really frustrating when you can see something so clearly, but can't explain it in a way that others can follow it. LazyPawn is right; I guess I'm foolish to participate in these types of thread, because they invariably end in an impasse, with both parties believing, in all sincerity, that they can see something that the other party can't. I have a friend who claims that he has a system that can improve his odds of winning the lottery. Actually, all he's doing is applying gambler's fallacy (just as in your coin toss example). I've tried to explain this fallacy to him many times, but the problem is that he frequently wins decent sums of money. Math professors would agree unhesitatingly that he's merely lucky, but he has results that appear to prove his illusion. You'll never convince him otherwise. People will believe whatever they want to believe; so long as something works profitably, they have no reason to ask questions WHY . Anyway, I'm going to smoke a cigar now, before I place my next trade. David

If one has the common sense to accept the obvious mathematical truth it becomes clear that if 2 traders "read" the market exactly the same way, opening their positions exactly at the same point, using the same lot size ... the one using lock-unlock will end up getting at best the same profit as the one using the standard stop loss method. In fact he would fare a little worse given the higher trading costs. It's an inescapable mathematical truth, and hanover did a great job of proving it for those who had doubts. However we cannot ignore the psychological issues involved. We are not machines and too often let our emotions take over. For some people closing a position as a loss hurts a lot. They accept doing it only if at the same time they close another one for a bigger profit, to get a net profit that day. If such people were forced to use the simple SL method they would fail because they would be too often tempted to do foolish things (like moving their SL, increasing their bet size, revenge trading and so on). So for this type of trader I suppose that hedging works better. For other traders like myself there is absolutely no pain in having a 1% loss today and a 2% win tomorrow. Such traders have accepted losses as part of the job and they know they have a sound strategy that wins overall. To this kind of trader having multiple positions open at the same time, especially on the same pair, and in opposite directions, is a much bigger stress or mental torture. So they couldn't do a proper hedging for psychological reasons, just as the no SL guys would probably fail trying to use SL. My personal conclusion regarding the lock-unlock vs. SL discussion is that even if overall the SL method of trading is mathematically superior (by a very small margin), from a practical point of view each trader should choose the method that allows him to trade emotion-free and sleep well at night. Eventually it's still the trading skills themselves that decide the outcome and not some MM gimmick.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
If anything Hanover, I was on the fence thinking "I've an idea what this guy is on about, but wouldn't it just double the spread?" and you perfectly articulated what exactly is wrong about this kind of hedging.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Lazy Pawn: -1 , -1 , -1, -1 , +1 = - 3 % 0, 0, 0 , 0 , + 1 = + 1 % For you it is the inescapable mathematical truth that - 3 % is equal to + 1 % For me - 3 % is not equal to + 1 % . And even if the brightest mathematician on earth would try to convince me that they are equal, I would never ever believe him. How many times must this obvious fact be repeated until it finds its way into the mind or brain or whatever you like to call that thing which is doing the thinking and reasoning ?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
fxtr51, Please provide a chart, or a drawing like hanover did a few posts above. Then show on that chart how the lock-unlock method wins more, if both traders read the market exactly the same way . Simply typing that you make x% has no meaning. Show it on a diagram and we'll see what you fail to understand.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Bob, we've had some great discussions, and the respect is mutual. My problem here is that (A+B)+C = A+(B+C) = (A+C)+B. If A, B and C represent the P/L of individual trades, it doesn't matter how I group them, my overall bottom line is still the same. Hence I don't see how the grouping provides an advantage; I'm afraid I belong to the "mystified" club. David

I explained it in great detail, more than once, posted charts and explained it again. But it is obvious that some don´t bother to read. And from some who read, some don´t understand what they read. Sorry, I cannot and will not change the world or people. Minds do not only process information like computers do, there is more involved. Emotions like fear or envy and others. Trauma, belief systems and more of that stuff. That is just fact and we only can accept it and move on. Everybody with an open mind can go through my postings and some of those who understand the concept and get it. It makes no sense to repeat it dozens of times and then the next posting says "this will give you a margin call" or "this is crap". Let us agree on: Some get it, some not. Peace.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
We had no discussions yet but I have read some of your postings and from that I have great respect for you, hanover. That doesn´t mean that I agree on all you say. Of course your math is correct, but lock-unlock is different. It is basically - 3 % are not equal to + 1 % . Meaning that 5 setups are taken with identical SL and TP levels. 4 hit SL , 1 hits TP . The locker comes out with an overall 1 % profit. The losser comes out with an overall loss of 3 % . That is the essence in a nutshell and comparing P/L the way you do it doesn´t fit. It is the wrong method and thus gives you a wrong conclusion.

fxtr51, You posted charts showing how hedging worked for you. Great, good job. But you fail to see that reading the market in the same way and using a SL would have gained the exact same number of pips. You never compared the 2 methods, as hanover did in his diagram above. If that diagram and the explanations that go with it are not enough for you there is really nothing more that I can add. Maybe just that I'm honestly surprised to see such an excellent coder having a hard time grasping a simple mathematical model.

This is exactly the issue. People do not bother to spend the time necessary to fully understand the subject. Simply looking for EA's and automated black-box methods.

In general it's just plain stupidity: Long 1: 1.50 10 SL. Long 2: 1.50 No SL (Will hedge at 10 pips loss). Price moves to 1.40 Long 1 closes: realized loss: 10). Long 2: Price is "locked" for hedge, 10 pips unrealized loss. Price moves to 1.5 again. Long 1: 1.50 10 SL. Long 2: Hedge is "unlocked", still 10 pips unrealized loss. Price moves to 1.60. Long 1 has 10 loss, 10 profit = Breakeven. Long 2 has 10 loss (before locking at 1.40). This loss is not realized, but once you unlock at 1.50 you still have a -10 pips trade. Your trade moved to 1.60 and as such, a move of 10 pips only gives you the EXACT same result: Breakeven.

No, LazyPawn. I often compared both methods and the essence is: - 3 % is not equal to + 1 % . Sorry, but if you think both have gained the same number of Pips, then you do not understand - and hanover neither - how lock-unlock is traded. Because - 3 does not equal + 1 and that is the inevitable outcome of both methods. Pipsgeek, just read your posting. You have not understood the method, constructed a wrong example which leads you to a wrong conclusion and then you say: in general it is plain stupidity. Go figure that one...

I understand. The bottom line is I just use bigger SL which allows more trades to hit profit. As long as I can see I am following a trend or big fundamental I see no use in a SL. If I am wrong, which does happen, I take my hit and go on. Because I trade like this my win ratio hovers near 75-80%. That is what I do trend trading. Counter-trend trading or range trading, I use multiple levels and multiple entrances. These are all based on my read on the market. You know sometimes I am wrong in a trade and have to eat a loss but overall through the years I have increased my account. I guess groupings advantage is this. When you take a SL it is permanent and you have to recover that loss with a future winning trade. I do the same thing but I dont close the loss until I have winners to cover it. Then there are a couple of times I have to just take a loss like you do and make it up later. The best part is though I have losing trades you take losses on that I dont because they do turn around and later become profitable. That is my advantage.

Let's take one of your charts, ok? To the left you had a bad sell (I suppose) which you then hedged by opening a buy above it. The distance between them is the lock range. I don't see exactly how many pips it is, but let's make that 30. So ... at this point the SL trader has hit his SL, and he lost 30 pips. He has no position open. The hedging guy has a -30 floating loss. Then to the right you notice a good signal to go short and you unhedge your position by closing the long. Again I cannot count how many pips, but let's say the long is a 300 pip win, meaning that at that point your short is a 330 loss. You let the short go for 100 pips let's say. Overall you will have a 300 pip win (the long) and a 330-100 = 230 pip loss on the short. Your total PL is 70 pips. The SL guy simply opens the short at the same point, and also closes it after 100 pips. So he gained 100 pips on this trade, he has the 30 loss from the first trade. Overall: 70 pips as well. So tell me please, what is not clear with this?

Lazy, the crux of the matter is the way in which floating losses are viewed. The percentages that fxtr51 is providing don't include floating losses (fxtr51, please feel welcome to correct me if I've misunderstood). Hence he will keep locking/unlocking each "cycle" (set of trades) until the set as a whole returns to breakeven or better. Now (and assuming I've understood correctly) I see this approach to MM as illusory, but that's because I believe that floating losses should be included as part of current P/L, and for exactly the reasons that I've clearly stated. A common theme with all of these these hedging, grid, recovery, martingale variants and other MM-based systems is that they ignore floating losses, on the assumption (whether rightly or wrongly) that they can always somehow be managed back to breakeven. Bob neatly summarizes this school of thought when he says that what goes down must eventually come back up. As I said in my reply to Charvo, parties on both sides of this debate believe, in all sincerity, that they can see something that the other party can't; and that folk will believe whatever they want to believe, and continue to use methods for as long as they return profit, without having any real motivation to ask any questions why. Restating my case repeatedly is not going to make it any stronger, so I'll just say that until somebody successfully debunks the math in the annotated example that I posted, or otherwise provides a compelling enough argument, I feel very 'comfortable' maintaining my current point of view. David

Fair enough. Thanks for the explanation.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yes. Yes. This is your assumption. And it is wrong. Hence you come to wrong conclusions. I´ll tell you and then you will understand. I am sure. At the level where I close the profitable long leg, I will open the same SHORT the losser opens. Because I always said: A cycle is a cycle and has nothing to do with the new signal on which the losser will enter trying to recover his previous loss. The new signal on which the losser is entering his SHORT has 2 meanings for the locker. 1. it might be a level to unlock. 2. it might be a level to open a new trade , which in itself is a new cycle. At this level where the losser enters his SHORT hoping that he will recover his loss, the locker must not unlock necessarily and he must not enter a new cycle either. But the whole discussion is about the comparison between a locker and a losser. And the math is easy: 5 setups. 4 hit SL. 1 hits TP. Both take the same entries with 1% risk. Outcome: Losser: - 3 % Locker: + 1 % What you and hanover failed to see was the basic difference between a cycle and a losser setup. And because of your wrong assumption you always ended up in wrong conclusions. I hope I made it clear now. And sorry for bothering you: I already explained this before. Cycle does not equal a setup of a losser. If the setup hits TP without hitting SL ( what a statement LOL ), a locker-Cycle is identical, not exactly because he has to delete the pending order and both orders have no SL, but you know what I mean. If the setup is bad and the SL level is hit, the Cycle is different from the losser thing because the losser has booked the loss ( and thus has less equity for his next trade, so what "argument" is that about the equity ? ) while the locker has 2 open positions in a frozen 1 % loss . Ok, I feel you got it. Cycle != losser-setup ----&gt; all of the wonderfull arguments which led to "there is no difference" were based on wrong assumptions.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Well, the losser has a realized loss of 1 %. His balance and equity are now 1 % lower than before. The locker has a frozen 1 % P/L and thus he has 1 % less equity for new positions. What is your point then ? The spread ? I don´t care about spread because we are talking about 1% risk , meaning a 20 - 70 Pips distance to SL level. Is anybody here who has a broker who charges 20 Pips up to 70 Pips spread ? So what exactly is the point about spread ? When a locker closes a cycle at breakeven or in profit, it is exactly that: a breakeven or a profit. Spread does not matter at all because we are not talking about a distance of 1 Pip from Open to StopLoss, we are talking about 20 - 70 Pips or more. In my experience it is not illusory but real. I don´t ignore floating losses, they are part of my MM. And if you look on a H4 chart, you can find moves of 200 - 800 Pips and more in one direction all the time. And within such moves you always have pullbacks. The whole Fib trading armada lives from that fact. Therefore in every move there will be plenty of unlock levels and when I need 30 - 70 Pips to break even and the pullback is 100 - 200 Pips, I always manage to close my cycle with a breakeven or a profit. I debunked it with all due respect to you.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
again I'm drawn to these type of threads. Only coz hanover is posting Words of wisdom: Your hedge-unhedge strategy relies on a very solid and undeniable edge. Something you must 100% be sure will make you money. Hedging and unhedging the way you(fxtr51) do it assumes that your edge is impenetrable. Every time you unhedge, you are in essence placing a new trade. You are expecting that the moment you unhedge, you will start to move into profits. The flaw of logic: In the first place, if your edge is so perfect, you would never have to hedge to begin with. The fact that you have to hedge means that your edge is not 100% fool proof. So what happens if you unhedge and you are wrong? Every time you unhedge and make a wrong decision, you will fall further and further into loss. And as long as your edge is not 100% fool proof (which is impossible) Your loss will keep getting bigger. Source: My own experience.

If the "frozen 1% P/L" is a loss, then both traders are effectively down 1%. Spread? Who mentioned spread? Anyway, no matter, I agree that spread is irrelevant; and swap applies only if frozen positions are open at 1700 NY EST, and is negligible, in any case. Confirms my previous understanding as to what a "cycle" is. Perhaps "ignore" was bad choice of word on my part. But in your reply to LazyPawn, where you say: " Outcome: Losser: - 3 % Locker: + 1 % " ...... the +1% doesn't include floating or frozen losses, right? (Just trying to understand, no criticism implied). I have only one tiny problem with that. I don't see any reference to the math in my post. I have nothing further to add to my previous posts, and I don't want to repeat myself. The simple fact is that we view floating/frozen losses differently. Let's just agree to disagree. Thanks for the discussion.

Sorry Nachos it is unfair for us to hijack your thread with an old debate.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
FF owes you a free thread after the mods binned your previous one. Let's hope we don't get into aliens or religion this time around. I promise I'll stay on topic....... but I'm virtually done here, anyway. And as Bob points out, we've hijacked Nachos' thread. But, whatever their merit, the opinions about locking/hedging are an extension of the no-SL strategy that Nachos started the thread with, hence the discussion is arguably not totally irrelevant.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
My question is this. Why is this different than what you do? He says he hedges at around -30, let us say you SL at -30. When you trade a position again you need to over come the -30, when he unhedges he needs to overcome the -30. Yes he could lose another 30 but so could you. The advantage he has is his original -30 could become a profit trade again while your -30 is permanent. So he gains an advantage by not making his -30 permanent. He has a chance that both trades will become profitable and also both trades becoming losers. You only have one chance at the present trade becoming profitable and a chance at both becoming losers. I see his logic both the dangers and the upside. I think he does too. You argue only that his loss can only get bigger but his position is a double edged sword, his profit can get bigger also and end up with no losing trade. In a sense I see this as no different than entering into a winning position with multiple trades. (Just to drive you guys crazy that will be my next trading update, when and where to add to a winning position. I multi-level when I am down, now I will try to multi-level going into profit also.)

--- 帖子 #153 ---
The biggest difference is that there might be a chance that price will NEVER return . Meaning, you may never recover. What you are doing is a double edged sword. By allowing price to "return", you are also taking a risk to allow price to "never return". The deal breaker is this: Unlike stop loss people, whose losses are fixed, you nedgers have an unlimited risk of loss. We all fear the black swan. Apparently you don't. Maybe you have never been in that situation before. But I have. And it was back in the 2008 crisis. Heck, you don't even need a crisis. Just look at shanghai surprise. Many people died on those random days. The more recent ones are the chf intervention. Imagine if you were caught on the wrong side of the trade. The only reason you need to nedge like this is if you feel that you cannot trust your edge enough. That means you need to substitute money management for an edge - something that hanover has mentioned many times that it will inevitably fail. If you are confident in your edge, it makes sense to have a SL so that you limit the risk exposure . For example: My strategy allows me to win 3% when i am right and lose 1% when I am wrong. Yes, I do lose on a consistant basis. But I only need a few wins to pull ahead. That way my risk is always limited and it takes many losses to put me in the -ve. I am in no risk of ever losing more than I bargained for. On the contrary, when you nurture floating losses, you run the risk of losing more than you bargained for. If you need to exit a trade after a certain drawdown, why not exit now? Let's use bob's words for a while. He says that at some point, he will exit a trade when he thinks it is beyond doubt that he needs to take a loss. In between he would be hedging in and out hoping that the price will come back and break even for him. The better solution would be to just use a very huge stop loss. You don't need to hedge, you don't need to add positions. It achieves the same thing. If price eventually goes back to breakeven, then you never had to hedge in the first place. But if price never goes back, your loss if fixed. Of course, this method implies bad risk:reward ratios. But then that is another discussion. Summary: 1)hedging allows you a chance to recover but also introduces an unlimited risk situation. 2)stop losses will always make you have a controlled loss.

No Bob you do not multi-level when you are down you Martingale. Why cant you call it what it is? This thread is nonsense. NO professional trader making their living from the markets trades this way. NO ONE. Pull up your panties girls....

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I am not a hedger (nedger LOL term) I cant use, USA broker. You miss all the trades that are profitable. There are more than them than the occasional loser. Black swan events dont affect how I trade ........... forget it we have been through this all before.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I believe we have... If you can't hedge, then you are in even worse shape because you are averaging losses. I sincerely hope that one day you will be successful enough to come out and publish a book on how you made it big with your methods. By that time, it will be undeniable that you were right and we were wrong. But as history has shown us for the past few hundred years, stop losses work. Averaging losses don't. Until you can prove the many paul tudor jones of the past wrong, the burden of proof is on your shoulders.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Is it not something like this? -1, +1, -1, +1, +1 = 1% (-1), 0, (-1), 0, +1 = 1% within parenthesis are floating loss.

I think you missed my short review a couple of posts ago. I did trade and post every trade here at FF for a year. Not an issue of right or wrong. I trade differently from the leveraged high lot formula with a low leverage, low lot formula. It is very conflicting styles. Enjoyed your thread.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Like I said bob, I sincerely hope you will be able to publish your methods one day. I know I will pick up the book if you ever publish it. But till that day, I will have to wait and see. You and I both know that 1 year of trading history does not warrant enough results to conclusively come to an agreement. edit: And yes... that thread... I was kinda glad it got binned . Though I wish the meaningful discussions could have been kept somewhere. That is a thread of very powerful discussions.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
fxtr51, if you hedged a 30 pip loss and undo the hedge at an excellent spot and price goes in your favour for 30 pips, you`re at BE. same for the SL guy who lost 30 pips when you hedged and placed the same trade at that excellent spot is also at BE. I can only see you getting ahead of the SL guy if you unhedge at that excellent spot, but also place another order at that time. only then would you be ahead with a 30 pip win.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
The frozen 1% P/L has an effect because there is 1% less equity available for new trades. The losser has 1% realized loss and thus has 1 % less equity available for new trades. But a floating loss is not equal to a realized loss. In fact it is completely different. How can this be explained ? I once was in stocks. They were "worth" 500k (was in DM times long before the stupid and idiotic Euro was invented by NewWorldOrder criminals). They were rising and the same amount of stocks were 600k. Did I have earned 100k ? Then market dropped and the stocks were only 300k "worth". I hold them. Did I lose 200k ? Or even 300k relative to the all time high ? What do you think ? Is a floating loss equal to a realized loss ? When I read your postings, I have the impression that you are trying to convince me that they are equal. So I waited some more with my stocks until I trusted the advice of the year 2000 doomsday ( all computers will stop working correctly, the world will fall into stone age ) and I sold my stocks for 500 k. My net profit was zero. the year 2000 came and the lights still did burn after midnight. And the stocks saw a rally. My stocks would have rallied to 1 million. But I was invested in real estate instead. Missed the rally because I sold on a rumor. Do you still believe that a floating loss or floating profit is equal to a realized loss or profit ? Then every word more is futile, hanover. The + 1 % is after the close of all positions. All cycles are finished. I am not in the market. The losser has closed his 5 positions too and is not in the market. In that situation the +1% do not include frozen floating losses, there is no open position at all. Your math has no relevance to lock-unlock and the problem is that some - and maybe you too - assume that you "proved" that lock-unlock does not work. Then they come and say: hanover proved that lock-unlock does not work and is stupid. I say: They don´t understand lock-unlock in the first place and thus they fall into the trap that you just "proved" that lock-unlock is nonsense. I don´t know how to see a floating loss as being equal to a realized loss. My stock market example proves that they are not equal. If you still insist that they are equal, there is nothing to discuss anymore. I would if I understood what you are trying to say. But I don´t get it because I don´t understand why a math not related to what lock-unlock is should "prove" something. I don´t get your point, hanover.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yes, that is the whole point and if we compare lossing and locking I will place another order when I unlock because the unlock is a different cycle and has nothing to do with the new order. This way I will be getting ahead of the SL over time without any doubts because nobody has a 100 % win rate. That fact is getting me ahead. Basically the math is easy and it is very hard to understand that some don´t get it: For each loss a losser has, I get to breakeven or make a profit. For each winner I make a winner too. Now figure out who will be ahead. And I explained it a dozen times but I know what happens with such threads. Nobody (maybe a few) read the old postings and things which have been explained a dozen times are asked again. Therefore I let it rest. Those who still come and say "crap" and "nonsense" only demonstrate that they have not read or did not understand . So what ? Let them keep their illusions , who bothers ? Goodbye and thanks to those who discussed in a sober and non-offending manner.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Then you have 2 lots short. It simply means that you trust that signal a lot. That will increase both your potential risk for loss and your potential gain. It is no different than the SL guy opening his short at the exact same spot with twice the usual size. If you close your shorts after 100 pips in my example you have the 300 pip gain plus the 100 pip gain plus the -230 floating loss. Total 170 pips. The SL guy has the 30 pip loss plus 2x100 pips gain which is also 170. If you want to follow the 2 kinds of traders on any kind of chart, you will have to give them the same credit. I give you a very simple list to see the equivalent of what the SL guy does. In our common chart example if you simply follow the table you will see that when you close your long leg of the hedge, that is equivalent to the opening of a short by the SL guy. If you open a new short at that same spot, that is also equivalent to opening a short by the SL guy. That is how he ends up with twice the size of the short at the same spot and you both have the same profits. Please feel free to follow the logic you find in that table for any chart and you will see that the outcome is always the same for the 2 kinds of traders. Hanover was right, it seems to me that you never count the floating loss and that's why you imagine that you are ahead. So if you have banked 1000 pips and have a -600 floating loss you count this as 1000. The traditional MM guy has no position open, just a 400 pip gain, and you say that 1000 is bigger than 400. You fail to realize that at some point you will have to close those floating points and what you get is exactly the same. You think that you would unhedge at great spots until those floating losses become all wins, which is possible, but you refuse to give the SL trader the skills to open fresh positions at the same point and make the same profits. You give us the example of stocks initially worth 500k, then assume the SL trader would have liquidated them when they were worth just 300k for a loss, while you kept them until they got back to 500k and didn't lose a penny. That's comparing apple with oranges. The discussion is about hedging vs. SL at exactly the same point. If I buy at 500 and sell at 300 I lost 200. If you buy at 500, open a short at 300 to hedge, then when you get back to 500 you have zero positions closed but 2 positions open - one of them is BE, the other one is -200. Same outcome.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I think the point the non-believers in lock/unlock are missing is that risk is being limited to the locked range This is not the same as having no SL, far from it If the locked range is 100, and the price moves a further 1,000 pips the "loss" (unrealized) is still only 100 pips (one losing trade of 1,100 pips and one winning trade of 1,000 pips) This is not the same as trading with no SL, those who trade with no SL and do not hedge will have a floating loss of 1,100 pips There are 3 distinct groups here (stop-lossers, hedgers, and neither) Andy

--- 帖子 #165 ---
All you are doing is twisting the scenario to make it fit to your desired "equal outcome". I thought I would not post again in this thread but since you are twisting the rules and thus you compare apples to oranges and then you blame me for doing that, I cannot let this stand uncommented. Since you now understand that I will not only unlock but open the same Short and therefore I will be ahead , you invent a martingale style of the losser. He has to double his risk to get the same outcome the locker will have. But the comparison does not allow Martingale trading. Without breaking the rules for a correct comparison, you realize that the losser will never make the same profits the locker does. Why are you trying so hard to twist the rules and to compare apples with oranges ? And even on that you are wrong. Because your losser will now lose 2 % if price goes against his Short and hits SL. He will now be at -1% , - 2% = total of 3 % realized loss in his account. While the locker will have a frozen floating loss of -3% . Next setup, the losser must enter with a 3 % risk to get even and if he was wrong again, he is now at 6 % loss in his account. He is on his way to the margin call while the locker is not because the locker does not martingale. All of his positions are the initial 1 % risk and if you bother to look at a chart, you will see that the locker will work his way out of the floating loss to a breakeven or profit while the losser has emptied half of his account with his martingale nonsense. The structure of the market is obvious. There will be levels where the unlock will bring me breakeven or a profit on a cycle even if I unlock several times at a bad level and have to lock again. The martingale losser in his futile attempt to prove that his method is equal to mine will sit in front of a half emptied live account and I doubt that he will double his lot-size again at the next valid signal. In fact, he will not do it because the next loss could mean a margin call for him. To sum it up: You have to invent a martingale loss-trader to "prove" your point while no believer in the "take a loss and move on" will ever recommend to trade martingale style. They will strictly warn everybody to even think about martingale trading. And I foresee what your next "argument" might be: But, if you unlock a dozen times at the wrong place, your floating loss will pile up to 50 % of your balance ...... I say: No, it will not because I will not open new cycles at a certain point. Then you could say: See ? The illusory martingale loss-taker who already lost 50 % of his money would then dare to place the next trade with double of the lot-size and if he is lucky, he will get no margin call and will break even on his terrible losses and thus I can prove that lossing and locking are not different but in fact lossing is better and locking is your way to a margin call. Well, I hope you see how futile your attempts are to "prove" your point. In this sense let us agree that we disagree. I can live with that.

This is an interesting thread and I feel a bit out place saying anything with all the big guns like nanningbob and hanover around. I have gone through the posts over and over again but I couldn't understand how fxtr51 works his trades even with all the elaborate explanations. I kept on going back to it because there was something in it that made a difference. After a dozen or so times I realised what has been attracting me back to this thread. It was something that fxtr51 said, "a floating loss is not a realized loss". I still don't understand fxtr51's method. Like he said, locking-unlocking for a trade to finally end as a breakeven or profit is an art. He is trying to explain art using mathematics, that's probably why I don't get it. The point is, there is 1001 ways to turn a hedged positing into a profit or at least a breakeven. It can be unlocked when the market turns the negative way and relock when it turns positive or vice versa, the range of the lock can be narrowed gradually, the positions can be averaged etc. The norm of using 5 or more indicators, then pinpointing an entry, setting up a TP and SL, forget about this trade and go looking for the next one is in direct contrast to a hedging method of marrying the trade and managing it to success which may take months or years. It needs continous attention (affection) and it then makes it difficult to trade multiple currencies. A monogamous trading life is unheard of with the diversification principle so prevalent. I just love the idea of not giving any money to my broker, since they have taken so much of it!

That's an extremely good point, and in my opinion is the essence of 'trading' and what distinguishes a trader from the crowd. Rather than admit their inability to master and psychologically adjust to the basic concept of trading some people prefer to try and compensate for their shortcomings by devising strategies similar to the one in this thread. How productive these strategies are compared to more conventional methods is an indisputable and simple mathematical calculation, however that doesn't stop them trying to justify it to themselves and to others who dare challenge their thinking. The debate will rage on forever, to admit the patently obvious would be nearly as painful as taking a loss for some of these people! http://i39.tinypic.com/5etlw0.jpg

You will get it when we only concentrate on 1 cycle. I go through an example: I get a signal to go Long. I enter the market with a Buy position, 1 % risk ( 20 Pips distance from OpenPrice to StopLoss price ). I place a pending Short at 20 Pips distance of the Long. If price goes up and hits my TP, the cycle is finished and I delete the pending Short. If price goes down and triggers my pending Short, I have 2 open positions and , both have no SL and the floating loss is frozen at 1 % ( 20 Pips ). Price can now move 1000 Pips up or down, I will still have 1% floating loss. (we neglect the swap , I will earn negative swap and then close the cycle at breakeven or in profit , so swap does not matter) Somewhere either below or above my hedge, I get a signal. Lets say that price moved 200 Pips down. There it stalls and bounces from monthly S/R or a round number or a Fib-level of a higher timeframe or it crosses the Alligator upwards or the Dinapoli thing or whatever. I get a good and reasonable signal to enter Long. According to my analysis price will turn up, trend is exhausted or just a pullback. It is a valid signal to go Long, ok ? There I unlock. What is that ? I close the Short with a nice profit. But that profit is not the point. Because the open Long is still in a floating loss. If price moves up 20 Pips from where I closed the Short, I can close the Long too. ( add spread where it applies ) Price moved down 200 Pips from where my Long open price is, but I don´t need a 200 Pips move upward to break even. I only need 20 Pips upwards, then I close the Long position with a loss. The total sum of Long and Short is zero. I got a breakeven on this cycle. That ends the cycle. If price doesn´t move 20 Pips up to release my cycle, but turns down again and continues to fall, for that case I have a pending Short below the level where I closed the first Short. This pending order could be 20 Pips below the unlock level or only 10 Pips, thus the new accumulated floating loss will be greater than the initial 1% . Therefore I should avoid to unlock too often. But it must not be so. Depends on the market. Because I could trail the price if it moves up to my favor and does not trigger the new pending short. With a 20 Pips distance trailing the price does not make much sense, but if the distance is 50 Pips or more, then it can make sense. Therefore it is not correct to say that each time I unlock wrong, my floating loss will increase and will bring me to a margin call. Because the floating can decrease as well. And now to the question how often I unlock and lock again because I chose the wrong level and price turns against me: If you look at a H4 chart with SMA50 on it and you trade inside bars and engulfing bars like 60minuteman does ( Buy Sell line strategy thread and Simple trend trading thread ), you will not find more than 2 or maximum 3 wrong levels in a row to unlock . In fact, wrong levels only happen when trend exhausts before the trend changes. Therefore the whole discussion about " but if you have to unlock and lock again 10 or 20 or 30 or 50 times in a row, you would get a margin call" is just drawn out of thin air and has no substance. But it is the only "argument" against lock-unlock. And still veterans appear who do not understand this all and just tell everybody about their misconceptions and prejudices and wrong conclusions. How come ? Because such is life and we can call it "locked minds". Only a few here unlocked their minds yet. Do you understand now how I trade it ?

And an important point here is that any system which failed 30 or 50 times in a row would almost certainly lead to overall failure of the system, irrespective of whether one hedges or implements stop losses, it's a pointless argument in the hedging debate.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Yes. And the invented martingale loss-trader would get his margin call after being wrong 5 or 6 times in a row (starting with 1% risk and doubling his lot-size to get even with the locker) or the broker server returns "not enough money, order canceled" when he tries to open 32 lots which is not realistic anyways because nobody would risk his whole money for recovering the initial loss of 1 %, while the locker has a floating loss (frozen) of 5 or 6 % in the best scenario and around 8 - 12 % in the worst scenario. But still they say: a margin call or having lost 50% of their money is not different from a floating 5 - 12 % (frozen) loss. That shows that the debate is not rational and sober from the stop-loss-takers party. They just continue to call it "crap" and "stupid" and insist on refuted arguments.

YES....I am almost there and it looks beautiful. Just one small question though. Let's take the Eur/Usd as an example. I have a 10k a/c. My entry is 1:1. I know you have mentioned that the locking point depends on a lot of factors like S/R, Fibs and PA but what would your average locking point be? Considering all your years of experience. You mentioned 50 pips in your example but it would be caught in intraday noise for Eur/Usd. You also said that the lock should be avoided as much as possible just like a SL. But it will also be easier to get rid of a lock of such a small range (for a profit or breakeven). Or am I still missing an important point? I know you are considering leaving this thread but hang in there will ya? Some of us are not done with you yet

Guys, please remember that fxtr51 is an active trader, an inspiring programmer and he also has a life outside of the forum. I'm not that patient as he is, I think I've heard and I've seen everything here , so I'm out of here. Bye, everybody!

Look, I have never in my life offended anyone on a public forum and I won't change my rule. However I must say that your complete inability to understand very simple logic and math is appalling. I have never changed any rule or twisted anything at all. I will make one last attempt to explain the basic premise and rules. We are looking at using SL vs. using hedging at the same point. 1. Every time the hedging trader opens a fresh position, the classical MM trader does the same, with the same size. 2. Every time the hedging trader opens a position to hedge a previous one the classical MM trader accepts his SL at the same level. 3. Every time the hedging player closes one leg of a hedged pair of trades the classical MM trader opens a position in the opposite direction, same size (e.g. if you close your long leg, I open a short position). I hope those rules are simple enough for you to understand. If your strategy is to close a leg of a hedged pair AND open a new position at the same point those are 2 actions. That is why the equivalent in the MM world is to open twice the lot size, one is for you closing a leg, the other one is for you opening a new position. That is not martingaling or changing any kind of rules. When you close your long leg and open a new short position you are net short by 2 lots. Exactly as the classical MM is, when he opens 2 lots at that point. If at one point you close 6 long legs and open 3 fresh shorts, that is for the classical MM player the action of opening 9 times the usual position size. Now you see, you are EXACTLY making my point. What people here keep trying to explain to you is that a 3% realized loss is exactly the same thing as a 3% floating loss. For you to recover those 3% floating loss positions you must make some wise decisions later. The classical MM player, making the same wise decisions, adds 3% to his account, while you get rid of the 3% floating loss. So overall you are both on breakeven. What you say here is something like this: If we both have 100k and we lose 10k ... the fact that you borrow 10k from a friend means you did a wise thing and you are 'richer' than I am. Because I have a "realized" loss and a balance of 90k, while you have a balance of 100k and owe someone 10k. You tell your friend that you will give his 10k back only when you have an opportunity to win 10k or more. But when that happens, I also make the same 10k or more, so we both end up in the same place. What you say here is utter nonsense. For you to recover the 3% floating loss you must do exactly the same thing, keeping the same "good" positions open with exactly the same number of lots. The only difference is that you have 2 shorts at 2 different levels, while the classical guy has them at the same level. Or 3 or 6 shorts or how many you want. In our example, if you close your hedged long leg, and open a new short, aren't you net short by 2 lots? If the price keeps falling, don't your 2 shorts make exactly as much money per pip as my 2 shorts? If the price keeps going up, don't your 2 shorts make exactly the same loss per pip as my 2 shorts? And if you start hedging again by opening longs don't you add more pips to your floating loss in the same manner? Is this so hard to understand? How can you say anything about martingaling? A guy who takes his SL is martingaling, and one who has 13 hedges is not? LOL. That's ridiculous. If you call opening 2 shorts martingaling, then having an old short open and opening a new one is also martingaling. There is no difference. I address one more time the same request that both me and Hanover have done, and if you fail to comply I consider it as best proof that you lost the argument: Provide a chart or a price drawing, no matter how simple or complicated you want. You choose it, you draw it, any way you want. We follow that chart together, step by step, using the 3 very simple rules that I outlined above. If at any point during the experiment you find that the hedging player has a higher equity than the classical MM player I swear this is my last post on FF. By equity I mean the total of balance and floating positions. E.g. if the MM player has a balance of 90 and the hedging guy has a balance of 130 but with -40 floating loss, they have the same equity. This is not something personal, I don't mind being wrong and I accept when I'm wrong - that is why I use SL when trading among other things. But it seems that you don't. So accept the challenge and that should end this silly debate once and for all. For me both outcomes are just great. I either prove to you and others reading the thread an obvious truth, or you prove that you have found a way to keep winning forever in the markets, something that no brilliant mind so far has seen.

It was nice meeting you and glad you participated. Hope we can meet up again. Poor Nacho, wonder what he is really thinking about his thread he started. Would have liked to see more of his trades since I also use the 5MA for some of my trades. That was what attracted me in the first place was to see some of his trades and setups.

Thanks for taking the time to explain. I understand what you are doing and comprehend the method.

Since the maths is a bit too difficult for me, thought I will just use the anology to understand what's going on. Pawn and Fxtr both have savings of 100k. Their trades are identical, TP is identical but only the losses are managed differently. So when the market moves against them by 10k, Pawn immediately pays the friend 10k and the balance is 90k. But Fxtr says something like "I owe you 10k and I will pay when I feel like it" hence his balance is still 100k. For the next few months both Pawn an Fxtr work the same trades and make the same profits without any losses but Fxtr has an additional responsibility of 10k to settle. Therefore he works a second job to settle 10k that he owes his friend. In trading terms, Fxtr looks for an opportunity to close the 2 trades for a breakeven in addition to the normal trades that both the traders would have taken irrespective of the time, spread or rollovers. I can't see if this increaseses risk but as long as you are not an American, margin requirements can be zero.

Of course you have. The basic comparison was this: 5 setups. 4 losers. 1 winner. I explained in great detail what the stop-losser will do at each level and what the locker will do. Of course the locker will be ahead and come out with + 1 % while the losser will come out with -3 %. Go back and read and you will see it. When you finally realized that my math is correct, you invented new rules. Suddenly you said that the losser would double his lot-size to break even. This way you twisted it to justify your point. Now you say that I completely lack to understand very simple logic and math. Thank you, that just proved your point that you never offended anyone on a forum and you won´t change your rule ? Aren´t you able to read what I have written a dozen times ? Instead you are attesting me a lack of understanding. No need for that because it is a different basic premise than I used all the time. The thread is full of such wrong assumptions of the loss-believers, that´s why I wrote a dozen times that your assumptions are wrong, but you didn´t get it. You are talking about something else and then blame me for being stupid. That is not a sober discussion, LazyPawn. I don´t need it and nobody else does.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks too, nanningbob. I understand too what you are doing ( have read the document about the Recovery which was posted in Alfredo´s thread ) and comprehend it. And I know that Al and others are very successfull with it. My chosen initial risk of 1% is too high for my comfort zone for averaging in order to reach BE, therefore I prefer lock-unlock.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Simply stating that you fare better without at least ONE CONCRETE example doesn't help your cause. I never changed the rules, it was probably a misunderstanding on your part. If you simply close the long leg, I open a short. If you close the long leg plus open a fresh short, obviously the equivalent is opening 2 shorts. You refuse to accept the theoretical mathematical model - that's fine, maybe math is not your strong point. But then you also refuse to go step by step with me over any kind of example that YOU choose - that would help you and everyone see that the outcome is the same. I rest my case here. Good trading to you.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Yes but that is an acceptable alternative for larger lot trading. I had been working with Steve Hopewood on a recovery EA that would have done a hedge and unhedged when price came back but ended the project with the hedge ban in the USA. I see you fine tuned the idea. I have set my loss on recovery at max 1% and that seems to work very well. No danger of big losses and enough room that the vast majority of recoveries are successful. Anyway my next project is projecting the strength of a move. With this info you can decide to stay in or get out and even add to a winning position. Testing it now and getting certain indicators adjusted to the system. Al's system gave me the idea and adding some interesting twists for higher chart trading. Hopefully ready and tested by May. Where or where is Nacho?? LOL

--- 帖子 #182 ---
No, it is not the equivalent. It is your definition of it. But all the time my definition was different. I understand your mathematical model but it does not fit and you simply refuse to accept that. So here are the rules: 5 entries. 4 of them hit SL. 1 goes to TP. The losser enters 5 positions with 1 % risk each. The locker enters 5 positions with 1 % risk each and besides that he is locking and unlocking a few times. The losser will not take action when the locker is doing his locking and unlocking. He is only entering 5 positions and accepts the loss or the profit. That is the premise I described from the first moment I posted about the lock-unlock. All I wrote was based on this premise. Is it too hard to understand for you ? I don´t think so. I rather think that you simply refused to accept this premise because you had your own agenda. Unfortunately you did nothing than comparing apples to oranges henceforth. My math is this: losser: - 4 + 1 = - 3 % loss. locker: 0 + 1 = + 1 % profit. Your own made premise includes a martingale progression for the losser. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 etc. according to your rules. Do the math if you can. Or maybe your personal definition of martingale is different from that which is common ? Before you offended me, you made sure that you defined your premise to support that offense, while before that moment you did not define your premise like that. Great black rhetoric tricks you are playing here in order to break your own rules of conduct. What you basically are saying is: If a losser trades a martingale progression ( which normal lossers will not do) he will be even with the locker. I hope everybody understands that. But it was besides the point all the time. The point was that the losser would not take extra trades like the locker does ... and that the losser would not trade martingale style. You wasted your time and you broke your own rules of conduct several times and why all of this misery ? Because you were not willing to accept the premise. Now go and figure that out .....

The hedger and the SL guy are both experienced operators and know that their system never had more than 3 losses in a row. Both can come out with the same profit with the same risks. signal: SL guy 1 lot loosing trade = 30 pips loss Hedger 1 lot loosing trade = 30 pips hedged next signal: SL guy places 2 lots Hedger unlocks hedge and places 1 extra lot both unlucky: SL now 90 pips loss, hedger 90 pips hedged. next signal: SL guy places 3 lots Hedge unlocks 2-lot hedge and places 1 extra lot both unlucky again!: SL now 180 pips loss, hedger 180 pips hedged next signal: SL guy places 4 lots Hedge unlocks 3-lot hedge and places 1 extra lot both lucky: SL guy as well as Hedger ends up with a 30 pip profit overall. so its really just a preference how a trader wants to trade. but the SL guy as well as the hedger should normally have smaller positions in the market to be able to add to positions later on. this will affect profit if only 1 succesful trade is needed. also from this example it is clear that it does not matter if hedging is not available for the US people.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
But this is not about what you (fxtr51) or I (LazyPawn) accept or refuse. It is simply about the truth regarding 2 different ways of managing trades. We want to determine if one of them can be made more profitable than the other. Your contention is that by using a lock/unlock model of some kind (which you are free to define as you wish) you end up making more money than any traditional SL method. My point of view, shared by all great traders that I know of, institutions, banks etc. is that the lock/unlock model cannot outperform the standard model and in fact it is a little worse due to trading costs. Now what are you trying to do here? You are trying to make the SL model look bad by allowing the locker to have twice the lot size open in the good direction, but you don't allow the same thing for the SL model. It is obvious that in such a case the locker grabs more pips on any good move. But that's simply the result of having more lots during that particular move. You can define what you do as a locker - your rules, for your trading. But you cannot force the SL player to have inferior rules for his trading. The SL player simply shows you that he gets exactly the same results as you do by following his own rules. And to be clear: in fact his results are better, because he doesn't pay the rollover fees that you incur by keeping longs and shorts at the same time on the same pair, sometimes for several days or maybe even weeks. But I'll leave that aside for now. If this is not clear enough I will bring it to an extreme, to see the absurdity of your position. Suppose a locker (not you, someone else) at some point has taken 10 bad positions in a row, and each of them is hedged at a distance of 20 pips. Overall he has a floating loss of 200 pips where the SL person would have 200 realized loss. And then he sees this great signal on the chart to go short. His strategy is that at that point he will close all his longs, so he has 10 shorts open. And maybe he even opens a new fresh short, so that makes it 11. From that point, any pip is worth 11 times more than usual to the equity, and a small good move could make hundreds or thousands of pips. But for the SL player - you give him only 2 options. You say that he should only be allowed to have 1 lot open there, so he doesn't have the 11x factor as the locker has ... or if he opens 11 positions to have the same progression as the locker, you say that he's martingaling (and the locker is not ). Do you see the double standard there? On one hand you allow yourself to be 2 or maybe even more net positions short or long ... on the other hand if the SL player does the same you say he's martingaling. You cannot have it both ways. Of course he is taking action! If he is not taking action it means the 2 traders do not read the charts in the same way. That was the most basic premise, that both traders have exactly the same signals on their charts, the same trading system, and what is SL to one guy is moment to hedge for the other guy. When the locker does something he does it because he has a signal, right? At the same time the SL player also has the exact same signal. A weak signal showing that maybe the upmove is finished would make a locker close his long leg and the SL player to open a short. A strong signal showing that upmove is finished and strong downmove likely to happen makes the locker close the long leg AND open a short ... and it makes the SL player open a short with double the size. A super-mega-extra signal that makes the locker close 4 long legs and open a fresh short would make the SL player open a short with 5 times the usual size. Again, if you don't allow the SL trader to do this, then you are simply forcing him to play by some rules that you invented FOR HIM, to make him gain less pips than the locker. That's like me defining some losing rules for the locker and then claiming that it's not profitable. My goal is simply to show you that whatever rules you invent for the lock/unlock money management they can be replicated perfectly well with the SL management. So the steps in my view are the next: 1. The locker defines his rules. When, what lot size, when does he lock/unlock, how much, when does he add new positions, when does he close them etc.. 2. The SL trader then defines his rules to show that the outcome (equity) will be always the same as the locker's. 3. If the locker still thinks that his method leads to a bigger equity, they take a chart chosen by the locker and follow the rules defined above, to see who is right. I hope what I said above makes perfect sense. I also have a different question for you, regarding your locking method and depending on your answer I have another important point to make. Consider our common chart. You enter the initial sell position, it goes bad, you lock it with a buy 30 pips above. Fine. You get a second sell signal and then, as you say, you close the long leg and open a short. At this point you have 2 shorts. Then if the price refuses to go down, I suppose you would hedge again after another 30 pips. Is this new hedge with 2 lots, to cover the 2 shorts you have open, or with just one lot (so that you have 2 shorts and 1 long)? And then if the same thing happens for a third time, will you then have 3 longs opened at this new high level? Yonnie , thank you very much. I see at least one person understands what I'm saying here.

The discussion was never meant to prove that from my side and I made that clear all the time in each posting. For you it was and I called it "twisting the rules". But since you never accepted my rules which did not allow the losser to open additional trades to get even, you always ended up offending me. Can you see that pattern in this thread ? Or not ? Instead of just trying to understand what I explained dozens of time, you always tried to argue on a completely different premise. That cannot work and you proved it doesn´t. Because it is flawed logic and comparing apples with oranges. A reasonable path of discussion would have looked like this: Oh, I see that you don´t allow the losser to martingale. You make it impossible that he gets even and thus you are correct: the locker will be ahead and make more profits. But I (LazyPawn) want you to see that if a losser will use martingale progression and enter at certain levels where you unlock, then there is no difference in both methods (in fact the losser is better due to trading costs ). I would have said: Ok, then show me how the losser could do this. That would have been a sober discussion between grown up people. But since you had your own agenda ( which you were hiding at the beginning ) and you never accepted my premise, you acted like what ? Offending in about each of your postings. You are not ready yet to accept and see what you have done. Instead you justify your behavior and try to make me look like an idiot. That is a problem, LazyPawn and it is not my problem. Wrong again. I completely understand what you are saying after you finally revealed your hidden agenda and defined the premise you had in mind from the start. Before that I wondered why you tried so hard to twist my premise to make it fit to your desired outcome. Do you understand what happened and what you did ? I certainly do. A good communication is only possible when none of the partners has a hidden agenda. Our communication was a desaster because you had one while I said from the very beginning what my premise is. Do you still feel an urge to offend and attack me ?

fxtr51, I have never offended you deliberately. It is true that I expressed doubts regarding your mathematical understanding, when I became exasperated. But I also praised you for your coding skills. If my words looked offending to you, I apologize. However you did that more than once and I will only quote one such instance below: Regarding the secret agenda, I definitely never had one. I always tried to get explanations from you which you constantly refused to give, simply stating over and over again that you already did that in some previous posts somewhere. I read all your posts and charts, didn't find a clear explanation of the method, but I was still ready to discuss it. That's why I used your chart, that's why I asked you questions (you never asked me any), that's why I constantly invited you to work together through a chart or drawing example, to see where we have a misunderstanding (if there was one). Even in my last post I repeated the same invitation. All this time you just told me that -3% is less than +1%. Anyway I am willing to put all that aside, and what is really of interest to me is if you agree that a SL management can be conceived which mimics your hedging method 100% in terms of equity? I hope the answer is yes. I am also willing to show you that using only 1 position size every time for the SL player, while it could very well lead to inferior equities, is much safer if you happen to have a string of losses. In other words the conservative SL player who always uses the same 1 lot doesn't win that much if things go well in general, but loses only a little when things go really bad and you lose a lot. Then for my second question, please read the last paragraph of my previous message. I think you don't see the problem with the way your floating loss increases. For example, you probably assume that after the first lock you are at -1% (correct), and that after the second lock you are at -2, and after the 6th you are at -6%. In fact the progression is 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 ... (the so called triangular numbers). In other words if you have a sequence of 4 trades gone bad your account equity would be at -10% (it's composed of a 18% growth in balance plus -28% floating loss). If you don't see where those numbers are coming from I am ready to explain in my next post.

Fxtr51, If you re-read my earlier comments, I explained why I believe unrealized losses should be considered to be real. It is a contentious issue, with folk sitting in one camp or the other, but just for the record, here are some folk who agree with me: http://www.secondopinions.ca/newslet...dopinion2.aspx http://investing-school.com/definiti...ns-and-losses/ http://www.theforextrader.net/Realiz...ed-Returns.php http://blog.realized-app.com/basics/...gain-real.html http://www.the-money-cafe.com/Paper-...es-Stupid.html (this article raises the point that the current global crisis has been caused primarily by banks allowing paper losses to escalate out of control) http://www.investmentterms.net/Paper+Loss-definition/ http://www.schwab-global.com/public/...ing_stock.html I’ve no doubt that you could likewise perform an internet search, and find folk who share your view. I will re-state the reasons for my opinion , one final time, hopefully with greater clarity. Essentially what we are doing is speculating on the future value of an asset, and the key is probability. I’ll accept that unrealized losses don’t need to be considered, if there’s a 100% certainty that they will return to breakeven (or better), before they accumulate to the point of ruin (i.e. a margin call, or otherwise irretrievable drawdown). That is because I believe that avoiding ruin must necessarily be the first priority of every trader. If, at a given point, the probability of a loss decreasing is no better than 50/50, then I believe that the loss should be considered to be real, simply because there is an equal probability of it worsening, and it must be realized at some point. The point at which all losses must ultimately be realized is a margin call. In post #147, you state that “ I always manage to close my cycle with a breakeven or profit ”. The key word is ALWAYS. If this is a 100% certainty, then I accept that the frozen/floating loss need not be considered, because there is an absolute guarantee that breakeven will be attained at some future point. That is a key point common to all grid/hedge/recovery MM systems — whether or not they can return to breakeven, before ruin occurs. There is another reason why I consider unrealized losses to be real. I’ve already made this same point in two earlier posts. Your legal agreement with your br0ker states that the amount of money in your account that is available to you at any point includes unrealized P/L. If for whatever reason, you urgently need to close the account (e.g. you have a family emergency; or you’ve just heard a rumor that your br0ker is about to go belly up; etc etc), then you must realize all of your losses. I’m not discussing the probability of any of these events occurring, just that this is the amount of money that is actually available to you at any given point, for any practical use. ______________ Now let’s return to the original issue, which is the extent to which your edge comes from your trading expertise (i.e. how accurately you time adjustments to your overall position), as opposed to your MM (i.e. the way in which you use your “cycles”). The concept of a “cycle” not ending until breakeven or better is attained, is exactly the same as the gambling concept that the punter will not end any roulette session (“cycle”) at the casino until such time as that session is profitable. That way, by never having a losing session, he is guaranteed to always remain ahead, and thus beat the casino. There is, of course, a fallacy in that argument, whose fundamental basis is that no player can ultimately beat a negative expectancy game, with the result that the punter's losses are always likely to escalate more quickly than he can recover them. And it’s borne out by the fact that no punter (apart from exploiting physically biased wheels) has ever managed to beat a casino consistently at roulette. Your trading expertise (“ if you look on a H4 chart, you can find moves of 200 - 800 Pips and more in one direction all the time. And within such moves you always have pullbacks. The whole Fib trading armada lives from that fact. Therefore in every move there will be plenty of unlock levels and when I need 30 - 70 Pips to break even and the pullback is 100 - 200 Pips ”) is what guarantees that you “ always manage to close your cycle with a breakeven or profit ”. To whatever extent that gives you an edge, you’re playing a positive expectancy game against the market. I believe that your definition of a “cycle” is completely arbitrary, and therefore illusory. You could group your trades any way that you wish, but you can’t escape the fact is that your overall bottom line is always the sum of all of these trades, and each trade contributes either positively or negatively to this balance, in its own right. Recovery systems focus on recovery of recent losses, but I would argue that all losses (of the same size) have an equal effect on bottom line. Your cycle has to get back to breakeven somehow, and it faces an identical battle, pip-wise, as the losser, who (assuming equivalent trading expertise, and making the same trading decisions in terms of being net long, short or flat at the same points along the way) does exactly the same thing , albeit over a series of open/close trades. As demonstrated in post #122. To the losser, then, a “cycle” is simply defined as his entire account. Given that he has the same trading skill as the locker, he has the same probability of returning his account to breakeven, thereby ending his current “cycle”. You say that freezing losses gives them the opportunity to return to breakeven. Sure, but they still have to claw back the same pips, when they are unlocked. And the losser has exactly the same opportunity, simply by placing additional trades. A good way to determine whether or not a component is contributing to a whole is to examine the effect of that component in isolation. If “cycle” based MM provided an edge capable of overcoming costs, then any trader who used it would be profitable, regardless of his trading expertise, by simply trading random entries and exits. Conclusion : a trader’s edge comes from his trading expertise — the way that he times his entries and exits — not from his MM. That has always been true, and will always remain so. This is also borne out by the actual results: if markets could be beaten merely by using MM, then there would be no need for analysis. Every one of us could simply run an EA that used random entries and exits, but employed this MM, and retire rich. ______________ This hedging/locking debate has occurred many times before. It became a hot topic when NFA decided to ban hedging in the US. Here are some threads where these same points have been repeatedly (and passionately) discussed: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=68598 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=163814 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=137836 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=163467 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=264690 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=174626 Look for posts by smittens4212, merlin, Craig, birdt, nubcake, philmcgrew, 7bit and pipmutt. Perhaps they can explain all of this better than I can. LazyPawn has also provided some good explanations in this thread. ______________ This post is my last one. I have nothing more to say on this topic, as I have already expressed my views many, many times. I am not trying to prove that I am right. I am simply telling you what I believe, and why. All I will say is that I have satisfied myself that it has sound logical and mathematical basis, and I have yet to read anything that seriously threatens it. David

we assume 2 experienced operators, who know their system in and out. the hedger will know what the maximum number of straight losses is and will enter a position and hedge that position accordingly. a prudent hedger will err on the side of caution. from my example above the hedger will have a 180 pip floating loss before closing everything out for a 30 pip profit on the other hand the conservative SL player who uses the same lot all the time will do the same 4 trades at 1 lot each and his P/L shows -30, -30, -30 and +30 = -60 pips. I would say the hedger will always come out on top, unless the conservative SL player will become more creative. mind you, the conservative trader will always be happy with (a lot) less profit knowing that he risks less. hanover: the issue here is NOT about if floating losses are real or not

Yes it is (well, at least in the context of my discussion with fxtr51). My post #190 explains why.

I will start a thread or continue in 10.0. Depends how much I vary from from it but the basis will still be 10.0. My focus on trading for the last year or so has been defining clearly what people talk about in Forex. What is a trend or a range? When do they start when do they end. Now I want to define the strength of the price movement. Knowing this allows a person to add positions or close the position because it isnt going anywhere or the move is going to move now. I dont know if I can do that but that is what I will try to do.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
hanover, what a masterpiece you delivered. That is what I like and what I call a sober conversation. I will not comment each sentence, it is after midnight and I am up now 19 hours but only make a few comments: I agree and add: only by placing more trades, otherwise the locker is ahead. The whole discussion went into the wrong direction because my premise was that the losser would not place more trades in order to get even but that premise was ignored. This way apples were compared to oranges and we saw where that path is going. Never say never and never say always and never say 100 % certainty. A tornado could kill me, then my hedge would collapse somewhere in the future when somebody is trying to get the heritage. Or 100 other things could happen. It was wrong to say "always" because that will never work in this world as we know it. I did not think about the casino thing and about the "never say always" thing. I simply looked on a H4 chart and concluded that I would always find levels to unlock and go to BE or into profit. Enough said. My conclusion : I will continue to improve my trading skills because that will increase my profits - with locking or without. Thanks for your contribution and thanks to all those who contributed too.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hanover is a smart guy and always worth listening to his comments. What I like about him is he also posts his trading system and tries to teach better trading methods and systems. He just doesnt harass you but shows alternatives which you can studly and compare. He makes an interesting debate.

OK, I have decided to write a small pdf that should put an end to all the confusion surrounding these methods, since very few people understand their true mathematical expectation. It took me a few hours but I hope most people will find it interesting. I tried to make it as simple as possible, with graphics and detailed explanations, and I hope that anyone is able to understand it.

There is absolutely no difference in regards of profits between the SL-trading and the lock/unlock trading except the SL-trader has the guts to take the loss when the SL got hit and the lock/unlock trader is trying to make it up at a later point. When the locker’s are taking the signal to unlock and recover the open floating loss the SL-trader will enter a position and close a profitable trade and in the end both are equal. When the SL-trader does hit 5 times in a row a let’s say 30 pips stop-loss he is 150 pips down. When the locker starts to lock the first trade and on the next 4 wrong entries unlock and lock later on again, he is also 150 pips down with the only difference that the 150 pips are reflected in open DD while the SL-trader has everything closed and the losses are booked. Both of them need a 150 pip gain to get back at breakeven. It is a personal choice of each one which trade management strategy better fits. I personally prefer the SL-method … if it went wrong it went wrong. And if it went wrong let’s say 10 times in a row I should definitely make some thoughts about my entries, if the strategy fits to the current market or about the strategy at all. On the other side – if a locker after a couple of bad entries or let’s say better “wrong unlocks” and “locks” get into a larger and larger open DD it may have an impact into further trade decisions and lead to unlock when the conventional SL-trader probably wouldn’t even enter a position at all.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
FXTR51, Reading the posts between you and LazyPawn …. I didn’t have the impression that LazyPawn wanted to change any rules into his favor nor that he likes to recover losses in a martingale way. You said in post No. 146 When you unlock your hedged trade and additionally enter a second position you are definitely with 2 positions in the market. Let’s say each one with 1 lot ….. total 2 lots. It doesn’t mean anything in this case what you call a cycle. At that precise moment you have 2 positions open on the same pair into the same direction. So his conclusion was ….. as a SL-trader I can do the same. When I get stopped out on my first trade I can enter the next one also with 2 lots. In the end there is no difference.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I would like to add that the recovery trader has one advantage over the SL taker. Many of my trades in recovery that a SL taker takes a hit also become profitable meaning they never become a loss. That is the great advantaged missed in this debate. SL loss people fail to see that what they take losses on we often also take a profit on. If and when he unlocks both trades can end up in profit. Once you take a SL it will always be a loss. That is the other side of the formula ignored. Because these techniques take trading skill, the skillful recovery trader has the advantage of turning losers into winners which a SL formula never allows, he always has to recover a losing trade. I always have the advantage of making temporarily losing trades back into winners. That is the advantage and the edge. It is why many of us have such high winning scenarios that hover around 75-80% winners. That is the advantage that is ignored every time we have this discussion. You think if you only focus on that one occasional really negative trade it wipes every thing else out. NO it does not. It is just the occasional loss every trader takes.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
You are right Bob but like most of the time …. an advantage has usually also some kind of disadvantage behind it. The locker or recovery trader has the advantage to turn the floating loss into a profit while the SL-trader booked the loss already. But nothing is 100% sure and there is still the possibility that the floating loss can get bigger or worse finish at some point as a loser too, while the SL trader doesn’t have it anymore. The loss is booked and that’s it. As I said …. It’s a personal choice of each one which trade management strategy better fits. In regards to the higher win%: Of course the win% for hedge or recovery traders is a way higher, as they carry on with the negative trades and most of the time turn it back into winners, but a higher win% alone doesn’t necessarily mean a higher profit at the end.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Now it comes to money management. Here is where I use a percentage of account over number of pips. When a trade hits negative 1% of my account I will do something with it more than a Counter (Used as an adjective for the ninny's that dont understand the English language) Trade. But at that point I dont let trades get bigger than that. This is where the arguments about wiping out an account are laughable to me. They ignore that we still practice MM. But then again when you focus only on the negative you dont see the rest. Off to Bei Hai for Easter weekend Bye.

LazyPawn, you invested a lot of time (me too) and your conclusion is this: I bet you are not aware that you proved my method is the better one because it has a superior expectancy long term and I will always be ahead of the losser. Your whole problem is your lack of awareness and dignity towards others who write something which goes against your deeply engrained beliefs. Here are the reasons for my claims: 1. I outlined from the very first posting that the losser will not take additional entries at the level where the pending order of the locker is placed. Again for you, LazyPawn, because you are still ignoring it: the losser will not take additional entries at the level where the pending order of the locker is placed. Do you get it now, LazyPawn ? Or do you still react as you did the whole time ? You had no "secret agenda", your agenda was transparent to you, you did not even think about it ( the term "transparent" is from NLP = NeuroLinguistic Programming, you can google it if you want an understanding of what it is ). What was your agenda ? Something like this: "Oh , again another guy who thinks he can hedge, although mathematicians and great traders have proven that it does not work". This made you blind to really let my premise enter your thinking. It did not matter to you and later on you "justified" your agenda. "Hey, you cannot just take more trades than the losser. I am telling you what you must do, you stupid and unlogical guy who doesn´t understand simple math. " That was and still is your agenda, LazyPawn. Are you now aware of it ? Does it register ? Instead of accepting what I wrote, you tried to prove your thing and that implied that you don´t accept my premise. That was your whole fight here and you offended and kept on offending me although you broke your rules of conduct by it. 2. Based on my premise and based on the observance of H4 charts, I proved that you cannot find more than 1 or 2 bad unlock levels on any chart. This is the "guarantee" that my lock-unlock is superior to the classic losser. You proved it mathematically in your PDF, remember ? 3. A classical losser will not enter a trade at a SL-level. It is against his philosophy. Thus even that part of your "logic" is flawed because it does not reflect real life. I have about 400 manual trading systems on my harddrive, most of them commercial and some free systems. 99.99 % are losser type of systems. Nowhere they teach: Reverse your trade at the SL level. But they do teach: Accept that your analysis was wrong, take the loss and wait for a better signal. The odds are normally stacked up to your favor with such setups, but not all will work out. You cannot expect to win each setup. Accept it, accept the loss and move on. Believe and trust that if you religiously follow the rules, combined with sound MM, you will be profitable long term with this method. But what did you do ? After not dignifying my premise, in your quest to prove that I am idiot and all others too who hedge, you invent completely new losser trading styles like reversing a trade at the SL - level. Are you aware where your quest to prove your point has led you ? I know manual systems which keep you in the market by reversing at the opposite signal etc. But those are about 0.1 % of all losser strategies and my premise was not that the losser will reverse his losing trade. My premise was that he accepts the loss and does nothing until the next valid signal presented itself. Didn´t matter to you. You invented the martingale losser who increases his lot-size although I always said: No, the losser will not change the lot-size. My conclusion: My lock-unlock method is mathematical sound, is logical and has a superior positive expectancy to most losser type of systems. You proved that in your PDF although you are not aware you did. However on forums like Forex Factory where anyone can make absurd claims regarding methods like martingale, recovery, no stop-loss, increasing bet sizes, lock-unlock, futile hedging and so on … many traders are drawn to such methods because they try to bypass the unpleasant feeling generated by closing a trade as a loss. Even worse are those who are locked into their prejudices and driven by an overpowering urge to justify their beliefs. They are on a crusade to humiliate everyone who dares to think outside of their losser mental-box. No means is bad enough to accomplish their mission, everything is used: not dignifying others , ignoring their arguments, ignoring their premises, calling names, offenses. Unfortunately they always find followers who post one-liners , usually containing words like "crap", by which they demonstrate that they too are not able to understand their locked state of mind and what the discussion is all about. This pulls the level of debate to a pattern which is common to primitive and antisocial people. It is kind of a mob mentality. Many problems in the world origin in such behavior. Sad, but true. Once the trader understands that he’s simply playing a game of probabilities he should choose the methods that have a superior expectancy long term.

fxtr51, I did my best to understand your method and to investigate it. I always do that when someone comes with something that has been proven for centuries as wrong, and claims that it's good. It's my nature, maybe because of the scientific background. If I still didn't understand your method correctly, please feel free to post a document similar to mine to describe what you actually do and compare it to other traditional methods, proving that it's superior long term. If as you claim in your latest post your using LU is based on the fact that your particular method cannot have more than 2-3 losing trades in a row, then I accept that LU is superior to the simple CSL method (although not by much) - and inferior to the method I called ISL (due to trading costs). I clearly showed that in my file. But if that's the truth, you shouldn't be using 1% per trade, you should be using much much more. Read about Kelly's formula and expectations. Plus there are other ways that would increase your account even faster than the LU (again, assuming that you cannot have 4 losses in a row). The reason values like 0.5%-2% are suggested as good risk trades is exactly because with a 1:1 RR reaching a bad sequence of signals is going to happen. So ... to make things clear: if the 4hr method that you are using cannot have 4 or more consecutive losses it's a great idea to use LU, and I also suggest you use a much higher risk, to increase your equity faster. If your 4hr strategy can have strings of losses like all 1:1 strategies known to man so far, then it's better to revert to the classical money management ways and use low leverage. This is purely a discussion about trade management, math and expectations. I don't understand why you keep trying to move it to a personal level. I am not interested in that and won't answer such things. Calling me primitive and antisocial is more than ridiculous, as anyone following the discussion can confirm. Losing the argument makes you resort to such cheap insults. And just one more thing - I never said or implied that the SL player opens a new position at the SL level. I have no idea where you get that from. It was never said here, it is not in the pdf or anywhere else. He opens a new position when he has a new signal. The CSL player opens 1 lot, the ISL increases his lot size if the previous trade was a loss, but they both open it when they have a signal.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Amazing. Look: And look, now you found yourself getting heated up, so to speak, but of course, LazyPawn, you didn´t keep trying to move it to a personal level. No, absolutely not. Not you. That was when you defined new rules because you had to "win the argument at all costs". Of course "followers" showed up als always, not understanding what they are talking about. This is all not on a personal level, Lazy Pawn ? For me it is, if you allow. Especially after you finally proved yourself my method is superior. Your followers, or let us call them "the SL-believers" vented. Nothing on a personal level ? Only me who is trying to pull it to a personal level although I never started to offend but only reacted to such attacks ? Maybe I should have lost patience, maybe I am the culprit here, or ? And now you again, nowhere near taking it to a personal level of course. I repeat your own words , LazyPawn You are not interested to admit something here, it seems to me. But you can do better, like here, LazyPawn And again, I only remember you of your own words: Somehow your words don´t add up. No , it was not. You made your own rules in order to prove me wrong. Later on you justified why you did this but still failed to see the obvious. Only in your PDF you proved it in front of all that my method is superior, something which I had shown you from the beginning. But you needed to get through with your agenda first. Then , after justifying your changing of rules, you come along with this: Has nothing to do with a personal level, right ? And then you construct something which has been refuted long before Oh yes, ( not you, someone else ) , but with someone else you want me to see the "absurdity" of my position. After I showed that it is hard to find 2 losing setups in a row on a H4-chart, which everybody can verify for himself, you now had to invent "someone else, not me" who must be blind to find 10 losing setups in a row to get me to "see the absurdity" of my position. Although I know the danger of lock-unlock myself, which is unlocking too many times at the wrong levels. But for you I am obviously stupid, too stupid to know the advantages and disadvantages of what I do and therefore you need to invent blindfolded "others" who will go the road to their margin call which I will not go, while all I have to do is to wait for a valid signal on H4 to get out of the cycle with a breakeven or profit. And I am telling you a "secret" here: I sometimes am in a cycle and unlock at a good S/R like round number or on a break of a trendline (H4 or higher trendline) and book my green pips, then watch the PA and lock at the same level as before. Then again PA goes somewhere and I unlock booking another portion of green Pips and locking again even at a better level than before. It happens many times, I just didn´t mention it to keep it simple. And in the context of my premise, the losser has no chance to get even with me, so why making the SL-believers even more angry ? I understand. It was a necessity for you to "win the argument", right ? Or what other motivation do you see ? Well put. Let us see if it holds water This is your way of "expressing doubts" ? And of course it isn´t personal, yes ? Oh, how gracious. Now I should be quiet and completely happy, right ? By the way, my mql coding skills are not good, I am a beginner at best. That is fact. Anyhow. That praise cannot make up for the offenses. I didn´t call you that. I referred to those who are posting one-liners with words like "crap" . And your insults don´t count of course because they were put in more sophisticated shape. You are better than others, obviously, so why do you think I referred to you ? Sorry for pointing to the contradictions in what you try to look like and what you wrote.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
fxtr51 , Why are you quoting all those things trying to make it look like I said them? I didn't use the word crap, I didn't use the word panties, I didn't talk about April's fool joke and so on. Those quotes come from other people. Why do you put them all in one basket, to confuse people who didn't read my posts? The only remarks that were mine are those regarding math and logic, and even those were said after insults coming from you. Anyway I see that you are not interested at all in discussing trading or money management here, you just want to have a fight with someone. So please ignore me just as I will ignore you from now on. Find someone else to have such a "debate" with. For a moment I thought you really wanted to compare some methods, to analyze data, to calculate profitability ... that's why I analyzed charts, I discussed examples, I asked you questions and asked for details about your method, I invited you repeatedly to follow a chart or drawing together to see how the methods compare, I wrote a pdf and so on. Several times I asked you to discuss concrete examples, you ignored them. You're here to pick up a fight not to see how methods compare and what to expect. This is the end of my conversation with you, you really don't deserve my time. I won't read your posts or address you anymore. To all the other traders who may have a genuine interest in the topic at hand - if you are interested in analyzing the truth behind the luck-unlock methods please download the pdf and see for yourself. Feel free to test various other scenarios following the guide that I wrote. The method has the same expectation as the simple increasing of the bet size after a loss, the only difference being that the costs and stress related to having multiple positions open on the same pair are higher. The method can theoretically be profitable for a 1:1 RR system only if that system doesn't generate more than 2-3 losing signals in a row. When there are more your account will be depleted really fast. From a practical point of view the method should never be used for 2 reasons: 1. There is no 1:1 RR system that doesn't have a string of losses, even 10 or more, not to mention 4. This thing has been proved so many times by statisticians and real life trading that it's beyond doubt. They can be rare but they will happen, something that's been shown over and over again. When this "black swan" strikes you wipe out your account. The extra 1% you get by hoping that you never get more than 3 bad signals in a row is not worth taking the risk. To give you an idea, even if the system has an excellent 60% winning rate, the chance of 4 consecutive losses within the first 50 is huge (70.4%) - making it close to certain ... and the chance of running into a series of 10 consecutive losses is 0.4%. And that's just for the first 50 trades. More trades and you're definitely going to hit one of those bad runs. What does 10 consecutive losses mean? It means -10% if you risk 1% per trade, classical way. Bad ... but you're still in the game. And if you're using the lock-unlock method it's -55%! It's very hard from a psychological point of view to recover after such a blow. 2. Assuming the truly miraculous finding of a 1:1 RR strategy that never has more than 3 losing trades in a row (something never heard of), it would still be a very bad idea to use the locking-unlocking technique, for the simple fact that a simple increase in the bet size (e.g. using 10% risk per trade instead of 1%) would be much more profitable. You can check this simple simulator and you will see that the Kelly value for a 1:1 RR system with a 65% winning rate is 30% (so the ideal risk per trade should be 30% not 1% for maximum growth). Even if we use a very conservative approach of only 1/3 Kelly the risk per trade should still be 10% not 1%. In other words if the system has the usual expectancy of a very good solid system (which is only a few percent above 50%), then the lock-unlock strategy is doomed to failure. If the system has an incredible expectancy then you would gain more/faster using other methods such as the simple increase of your bet size. Why are these very obvious truths, mathematically proven, ignored by so many traders? It's human psychology. On one hand we have the desire to avoid the immediate loss, on the other hand the false sense of security generated by a few days, weeks or even months when the "risky" method worked. Some people are incredibly naive, they really think that the most brilliant minds that work in this business combined with the best technologies that money can buy failed to notice their little lock-unlock/martingale/recovery brilliant idea. They are right and the experts are wrong.

I did not try to look like you said them, that is your wrong assumption only. I quoted them in the context of the discussion and the direction it went, you being a part of the problem. Wrong. You started to insult me. And still you refuse to take responsibility for it. Again wrong. That description fits for you and you demonstrated that along the way. Ask those who treat me with respect. They have a completely different perception of me. How come ? Again wrong. I discussed my method, posted a screenshot and explained it several times. You had a different agenda all the time. You tried to introduce your made up rules in order to "prove me wrong". Obviously not, but your description fits for you. You are good in projections. You see your own shortcomings in others who don´t have them and then accuse them and insult them for "not having enough brains" to understand your point. Yes, that is fine. Saves me a lot of time. Again you are wrong, because you never asked or cared how I trade the system in real life. Here is a short list of your wrong assumptions which lead you to wrong conclusions: 1. My system is not 1:1 RR. You attacked it on that assumption and I agreed because allowing different RRs would have complicated the comparison. 2. You are talking about 4 and more losing signals in a row which will deplete the account very fast. a) my system has maximum 2 or 3 losing signals in a row, it will not deplete the account. b) I do not trade how you described it in your PDF. I do not start a new cycle at each unlock-level. Why should I ? I just unlock and wait, having my safety-net placed as a pending order in case the unlock-level was picked wrong. Thus I don´t pile up losing setups and lock-unlock cycles as you assume in order to "prove" that then my system will fail. You did everything to "prove" your point and you constantly invented scenarios which have no relevance to my method as I described it from the start. We know that already, but although you proved that my method is superior within the context I presented it, you still keep on trying your best to make it look bad. Then you turn around and accuse me of not being interested in your comparisons and your fabricated scenarios which have no relevance to the topic. Open a H4 chart, use the method 60minuteman teaches and show me more than 2 or 3 bad setups. And why 1:1 RR ? Why not trailing the thing or use a MA or fractals or other methods to exit ? Oh I know. Somehow you need that 1:1 RR to prove your point. But even if you only talk about 1:1, my method is superior to the losser methods in the context presented. Really ? Show me where they proved it on H4 with the method I mentioned. To me your postulates are not beyond doubt. Show me on a H4 chart please. Wrong. Because I don´t pile up new cycles at unlock-levels. You needed that assumption to "prove" your point, but it does not reflect what I trade. Your whole fabricated scenarios are useless and cannot be used in a sober comparison or discussion. Wrong. Again based on your wrong assumptions as usual. In real life I don´t get 10 losses in a row and with the lock-unlock method those 2 or 3 that might happen will not bother me because I just have to wait and the market will let me ride them to breakeven or a profit. No way to get -55 % . Your really need to fabricate everything to "prove" your point. Now it is getting ridiculous. Using 10% risk per trade. Come on. Are you a real trader, LazyPawn ? Even if Kelly or Obama or the Pope would prove it mathematically that I would be more profitable with a 10% risk per trade, I still would not do it. And 99.9999999999 % of the other traders wouldn´t do it either. Oh yes, on a demo account. Oh boy. What a tremendous adventure, trading with virtual money. There you can bet 50 % too. That would get you ahead if your bet wins. Why don´t you ask yourself why you cannot just admit what is obvious ? Instead you are constantly inventing fantasy scenarios to prove your point. Wrong. Based on wrong and unrealistic assumptions. But we know your way of "arguing" already, right ? On the contrary, it is not doomed to failure but is successfull if done right. Cannot be done by a noob, we already established the requirements. Yeah, of course. Simply increasing your bet size and not allowing to call that "martingale". But I will not increase my lot-size and many who already lost live accounts neither. Only nanningbob and a few others who know what they do and have sound MM can increase lot-sizes and not losing their accounts. For most other traders it is the road to their personal margin call. Yes, why ? And why do you make up fantasy scenarios to "win the argument" and then turn around to give universal advice which does not fit to my method ? Since you seem to have an understanding of human psychology, I challenge you to analyze your behavior and your way of debating in this thread. I gave you many hints. Why do you put lock-unlock and martingale and recovery in the same basket, LazyPawn ? We don´t need an answer from you because we know how you tick. Lock-Unlock works, you have proven it yourself. Martingale and recovery works too in a strongly limited method proven by nanningbob and others. So what are you ranting about, LazyPawn ? Your universal advice does not fit to us, it is besides the point. It has its place outside of our methods and nobody doubts that, maybe some newbies. So your universal advice should be addressed to them, not being used as a tool to discredit successfull and well thought trading methods. See you. Regards

At least if your going to quote me use my name. It's OK... I like what LazyPawn has to say. He is obviously a much more experienced trader than you. The bottomline is fxtr51 is that the SL crowd will always win in the end. May I suggest that you learn how to emotionally take a loss. Start with the fact that your fighting a losing argument. You lose get used to it. ITS OK TO LOSE... May I quote an anonymous trading legend " This reminds me of the guy who jumps off a tall building and on the way down says "So far so good" Yes your NO SL is working so far.... You see LazyPawn, myself and all others who know how to trade with a stoploss know with 100% certainity you will fail trading like you do. Now head on over to 60minutemans thread and his skype room and learn how the feck to use a SL. It aint that hard sunshine. BTW...Beautiful day in Vancouver today time to go out and enjoy the sunshine. Cheers, Bluesteele

--- 帖子 #209 ---
One more thing before i go.... FXTR51 you say your system has maximum 2 or 3 losing signals in a row. Here have a towel to wipe the water off behind your ears. That says alot about your trading knowledge and experience. You are dead wrong. I dont care whos system you throw out for an example either but every system will have at some point more than 3 losing signals in a row. I dont give a rats ass what any baccktesting says. It will. Don't forget your towel sonny. Blue

This completely makes sense to me as I sometimes employ the same strategy. Most people want a mechanical system, and this does not fit the definition. It actually involves position management... One good trader once said: "I don't trade, I manage margin."

fxtr51, would you mind to go over your past trades and look for your longest lock/unlock cycle and explain here in detail how you traded out of your floating loss? we would all learn a great deal and will stop all the critics. thank you euclid: sorry, I dont think you understand.........its called a hedge!

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Yes trading out of floating losses... An absolute firecracker of an idea. Something every Noob should learn. Yes...please show us...how to trade out of floating losses..So we can all burn out our compounding calculators calculating the riches too come ! hmmmmmmm.... I believe the great recovery artist known as Nanningbob has already wrote a booklet on it. Just dont mention the dirty word MARTINGALE... he prefers the much more politically correct Recovery. He gets kinda cranky when you mention the "M" word.....

--- 帖子 #214 ---
At the surface, yes. But there is a whole world behind that statement, something you have to think very hard to be able to discover.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I disagree. If you are not consistently profitable, nothing in this world will get you out of a floating loss. To the contrary, the loss will become larger. If you are profitable, and you know what you're doing, then next to other methods, fading out of it is one way.. Here's the problem. If you hedge it is very important to ask the question: Why am I hedging? If the answer is "out of fear" you may as well close the loser and move on. Most traders are overleveraged, and when the market moves swiftly against them they hedge as a "pause" strategy. That's not going to solve the problem... On the other hand, if you use SL, that in itself is an art, contrary to what's being thought out there... One can not have a fixed SL amount for instance, because the market expands and contracts and what works now will not work for the next trade (the same applies for TP). One can not say I'll set my SL below support because that's exactly what fuels the reverse. How many times you set a SL, the Market takes it out and then it reverses in your original direction? If you want to be successful you have to be able to buy weakness and sell strength. There's simply no way around it and I know, it's the hardest thing to do because it's completely counter intuitive. Unfortunately there are no set rules, nothing you can buy or steal to make you successful and we can argue here until we're blue in the face. The only way to success is thousands and maybe tens of thousands of hours behind the screens. This is a game of endurance, psychological strength and gut feeling pretty much..Quantify that if you can.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
thank you esprit for your words and for the link you provided. I actually trade for small TP only because it is quicker to reach. Trading for 15 pips allows me to close trades sooner and free again my margin so I can open new ones, whereas if I aimed at lets say 250 pips, I maybe would have to wait some days/weeks, and floating losses already take this long to reach tp.. so I prefer to lock in quickly as many small trades as I can. Thanks also to the other experienced traders that I see now debating over different MM techniques and I am following with interest. Well that was what I was hoping for when I started the thread, so I can learn more on how to manage the risk with no set SL.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi Nacho, very nice to meet you As to leverage, iwjw's right - no leverage means your trading 1:1. As to your way of trading, I've been working on it for more than ten years, I will help you to learn much more about what you are doing.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I think the back and forth between fxtr51 and LazyPawn, together with LazyPawn's excellent pdf and contributions from other experienced traders makes things extremely clear to any novice trader considering following these types of strategies and ways of thinking. They may appear less painful than using more traditional methods but it's only delaying the inevitable far worse pain. I really can't understand why some people have a need to try and reinvent the wheel but stubbornly insist on using a square template, totally disregarding all the mathematical and logical evidence right in front of them. Being unable to accept the patently obvious is not a good trait for a trader but it goes some way to understanding why these nedge/recovery/lock/unlock/etc strategies exist and why they're so attractive to some novices who haven't yet managed to grasp the basics of trading.

Excellent post Atilla ! I agree with you 100%. Blue

--- 帖子 #224 ---
It's funny we argue about so many things on this forum when actually nobody is right and nobody is wrong just as a coin flip with appropriate MM is a perfectly valid strategy.. I gave up arguing about strategies some time ago, and I prefer to post naked women while shooting crap at the other thread where trading actually comes second. Trading is a mind fuck, it's what it is.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Atilla, buy weakness and sell strength: ie buying at support and selling at resistance? buying after a pull back and selling after the trend resumed if thats the case I dont understand why that would be counter intuitive, because dont we all like to buy stuff at a discount? what about people who buy high on a breakout and sell higher (not buying weakness) what you are suggesting could also be counter trading: selling overbought, buying oversold. could you go into it a bit more?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
It can be sliced and diced ten thousand ways. My personal preference is to buy after support was broken and sell after resistance was taken. i.e after stops were cleared. One other thing I'm looking at, the Market never reverses before it screws both longs and shorts first(in a dowtnrend for example, late shorts and early longs). If you ask me to explain it EXACTLY, I can't. If you ask me how I trade, I can't tell you exactly either except that I use two different methods(market profile and some gann) to establish a bias, and then the entries are pretty much what I said above. The only indicators I use is RSI and 200 ema and a ketlner channel (lately). Talking about discount.. yes I agree. However most want confirmation. Now you have to chose. You want confirmation (pullback, etc) then your potential loss is higher if you're wrong but there is a smaller chance to be wrong. Less confirmation, higher risk, smaller loss.. You have to find a balance, whatever each one of us is comfortable with.

Let's not derail the thread. Btw, I think his method works, but only in demo where trading psychology does not take over. I've done it, but I was never able to make it work when money was involved. Bummer...

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi again, Nacho I am 57 years old, 15 of which spent in currency trading or very close to it - imagine what a long story I have behind me. Working in a similar way you are working, counting opened/closed trades since July 15, 2011 I have these numbers: total 700 - profit 700 - loss 0. It works! Leaving behind what is going on in the thread started by you, you remind me myself, only many years ago, when I had in my head approximately the same portion of knowledge and understanding you have now in yours. There is a long distance between us at this very moment, but I cannot see anyone else on this road except you and me, that's why I am real eager to help you catch up with me. Very important: everything I am going to tell you is based on facts or taken from my own experience. If you kindly agree to accept my help, I would offer two ways to start our cooperation for your choice: 1. if you believe and trust me at once, I can explain what mistakes you have already made, we will eliminate them (the moment you understand you've made a mistake you have to get rid of it, whatever the cost), and you will start doing right things later today, when the market opens. For this, I will need to know the two trades you are still in plus some other minor details about the terms you trade with. I can give you a number of trades which are very close to TP for the upcoming week. If this will be your choice, we will further be communicating in a question-answer format while doing what we need to on our accounts. 2. Or you may want to first know the background of it all, in which case you have to be prepared for some lecturing (but in no case mentoring) from my side. Whatever your reply may be, I sincerely wish you all luck in trading.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
That's nice... Like I said. I've done it in demo and it worked fine. 60 trades in a month, 0 losers, but then I screwed it up with the live account... I do know there is something there but people are quick to discard new ideas. No wonder most lose at this game. As a matter of fact, this is how I've got involved in forex even before I knew you could trade. I had two accounts one in usd one in euro and I was moving all the money from one to the other maybe two times a year. 1:1 leverage if you will. It takes a round trip to see profit, but I made about 15K in maybe two round trips without having a clue about trading..

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Nacho, Most of what you have shared offers good potential. This part though might be concerning: Even when the trade reverses on me and goes -200/-300 pips against me, the fact that I'm not using the leverage, makes it affordable (you can whitstand such a reversal with no leverage and still open other trades!) The only bad thing is that a trade can stay open for days or weeks before reaching TP. But as I could see by testing, more than 90% of trades reach TP within 48 hrs. Personally, not sure I like getting 15 or 20 pips within 48 hours, but I think the rest of your approach makes good sense. Regards, FX4 P.S. Continue on your journey and find your system that works for you. I am sure DedMatvey could work with you to help refine what you've got. Go for it.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Ha, I did the exact same before the explosion of online trading platforms and leverage, except more frequently than twice a year! Transaction costs were high and spread, well, spread was out the wazoo, 2 and 3c! Execution was painfully laborious and settlement seemed to take forever! Ah the memories, we don't realize how lucky we are now!

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Of course it works, anyone can hold a trade for as long as it takes to turn profitable, it's even easier in the ranging market we've seen over the past 3+ years or so. As I understand it only half of your 700 trades were live. Aside from that, you left out the most important numbers, risk and reward (return). I'm extremely sceptical about strategies like this simply because I have never seen one which is viable, acceptably productive compared to traditional trading methods, or which has survived long one-way trends. Having said that I'm always open to new ideas but so far it's just been the same old same old regurgitated 'stuff'.......

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hello DedMatvey! Thanks a lot for your support!I believe in this way of trading and knowing that there are experienced traders that think the same makes me more confident about its success. So I am very willing to hear your suggestions and try to make my way more reliable. If you could also tell me where do you think I am mistaken now it surely will be useful as well.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi, Well i'm talking about 15/20 pips per each trade, if they close fast I open new ones, max 5 at once, I lock in on average about 65/90 pips every 1 or 2 days, which is small money now that I trade 0.01, but not bad either!

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi Indrek, Could you please tell me in a little more detail about what you do to open and close your trades? I will tell you about my ways and what they are based on. Let it be a start of the discussion inside our very small group. Who knows, with one trader a day joining, what a team can we grow?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Nacho, 1. OANDA is not the best broker for your method, 1;50 leverage will only allow you to think of how to make a few pips per day. Have you calculated about how long it will take you to reach 2,000 eur? My standpoint is: a professional trader should think in terms of monthly then yearly percentage adding to the initial deposit, rather than pips. For example, if you settle, say, on 8.5% monthly, you can easily calculate your progress - 1mln/10 years. You can never build a plan with pips. 2. Your Entry Condition: LONG when H4 PA closes above 5EMA SHORT when H4 PA closes below 5EMA And your comment: The only bad thing is that a trade can stay open for days or weeks before reaching TP. What I think: these two have nothing to do with each other, it is like trying to turn on a hard rock piece at a concert of classical music. Your mistake: you are trying to use 4hr charts in decision making process for the probable period of days and even weeks. How come? If you tell me it is good because you have 27 TP trades out of total 29, I will say that you have been lucky so far, but luck can turn its back on you any moment. For example, you say you allow yourself to have no more than 5 trades open at the same time, now you already have two (both minus), what if those minus trades start accumulating and reach your limit of five? It will mean your work frozen, with the rollovers successfully eating up your money. Will H4 PA/5EMA help you? 3. You say: I try to compensate for the negative rollovers by entering in trades with positive rollovers (for example long on AUDUSD). It's extremely dangerous and, again, has nothing to do with your method. I am sure you know that all the pairs with good positive rollovers are close to their highs, then why are you trying to buy AUDUSD? The moment you do it you destroy all the basics of your approach as you can only cope with AUDUSD at these highs with a stoploss. Summing up, I have explained how I see what you are doing, but it is only my point of view, if you can clearly explain things to yourself and feel you understand them all right, then don't listen to anyone and keep moving your way.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi pipmutt, Perhaps it will be a new idea to you if I say the following: my strong belief is that RISK MANAGEMENT IN CURRENCY TRADING is not a highly scientific or psychological something, it is just one side of our everyday life, like many others. In our ordinary life we calculate risks hundreds of times every day (when crossing a street, for example) to stay rational in our decision making on this or that matter. This process never stops. We are all very well used to it. Only one problem: the moment we are mistaken we get into trouble... Is it anyhow different from FX? Then why do we separate currency trading from the rest of our lives, what makes it so special? My answer is NOTHING. My coclusion is: if one can manage risks in all other situations, why cannot one manage risks here?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
glad to know that you found each other. Please keep us in the loop and let us know how your trading benefit from each others experience. I am curious. Hope you will prove that holy grail does exits in Forex. Wishing you all the success.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Mechanization of good reason sets a technical edge; mechanization of what interferes with good reason allows edge to go as far as discretion allows it. Using an mm to follow through on either, only works if one has the chance to use a good reason before loss is incurred. Increasing one's edge increases capture size and shortens both hold time and the number of times a loss is incurred. Thus, I'd rather work on my edge -- given I've mechanized my thoughts and actions to allow through good reason -- than discuss different mm's. Each to their own, though. It is interesting to read the mm experts' advice.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi DedMatvey I agree, it shouldn't be, nevertheless it's a big psychological issue for some people who find it difficult to condition themselves to accept a decision was wrong and to take a loss, that's why strategies like the one in this thread exist, purely to try and compensate for a psychological shortcoming and borne out of trading ignorance and inexperience. Good question, why do some people find it difficult. In our normal day-to-day lives we are constrained by boundaries, obligations, socially acceptable behaviour, laws, and some things are just the accepted norm ie looking when crossing the street. In trading it's different, we're free to do more or less exactly as we please without any boundaries or obligations, we alone have to decide what is sensible and acceptable and what isn't, and we're totally responsible for maintaining our own discipline, there's no one threatening punishment, nannying us, or helping us avoid acting irresponsibly as in our normal day-to-day lives. That, I believe, is a significant difference. -

--- 帖子 #241 ---
This is what nanningbob always tells me. That "I don't understand" or "I keep assuming incorrectly" when all I have done is provide empirical evidence that trading without stop loss is not more profitable long term nor safer.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Strike 1 Strike 2 Strike 3. You're outta here! All you're doing is playing a mind game with yourself. If doing it this way helps you stay organized, then fine that's one thing, but I don't see how this helps. It's confusing really. Also as Hanover explained, a second position "locking" the first position, would result in an overall negative swap. Therefore IT IS better to close out completely and reenter again. Simple math proves this beyond all doubt.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Your strategy is quite interesting. Can you give me an invest password from any of your account to see how it works and what profit you get.

This ideaology is quite possibly the biggest fallacy amongst inexperienced traders. Unrealized or realized, the equity is gone from your Net Asset Value. What many beginners don't realize is that by leaving it open they could lose more! If you're wrong it shouldn't take long to know. If you're wrong get out before the whole ship sinks.

Hi DedMatvey, I've read your post on the other thread. Actually I am interested in understanding your way of trading and to know abt record high/lows you found. My first answer maybe was a bit incomplete. Could you explain further your way of trading and how to read correctly the excel chart you posted? Thanks

--- 帖子 #249 ---
It is simple why I keep saying you dont understand. Your argument is always two fold. 1) You will say you will blow up your account. I counter but that will take over 50K pips to do that. So I wont. Low or no leverage beats your argument every time. 2) Then you say, You cant make money trading that small. But I do. Winners are winner are winners. A high percentage win rate beats your argument every time. That is the skill part you ignore. 3) Then you say, You will blow up your account. I counter but that will take over 50K pips to do that. So I wont. 4) Then you say, You cant make money trading that small. But I do. 5) Then you say ................................ and on and on and on it goes. Why do I say you dont understand?? Because you keep debating out of both sides of your mouth. That shows you dont comprehend either side of the argument or you wouldnt keep arguing the same dead points. You state you have empirical evidence, I have real live evidence backed by years of trading. Real actual evidence trumps your empirical evidence. You fail to recognize that alternative trading styles can be and have been successful. They are also a mastered skill. So here we go again. 1) You will say you will blow up your account. I counter but that will take over 50K pips to do that. So I wont. Low or no leverage beats your argument every time. 2) Then you say, You cant make money trading that small. But I do. Winners are winner are winners. A high percentage win rate beats your argument every time. That is the skill part you ignore. 3) Then you say, You will blow up your account. I counter but that will take over 50K pips to do that. So I wont. 4) Then you say, You cant make money trading that small. But I do. 5) Then you say ................................ and on and on and on it goes. If you understood it you would say, I can see how that works but I wouldnt trade that way. But we know that aint going to happen. I will state again for the record for the thousandths time: I use percentages for my SL or recovery not pip amounts but that is ok. I know that has never sunk in either. I still remember you making a fool of yourself in my trend trading section telling everyone to beware of no SL Bob. They knew better and wondered what you had been smoking.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I'm using ALPARI as broker now which allows me to trade micro lots. If I'm able to lock in 5/6% of my margin every month, then it will take me 16/20 months to double my account...which is the slowest step, as I start to trade bigger lots, the time I need to increase the margin should decrease significantly. You are correct, this is the main problem, If I happen to have 5 trades all with floating losses then the whole process stops and I have to wait for at least one to close. This will hamper my road to the monthly target of 5/6% of margin. I'm trying to understand ways to counterbalance those floating losses such as those posted by other traders here in this thread. What are your suggestions? Yes, AUDUSD is close to its historical high....it seems a very volatile pair with frequent big swings though, so it should reach my tp at somepoint. Using this method implies that I have to accept the fact that I will often have open position for days/weeks, hence, I have to manage negative rollovers somehow. How do you manage this?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi Nacho, I hope you will find the below helpful Well, WHY GROUPS? 1.Everybody knows that the main principle of trading is: BUY LOW/SELL HIGH. But with the average of 30(+/-) most offered by brokerage companies currency pairs you can wait for months or even years to see a high or low of an individual pair. That is why people HAVE to trade the way they do now, i.e. buying/selling miles from high/low - I agree that in trading like this the stoploss is simply necessary/obligatory. Just a very different matter with pairs' combinations which are theoretically countless in number (I have tried way over twenty thousand in the course of work, left 4,555 for my current collection). The more data/statistics you have for studying something the bigger is a chance you will find what you are looking for. With my groups, I have average of 15 to 50 (depending on how volatile the previous trading week was) high/low opportunities (less than 50 distance to the high/low on my chart) every weekend (this is when I do my preparation work for the upcoming week). 2.I am sure that between anything that moves and can make up a group (ants, bees, human beings, currencies, etc.) do exist some relations. So, I was very keen on finding, studying and understanding relations in currency groups I was making up and watching. At first, I was going to use 100 parameters to do that. But the number turned out to have been taken from nowhere, and eventually I had to take most of those parameters out and was left with only 43 ones. I have been working with these 43 parameters non-stop ever since. * example of what my parameters are: what distance a group covers per day (average)/how fast it moves(intraday)/whether it reverses direction after a short time or keeps moving in one direction for a longer period(days/weeks)/current rollovers, etc. I have those in a special table of my own design, with all the parameters being divided into two parts, which I call majors and minors. This table is very helpful in selecting 3 to 8 the most attractive opportunities out of 15 to 50 mentioned above and seen on my charts/single bars. Plus, I have a table of ratings for the groups which I have already had experience with in live market conditions (opened and closed). This one helps in minor matters, for example when I have two or more very similar opportunities to consider and I am not certain which one to choose. Everything described above serves only one purpose -- to find one or a few combinations of currency pairs, which I am sure can do no harm to my deposit = to trade. Lucky days to you.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I would give it a rest. Seriously. There are people whose heads simply explode if anybody attacks their beloved stop loss. They simply discard the low or no average part of the discussion (because their head is already scattered to pieces). Just let them be, with their stop loss being popped on a regular basis..This thread will not go anywhere because of that so I think nacho and DedMatvey should just find another mean of communication. I strongly believe that most of what is being thought out there is garbage, and never works. As I mentioned in one of the posts before, one of my main strategies is to enter a trade after the stop losses are being cleared. I always watch the chart and ask where are the stop losses. I want to see them popped, and then I trade.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
lol, ever since the error of his ways was pointed out to him he is using a stop loss! Keep up there attila, you're lagging the rest of the class! See, at least now he has some form of risk management! Ok the rest of it is pretty 'out there' but hey, there's more than one way to skin a cat!

I understand, but we all use a SL at some point and end a trade. We all do that or should. After years of playing with this stuff I have found that around 1% you are probably better off killing the trade. That is my limit but I have violated that limit if I think the fundamentals are with me. If you really think about it. A guy who trades 3 million or 30 million or more at a time is not trading with a 30 or 50 pip SL nor is he highly leveraged. He is most likely trading 1:1 or 2:1. He breaks up his trading amount, lets say 3 million for an example, into several sections, lets say three and will enter the market at 1 million. If the trade is successful he will add to that position. If he thinks his analysis is wrong he will kill the trade. If he thinks his analysis is right but entered too early, he will look for his next best spot to reenter with another million trade. He keeps a third to add later. It is done all the time, all you have to do to believe this and know it is true it to look at a COT chart. One group is almost always trading the opposite of the other two. You think they arent trading multiple levels and stages. You think if they made a mistake they wont hedge their trade and wait for a better entrance or exit. Since they arent leveraged they dont have swap costs. I dont know what these SL guys are smoking but they havent met these guys. That I can tell you is a fact. Just go study a COT chart, you can see they do it.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I know exactly what your are saying. My SL is = my believing in the trade. When the trust is gone, the trade is gone. I do watch the COT too, but I mostly pay attention to the large commercials (which btw are short eur/usd at the moment).. Edit: The market feeds off stop losses. One thing is missing in this discussion: We are allowed to trade for a very simple reason. To provide liquidity. Nothing else.

Commonly called scaling in or averaging in, but don't forget those guys are chasing liquidity all the time, we aren't. That's one big advantage retail traders have, instant fills with very little (if any) slippage. Hedge it, perhaps. Nedge it, never! There's always interest on cash, leveraged or not.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
bob, ecactly there is the problem. He has no empirical evidence. He has a locked mind and is defending his beliefs only. Yes. I have no doubts about that. But I seriously doubt he has made those profits you made all those years. Because only a few percent of both parties have that success. His beliefs don´t allow him to think against them. Rather he will fight for his "convictions" forever. We have such fights in science, politics and especially religions. Only proves that mankind is not developed enough to live in peace.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
2+2=4, a little hint for you: The debate with LazyPawn was not about comparing different trading styles in a sober manner. It was a fight of 2 egos because one did not dignify the other. Remember ? 5 setups. 4 hit SL. 1 hits TP. Losser: -1 , -1 , -1 , -1 , +1 = - 3 Locker: 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , +1 = +1 Instead of simply accepting this basic math, he tried to prove something which was besides the point and after he insulted me, he got his knockout from me. I could have avoided the debate if I would have said: Ok, you don´t understand nor accept that simple math. That is ok for me. Now tell me what is on your mind. Then his ego would have been flattered and he would have been happy and not insulting me. Right ? Therefore both are responsible for the fight. The conclusion for me is this: Trading it with lock-unlock ( under the premise I outlined ) is profitable. Trading with SL is profitable too if you know how to trade profitable. 95% don´t , although they religiously use SL. How come ? My method can only be traded profitably if you have experience, patience and discipline. Same applies to SL taking. It is a matter of preference only. For one party to say: " No, our method is the only one, the other is crap and nonsense and will kill your account etc." is not true. It is like the Roman Catholic Church which claims they are the only ones and all others are cults and will go to hell. Such wrong dogma only fuel strife and the worst in mankind.

Stoplosses are the most highly promoted and punted lessons given out by every single retail fx broker there is . Why you may ask , well its there biggest moneymaker along with a good lashing of leverage.Ever asked yourself what would hapen if say for the next 6 months every single retail trader removed his S/L and lowered his leverage down to as near as 1:1 as possible ie very small lots? Every single retail broker would go out of business. evan with leverage ,they would shit themselves. "Dont forget your S/L chaps" Werever you look. and whobetied anybody that goes against the norm , you get ridiculed and slandered by so called experts (probably FX broker moles)Given the nature of the fx mkt the chances of your 20-50 pip s/l being taken out are huge.Take say a 30 pip stop on any major, mark it with a coulored rectangle and then go back in history to say as far back as when the euro came into play , look and see how many times price crossed that band?? plenty. The same goes for a take profit. So what iam saying is,find a suitable pair that is not at the top or bot. of its range, find a good entry bassed on your own style of trading, make sure you have enough margin to carry u to bot/top end of chart , a healthy t/p and walk away without a knot in your stomach , knowing full well that youve just fucked your broker up the arse and there s nothing he can do about it.You` ve also crossed the floor from being a leveraged gambler to a investment trader .Remeber what FX trading is about, changeing one curr. for another , waiting for it to rise in value ,then changing it back, if u did this at the airport kiosk u would have no problem if it sat in your pocket for 6 mnths , so do the same on your fx acc. Remeber for 2 strong currencies to have a good tradeing agreement for exports etc they have to remain in a state of equilibreium to trade ,hence the yo-yo effect or zig zag, price will allways come back guys if u are caught on the wrong side . the pain u choose to inflict apon youself depends on your leverage

Well not quite! Your argument seems to base itself solely around the premise that an unrealized loss is not really a loss, a spurious argument to say the least, have you never heard of the terms 'mark to market' or 'net asset value'? LazyPawn, hanover, and numerous other experienced traders have tried to explain this and other things to you patiently, quietly, with diagrams, examples, and even a pdf! You, and a few others, seem to have failed to grasp some very simple concepts. Have you learned nothing from the recent financial meltdown? Institutions also kept floating losses hidden and declared everything was fine, and everything did appear fine until they were forced to mark to market and the proverbial hit the fan! Lesson learned? Seems not.....

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Wrong. Read again until you understand. I will not take the time to repeat it all specially for you. It is all there .... And remember: -3 % is not equal to +1 % , that is what LazyPawn and you and others from the SL-party never understood and still haven´t. Thus you bicker continuously into the wrong direction. Yes, that is a very good point. Very very good, because why should a sober and intelligent trader with an open mind fight methods which are profitable ? I am adding a similar thought which hasn´t been mentioned yet: A forum makes more money for each click somebody makes. It is a simple necessity so to speak to have broker moles or other moles who start a fight here or there , to provoke, to offend if necessary to keep the debates going, to heaten them up, to fuel them .... because that translates into cash. Of course FF is not like other forums. Here are no moles , only honest and well meaning members. What a relief to know that, right ?

Pleasure ,dont actualy trade fx,did originaly but i now only do the indexes mainly our jse alsi top 40 . fx is the biggest retail scam out if u have to leverage to make it work.Remeber if they punting it ,its for a reason. our Alsi moves on average 300 /600 pips/point a day, here if i get it wrong i have to hedge quickley as iam on a -+ 1:12 leverage . I also only trade the direction of the daily gaps.

A few years ago I trusted a "super forex trader", he had a good website and he was one of the best Elliott-Wave experts. He managed my live-account and there we went: Somehow his analysis was correct 99%, so for example he opened a Short .... and set a SL at the last swing High + a few Pips for spread and safety. You would not believe it ( not you, Jse Alsi, because you know the dirty game ) , but almost every time the market first spiked up and got his SL, the price dropped like a stone shortly afterwards. He lost almost every setup with his SL and even when he put his SL further away the broker hunted it. That was one of the biggest brokers, I won´t name it for obvious reasons. End of story: after he ruined my live account almost completely, I set a new password and he was out and I told him that I would not use his services any longer. The SL-believers will say: No , no, no. Always place a SL and take your loss and move on.

Hey bluesteele, I just went to the thread you recommended. Great. It just cleared everything up. Look: Maybe you missed it. If you don´t agree, then please make a PDF with all quotes from that thread which seem to support your SL-belief, but don´t forget: - 3 % is not equal to + 1 % . And don´t forget that the no sl methods are proven in real life while you have only theory which doesn´t fit to reality for your claims. Click, click, click .....

I have spent already quite a lot of time on that thread. I think you are losing the focus here. The main point in this thread is NOT whether using a SL is good or bad, I did not mean to revamp the old battle SL vs no SL. The method I am using and I am trying to develop with the help of those who want to take what I wrote in the first post as a starting point, is in great part based on not using a predefined SL as the title of the thread might suggest. You might not like it, but that's it. So we should get past this SLvsnoSL thing because here the option of using the SL have been already discarded from the very beginning.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thanks DedMatvey, I would like to know more about your strategy if you dont mind. You said you find buy/sell opportunities based on a set of parameters you defined could you go further into that and into the excel spreadsheet you set up? Another question is: How do you design the currency groups you trade? Problem I find is that for example if I open positions where USD is inside, I am relying basically on the performance of USD against the others so if i go long on lets say audusd, euruds and gbpusd, and USD drops, I generally have floating losses on all these 3 open position, so I have to for the USD to "recover" in order to close all three. Therefore I am trying to diversify the positions I open, but that sometimes means higher spreads .

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Exactly, well said nancho ,if u dont like it move on , all iam trying to say is predefined s/l will get taken out by mkt rythum , ask 95% of all retail fx traders , they all use s/l . Start thinking out the box a bit people , u are being herded like sheep into useing predefined crap that cannot hold up against big money moves . Not having a s/l doesnt mean u have to hold onto a trade come hell or high water , if u think its wrong then u get the hell out or hedge it but dont let your fucking broker decide for u with a s/l . Ntural rythym of mkt will take out any 30/50 pip s/l .Learn to see how and why the mkt moves up and down on a daily bases,moveing in a predefined up or down TREND and i can assure you my friend you will have the goose .

--- 帖子 #285 ---
lol, 95% don't lose because they use a stop, they lose because they have no concept of trading! You don't like your brøker much do you! Mine is my best friend, he facilitates my trading, and the market offers endless opportunities, all I have to do is take them. Your trading sounds like you go to war with the market and your brøker every day, whereas I go to work as a trader, I know which I prefer!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Yes, and when a sl-trader is placing a SL because he believes in it and he is doing according to what the SL-believers is teaching their followers, he is called an "idiot" and "display of trading ineptness" . That makes so much sense and that´s why 95 % lose part or all of their money. Stoploss hunting is fact. The brokers have software for it. Whoever is calling this a "conspiracy theory" is either a complete newbie or he is a broker mole or maybe something else is wrong with him. Click, click, click Nacho, of course your method works .... if you place a hedge at a certain level or take the loss. That way you will never lose your account. It is so obvious and simple. I have shown you that lock-unlock works fine too. Allows me to trade with 1% initial risk or higher. That´s all. Since you are the thread starter, why don´t you ban the hijackers and only allow those who contribute in a usefull way ?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Fair enough, so the only problem you say you've got is.... Unfortunately you've tested out your strategy for a very short period in a ranging market, ie optimal market conditions for a strategy like this. The problem you say you're worried about, and that you will eventually face, is that price might go against you for a long period of time and tie up your valuable equity, have I got that right? One 'solution' to your problem that I can see (and it's not really a solution, it's more of a mind pacifier for people who can't stomach a loss) is to reduce exposure on the losing position(s) as you make money on your winning position(s), thereby your equity remains the same and it doesn't feel like you've taken a loss. The whole exercise is slightly pointless as you'll be more or less treading water but hey ho. Another choice might be to look at options and such as a hedge rather than some inane idea about freezing or locking losses by having positions of equal size in opposite directions on the same pair! You do know why they call it 'nedging', right? Neither are really solutions, the bottom line is you would be infinitely better off learning to trade and adjusting your thinking to that of a trader, but you're adamant you want to go with it so.......I think we were all adamant we had the grail in the early stages of our trading and we ignored what turned out to be sensible advice, it just took us time and money to prove to ourselves that we were in fact wrong. It's a good educational exercise as long as you don't lose too much money! I wish you well in your endeavour but it wouldn't sit well with me to help someone put their hand in the fire when I know what the inevitable outcome will be. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
We live in hope!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I trade my own system that is just regular trading but with hedging instead of SL. First, I pause the losing trade with opposite equal order of the same pair. Later I take decision what to do next. For example, I may use other pairs to get out of the hedge. Pairs that are correlated to the initial one. And, of course, I am taking other trades at the time when the hedge is not yet solved.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi Indrek, Sorry, but I am far from this method, so I am feeling confused to give my comments, simply don't know what to say... I think, if you feel happy about your gains, why go somewhere else? If you think you can find something of use in my approach, I have already placed a few posts on it, some in this thread, some more in &gt;Trading Discussion&gt; Are you a consistently profitable trader?&gt; I am open for inquiries, so feel free to come with any questions you may have. All the best.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I would suggest this method negates the main thing that makes trading so attractive: limited risk / unlimited profits..... ....and hedging a negative position will most times delay the inevitable.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Are you the Pope ? He says " We " but he means himself.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
You have no obligation to comment on my method. Just you asked how I manage my trades and I answered. I trade mostly 4 hour charts now. Used to trade lower but then realized that spending my life behind the charts is the most stupid thing to do. Now I can take care of trading with 30-40 minutes per day and that's it. Mathematically, hedging is the same than using SL but for me SL seems too simple. I can do better than just write off the losses. Besides, it is fun to play with open positions, combine and recombine them. If to refine the entries and to set BE at proper times, only maybe 10% of trades appear to be losers and need hedging. It is not much, these trades just run at the background and do not mess anything up. Entries are the key to success for me, everything else is beauty of game and matter of technical (mathematical) skill.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
i dont understand why you dont look at lazypawns post,its very clear, ive tested for 18 months a no stop loss systems.the maths will amaze you. long term its not possible. the fact not one post here suggests what you need to do to defy this realism,tells me your all wasting your time and money. let me say this,if you close 1 loosing trade it may have a positive or negative effect longterm on the overall result,but its pure luck as to wether that 1 trade you closed at a loss would infact have been a positive closing trade to skew the overall outcome.you would not know,hence the end result when this whole sequence finishes would be unown.you have to know what your trying to do by trading with no stops period.otherwise how can you gain a positive outcome. for anybody who understands this,ill give you a clue as to were you maybe able to skewer the sequence .hedging initself just delays the outcome and you will still not know if the outcome is positive or negative.look at hedging were you limit the risk on your loss side and stand to cover the drawdown on your floating loss trades,then you maybe able to adjust the outcome

Dear Fellow Traders, To my shame, I start feeling bored staying in this thread because I have the strong feeling that we are turning what was initially a very interesting subject and thread into just a bla-bla show. Perhaps it is time to put an end to this? ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ As an alternative (I am applying now to all honorable ordinary traders of Nacho-Indrek-DedMatvey party), I suggest that we gather a group of volunteers, open demo accounts (one for each participant) and start trading the way we can next Monday. While trading, we can discuss whatever we think may be useful or interesting to us (we can start another thread for it). We will see what we will have after one month, exchange views/opinions on the results - thus, it will be easier for everyone to make up his/her mind about what to do further. Sincerely your friend.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I think that I will just stay quiet in the future... I trade for living and it is a bit strange for me to hear from demo traders that I am doing things absolutely wrong... I certainly do not recommend to trade without any SL. But hedging or not - it is matter of taste. Arguing about taste is senseless. I also understand that no br*ker can accept such method of managing trades. And will do everything possible to mess up threads like this one.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi Indrek, ...take care of trading with 30-40 minutes per day and that's it. even less in my case Mathematically, hedging is the same than using SL but for me SL seems too simple. ???????????????????for me Besides, it is fun to play with open positions, combine and recombine them. Do the same when think it's proper to be done, must be cautious with this. If to refine the entries and to set BE at proper times, only maybe 10% of trades appear to be losers and need hedging. It is not much, these trades just run at the background and do not mess anything up. I sometimes have a trade or two in the background, too.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Just need to have a proper account size that allows to keep trades even in deep floating loss if sth really bad happens. But best recipe is not to take stupid entries

Have been following this, excellent thread. Sounds like a reasonable idea Dedmatvey. Would be interesting to see the outcome of using or not using a stoploss, it sounds like Dedmatvey is certainly interested in running a demo and perhaps placing his results on here, and as such must be quite confident of his abilities, of course im sure one of the guys who have been so vocal on the need to use a stoploss will be more than willing to also take part, only takes a secong to place a demo trade after having first placed a live one so shouldnt get in the way of normal trading. Im quite looking forward to the results, would certainly go a long way to either prove or dissprove the method, although of course one month in trading isn't a particularly long time. M. M.

I meant that most probably many people in threads like this work for br*kers. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain why best threads are always killed quickly. Maybe just too many stupid people around, I do not know, but probably also clever ones asking stupid questions again and again. Or fighting directly against best ideas. Anyway, it is clear that threads that contain really working and profitable trading systems die very early while the longest and most popular ones are always full of BS only. That is why it is always wise to not reveal best ideas in anonymous places.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Some valid points for sure.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I'm sorry for your loss, but your money manager was just a bad trader. Unfortunately you learned nothing from that experience. See what you and the no SL bunch don't seem to understand is that you don't need a stop for a br0ker to take your money. Unrealized loss is a loss. Just because you don't close the trade out doesn't mean the br0ker hasn't gotten you. On the contrary you are playing the game right into his hands by allowing it to fall deeper into loss. Now if you truly believe the br0ker hunts stops, then why wouldn't you buy and sell simultaneously with the smaller position having a stop loss and the larger one not having a stop loss? Let the br0ker hunt your small trade's stop loss and close the bigger one for a profit at the same time the smaller one is stopped. Please explain why this would not work according to your theory.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
That is the fallacy that is so widely accepted. See trading is not easy nor was it meant to be. So when people fail there must be a reason, right? It can't be because I mismanaged my entry and exit. It must be because the damn broker hunted my stop. If that's the case then why couldn't the broker be fooled into chasing your smaller stops in order to cash in on your larger positions without a stop as I explained in the previous post? Furthermore, do you actually think the broker needs to hit your stop to take your money? If so, then try withdrawing your unrealized loss and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
5oo pips is too little...need to go for at least 1000 of cushion...and maybe both ways...and different pairs...and trade with Oanda , no lots but say 100 pieces...you need to calculate ...excell and more excell...in the end is posible, provided you start with tiny lots...(forget about micro lots unless you have 100000 in the account...) Market might move 5000 pips, slowly but surely....against you...it´s the name of the game...you will loose sleep if not carefull....

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Bob, it looks like your now totally confused. I will take responsibility for that. Please accept my apology. See I never once told you that you cannot make money without a stop loss. My whole argument has been that it is more profitable long term (and without more risk) if you trade with a stop loss - if you know what you are doing . It's simple math to explain this, let alone visualize. See when you are turning over trades of larger position size more frequently, the more you compound the earnings. And since they are more frequent and of larger size, the compounding is exponential. Compare that to a tiny little trade floating around in drawdown for what seems like forever until it hits your take profit. Sure you will get those trades that hit TP same day, but again they are tiny trades since you are prepared for the possibility of a large drawdown. This way is such a WASTE OF TIME! Again, not saying you can't ultimately reap profits, but it's not really worth the hassle or time, imo. That is why I always say you might as well put your money in fixed return instruments if you are going to trade that way. Anyway, getting back to why I feel responsible for twisting your mind up. Now you say you are cutting trades off at 1% with a position size that can withstand a 50K pip drawdown. Now that really makes no sense. If you are going to trade no stop loss then do it all the way. 1% drawdown on a position size that can withstand 50K pip drawdown is 500 pips, correct? Now you're really being inefficient with the use of your time. A 500 pip swing could take a few weeks or couple months. I suggest increasing the position size some and putting a shorter stop loss. You are going to get stopped out here and there. Yes that will happen! But if you enter and exit at good points consistently , you will make back any losses and some. Now watch someone call me a br0ker mole, lol.

In our normal day-to-day lives we are constrained by boundaries, obligations, socially acceptable behaviour, laws, and some things are just the accepted norm ie looking when crossing the street. In trading it's different, we're free to do more or less exactly as we please without any boundaries or obligations, we alone have to decide what is sensible and acceptable and what isn't, and we're totally responsible for maintaining our own discipline, there's no one threatening punishment, nannying us, or helping us avoid acting irresponsibly as in our normal day-to-day lives. That, I believe, is a significant difference. - [/quote] Hi pipmutt, Exactly what we have been seeing happening in this thread for the last few days. From what you are saying, isn't the solution for all our problems obvious? Get back to normal human morals and discipline and earn money trading currencies.

It's a pity to say this, but for the obvious reasons the thread stopped being interesting to me. Seeing no sense in following it any more, I am leaving. Those of who may want to join the group of participants to try a no-SL strategy on demo accounts for one month (whether under my guidance or not) pls use the private message service. If under my guidance, two conditions for choosing the right br*ker: 1. (Paramount importance) the account size/contract size ratio offered must be 1:2, for example 500/100 or 5,000/10,000, or 50,000/100,000. 2. (Important) that there be USD/SGD in the list of the pairs to trade. I wish lucky trades to everybody.

I cannot believe that "experienced" traders know nothing about virtual dealer plug-ins. Either they lie or they are just ignorant or something else is wrong with them. Interesting that only the SL-missionaries here ridicule it although it is fact. There is a reason for that and they know it but will never admit it. Nacho, please ban these guys. They are only here to destroy your thread. Interesting too that the very good Elliott Wave trader who managed my live account, was losing most of his setups using StopLoss exactly how using StopLoss is taught by the whole SL-crowd and their gurus. And even more interesting that I had my live-account at Gain Capital back then. Only thing: back then I didn´t know about the Virtual Dealer Desk plugin and nobody else did until the NFA published their findings. It is interesting too that the SL-missionaries here badmouth that excellent trader for doing exactly what they are here to teach: for placing a SL at a reasonable level .... because no broker ever used nor ever will practice STOP HUNTING they say. No, it never ever happened on this earth and the NFA just invented that mysterious Dealer plugin software. They fabricated a conspiracy theory only, right ? And now the SL-missionaries continue to ricidule everybody who has better knowledge about what is happening in Forex than they have. They are spamming this thread with pictures and make very much noise to obscure the facts. If you want to read more of that stuff, google "naughty-brokers-busted-forex" and you will find the article. If you google some more, you will find the offers where the virtual dealer plugin is sold. They offer several modules for different "needs" of the broker. Hehehe, the "conspiracy theory" of the SL-missionaries is being sold as software. Such software is used by brokers for things like changing the settings for your individual account if your EA or yourself are too profitable and because the broker takes the other side of your trade, he loses money. It detects this automatically and allows the broker to change the settings of your account ( slippage manipulation for example which includes spikes to take out your SL ). So, better ask your broker if he uses software similar to the virtual dealer plugin and of course he will not lie about it because all brokers are honest. The SL-missionaries here guarantee that, they know that all brokers are honest and that the virtual dealer plugin or similar software is only a "conspiracy theory". Nacho, why do you allow those guys to ruin your thread ? Why don´t you ban them ?

Nice to see you on here Courtney Its an interesting thread, however as you say, its attracted some interesting views from the no stoploss and must use stoploss brigade. One of the no stop loss chaps has offered to set up a demo to explore the possibility of not using a stoploss, it would be interesting to see one of the vocal 'you must use a stoploss' guru's also doing the same, however Im doubting that they will come forward. Brian, and chips laterly started a fire on the pitbull thread, but for reasons that you and i know about the posse tried to put the fire out but ended up pissing down their balls, hopefully the same will happen here.

That being said, you can use all the SLs in the world, if you are not consistently profitable, you will lose your money. Same applies for the no SL approach.

If a group of traders want to explore the possibility of not using a stoploss then let them get on with it, traders know what the potential dangers are..... and benefits, and what the f"ck has it got to do with anyone else, if someone doesn't want to use a stop then let them. The forum has listened to the SL views but somehow I dont think they are listening to the non SL views. The must have brigade have expressed their views, its been noted, now let the thread evolve in the direction that the OP originally wanted. If you must use a stop loss then start a new thread titled 'You must use a stoploss because the broker needs yer wonga',.

That in not an accurate fact based statement and has been made up by lillelise. I agree with attila: what works for you works for you. Good luck Nacho but I have done my stint with the numbsculls and choose not to participate any of my energy here as they are vampires and will suck you dry with futility. My account is only up 62.94% this last 30 days and I have to go manage it up a little higher. Good luck to all.

with all due respect, and trust that courneywild's performance of last 30 days, i can't kill my doubt that how long he can keep doing this. let's say 50% a month, one year later, it'll be 12900%. Yes, 129 times of now. never heard this thing on earth before. in 5 yrs, he will turn $1 into 36 billion $$$. i do wish he can get it done, because in that case, i will gain my hope too. however, it shakes my belief in this world. just a reminder to noobs.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
to do anything in this world, living, working, and trading, one will have a day that she has to give up something, which is in fact a stoploss. no matter she likes to taste or not.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
you can say that for yourself for sure i understand that you trade that way since you trade for a living but you cannot say "no full time trader......" since there are some traders who trade for growth (not only for a living). why should one NOT increase his lots?

You think you are so smart don't you? Who hasn't heard of the Virtual Dealer Plugin (VDP) by now. You are not some prophet telling us something we don't already know, but apparently you are misinformed on what the dealer plugin does. Before I explain it however, I would first like to say that this particular software only applies to MetaTrader platforms. Anyway, VDP does not hunt your stop. It delays the execution of your order which usually results in slippage to the broker's favor. So what does that have to do with stop hunting? That they are bad guys who would try and cheat? Of course they do, tell us something no one knows. Does that mean that trading without a stop loss is better? I don't think so. I think you give these 'not-so-good guys' a free run at your money if you don't put up barriers (stop losses). Again, unrealized and realized are the same. If you don't think so, then try withdrawing the unrealized loss from your account. Now I'd like to take this opportunity to make something clear, since some people are acting like this is a war between SL or no SL... I never said you can't make money trading without a SL. In fact, I encourage it if you are clueless as to how to trade. To me, and experienced traders will agree with me here, trading with a stop is the way to go because you can compound your gains. Not only compund them, but at an exponential rate. You can't do that with a no stop loss method. Now if you don't have the skill or discipline to trade, then yes go with a no stop loss strategy risking dollars for pennies. I will continue to risk pennies for dollars. Good luck!

Hi Chavro You sucked me back in to this thread. Your right to doubt, I doubt most things said in FX until I test it myself! Now slow down a bit please... wwwooo up there; I have never said anything remotely like your hypothesis in your post. I have never said I could sustain that performance for any particular length of time... but I'll take it while I can :-) I never said I could compound to a hypothetical 53 billion dollars... never said it, don't believe it, not interested in even trying for it. I guess my point is whats the point of the hypothesis, you can't spend it so why do it.... just focus on what you can do, with something right here right now, and avoid wasting time working out if you can make this into a 53 billion mega jackpot in 5 years time.... Not interested, my focus is totally on the now, today. What profit can I bank today. I don't trade the method posted by nacho on this thread. I trade my own, which is a variant of pitbull which has been a complete revelation to me and proving very consistent, however I'm not here to hijack the thread back to those days. I do support free thinking and always look at these threads with interest to see if I can add to the thread or take from them. Also a point on SL nor no SL, I do take losses on a trade (not via SL) and do not let a trade run to 1000s of pips negative, but I do have a way of taking those losses out whilst ensuring most of the time my balance (equity) grows... it is in fact almost the Holy Grail.... ROFL. I'm a realist and fully understand "things change in the market," well all apart from one constant... and that one constant is nothing is guaranteed. Have fun and good trading. PS Hi to Moody.

Why don't we just ban everybody with something reasonable to say that is contrary to what you believe? Wouldn't that make it easier for you? Listen, if your trader friend lost all of your money, I can assure you he was in over his head. He lost not because he used a stop loss. He lost because he doesn't know how to trade. Like I said before, you can just as easily lose your money without a stop loss as you can with a stop because what's to stop the br0ker from running price against you all the way to margin call? Unrealized = realized. The sooner you acknowledge this, the sooner you are closer to being a trader. Otherwise you are an "investor" holding tiny positions for long periods of time.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
everybody has a SL..... some uses 5 -10-20 % and so on.. some uses all 100%

--- 帖子 #335 ---
this is interesting why u asked so many questions? or u just assumed that u know the answers of all of them? if one has 200k, why do you think it is reasonable for him to trade 1 lot only (supposing he has a profitable system)? these simple facts and truth are existing no matter how big i trade or how profitable i am if u like to elaborate, go ahead with logical proof. don't say that in FF most ppl trade 0.01 lot...... so what? most ppl in FF are losing too....... the street guys who manage billions, u think they don't need to mind % but only trade a few LOTS to earn their living everyday?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I hope you aren't bunching me into this crowd. Like I've always said, you can make money with no stop loss. My contention is that compared to trading with a stop loss, no stop loss is much less profitable. First you have to know how to trade though. That involves experience and discipline. No one is trying to stop anyone from trading a certain way. I'm not at least. I'm only explaining why I trade with a stop and why it is more profitable than trading without a stop loss. In terms of compounding gains exponentially, it's simple math. You should be able to comprehend it in your mind without putting it down on paper. I'm also trying to explain how the "no-stop-is-safer" mentality is a fallacy since unrealized loss = realized loss. But again, if you can't trade profitably, then I recommend no stop loss. Just please don't come here and say you're a trader. You're an investor.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Even though that's true, that's not what this discussion is about. It's about whether to take small losses or take THE BIG ONE. Stating that everyone has a final stop (margin call) is not only obvious, but irrelevant to the debate.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
actually an irrelevant discussion then......what counts is the results.. even i would claim..if you risk all...one day you gonna lose it..( refering to the law of the big numbers ) to discuss SL ..one need to know the system... even moneymannegement count...where did the 2% rule come from ??? matematekly you can calculate excatly your lots sizes and risk...if you have enoughf trades to use for it..

sorry if my misunderstanding sounds offensive to you...... not meant that at all just during these days i myself have been painfully meditating the fundamental truth of trading: SL/no SL, risk, randomness, edges...... those things...... therefore my questions are frank and too frank sometimes...... good luck to your trading. i know that u pitbulls guys been doing well for a while. in fact, i have tons of doubt in "pitbull method", but i am very interested to see how it plays out for you guys, and i hope to see you guys walk long and well on that road.

[quote=2+2=4ex;5558072] Read the comments of some SL-missionaries and you will know that they never heard of it or maybe they are liars. You have a strange attitude. You don´t read but jump in somewhere and you don´t know what you are talking about. As I said. You don´t know to whom you talk because you haven´t read what I wrote. Do your homework before you get more confused. This proves that you don´t understand lock-unlock nor trading hedges nor what the debate between LazyPawn and me was all about. A realized loss is not the same as unrealized loss. You can find the explanation in this thread or elsewhere. The big SL-missionary is revealing his big truths here. Then tell me why you posted the Grid method on your website. Just clicked on your link in your signature, dude and what did I find there ? Read: Or isn´t it your website, dude ? If it is, what are you trying to tell people here and why are you attacking my grid system which is proftable and sound ? Are you confused or what is urging you to attack me here ? Did you smoke something ? Where do I use a no stop loss strategy ? Do your homework, dude, before you attack experienced traders and offend them like LazyPawn did. You know that he not only lost his manners, he lost the argument too. You are on your way to the same goal, dude, if you continue to offend me. Maybe I will make a signature because some just do not read before they post: I make profits using hedges and I make profits using traditional SL. Sometimes I use this, sometimes that. Both are profitable for those who know what they do. Unlock your mind and allow others to trade the way they like instead of offending them.

going by the last couple of pages atleast 1 person understands the only way you can sustain gains without stops is to inbalance the simple maths. and its not possible without knowing what you need to do.glad sombody does,

The best way to get around the broker games is to use low leverage. Then they cant hurt you. They can play all the games they want but there is nothing they can do if you use low leverage and lot sizes. It takes the broker game completely out of the picture. Let me give you my big trader example and why they trade 1:1 If a trader puts up 1 million into a trade that would be 10 100K lots. He pays no swap fees and the broker has no funds of his own in. Lets say he makes the worst trade of his life and sells when the euro was at 82 cents in 2000 and kept that trade all the way until the euro hits its high of 1.60 in 2008. That is just over 7000 pips. He would be down 10 x 7000 or 70,000 dollars. That is 7% of his account taking the worst trade possible. People who trade low leverage simply by the math have little or no danger to their accounts. If he knew how to CT trade with some skill the other 2 million he has to trade with he actually could make more money than that floating loss would do. To us that understand that principle, not that we like making such a stupid trade or do trades like that, we know that trading in such a way takes out the effects of any broker games or bad misjudgments on our part. It is why we constantly win and any DD does not never has the effect these guys so desperately try to argue we have over and over again. I have said this time and again. They really dont understand or get it. So there is nothing I can do about that but continue to put money in the bank. LOL

--- 帖子 #344 ---
10 lots is 100/pip so 7000X100=700,000.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Lots are lots they are not pips. When price moves they move by pips. So if 10 lots move one pip that is 10 dollars. If they move 7000 pips it is 70,000 dollars. 70K is 7% of 1,000,000. I am using 1 lot equals 1 dollar as an example. I know some brokers .10 equals 1 dollar if that causes any confusion. I shouldnt have said 1 lot equals 100,000. Sorry for the confusion got the math wrong but the concept doesnt change. Anyway let the crucifixion begin, nanningbob made a mistake so everyone have at it. I will resurrect in a couple of days.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
It seems to me that those that use NO SL are those that fear their broker. The big evil broker with their dealer plug-in. The broker who spikes the market and takes out your position TO ONLY return back in your direction. LOL I'm very happy with my MT4 broker(s). I'm very happy with all my brokers. Why because thats how I make my living..They pay me every month. They are not the enemy. Maybe once you lose that ridiculous mindset you might advance as a trader???? Brokers are not your enemy Bob... WTH are "The Broker Games" ??? And fxtr51...... Pipmutt is bang on.... Go try and withdrawl your floating losses... Only a fool would think a floating loss is a better situation. Professional traders do not trade the way this thread is suggesting or the way fxtr is or Nanning bob or Alorente. And Bob who in their right mind would trade a million dollars the way you suggest. What an utter waste of capital. Broker games...click...click...click...click...click.....

Guys forgive me my boldness but what means PA ? Nacho mentions that indicator and I cannot figure out what mean the abbreviation? Hermes

--- 帖子 #348 ---
That's simply a matter of standard/mini/micro accounts. One needs to know which account type they have. In other matters, you speak/write with great wisdom. However, I find that I'm unable to trade with such restrictions. I fear that I may die before I reach my goals. I realize that the tortoise is renowned for longevity and the hare falls victim to many predators. Still, the hare survives. This post isn't intended to argue with NB. We all have our personality and preference. Can you survive best as a tortoise or a hare? idk !

PA = Price Action. I don't know of an indicator called PA.

BUT WAIT !!! After further research I've discovered that pipmutt is "bang on" while bluesteele may be the "lunatic that took over the asylum". What a drama. what does this mean

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Bob's mistake on lot sizing is excusable. Not something to bash someone for. I think you hit the nail right on the head Slim when you said you want to be able to achieve your goal within your lifetime. Afterall, what's the point in trading if it's going to take 200 years to reach your goal? Bob keeps alluding to the safety of trading with no leverage and small position sizes citing "that's the way the pros do it". What he fails to acknowledge is that even though your risk of ruin is practically zero, so is your chances of doubling your account. What he keeps implying, but has yet to say for whatever reason, is that he stacks positions when he is positive. This is also known as pyramiding, inverted pyramiding or column stacking. I'm guessing this is what he is trying to say when he suggests that a particular move of X amount of pips gains more than a move of equal distance for a loss. What he fails to understand is that trading still comes down to skill and knowing where to add/stack another position. The skill is knowing when to take advantage of an edge. My contention is if one knows where to stack a position, then why not just trade the setup straight up as a single trade of larger size? By doing it this way, you can bank more pips all the way up (or down) to the final destination you previously sought. With that said, the big boys do trade with little or no leverage. However, they also are trading with plenty of money (millions) and capital preservation takes on a whole new meaning at that level. For one thing, they don't get filled like a retail trader that has an account with a market maker does. Take their method and apply to a $100,000 account (or less) and it doesn't make sense to ME to trade that way. For someone like myself, the time involved for such a small return is not worth it. Again, I want to be able to live long enough to reach MY goals. Like I always say, you might as well buy bonds or cd's if you're going to take this approach to investing. Notice I said investing and not trading.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
You made some great points. I think NB is a good trader and his wisdom/longevity speaks for itself. I can learn something from his trading but try to adapt it (if desired) to my own style. We'll never stop learning (if we're lucky) and we each adopt our own style. great trading !

Never heard of what? And who are these stop loss missionaries you speak of? I think that our definition of 'strange' differs. I'm sorry but I don't understand what you are saying here. All I've done is state (repeatedly) why I prefer trading with a stop loss. What am I confused about? Please clarify. The way you describe lock and unlock makes it hard to understand. Lock and unlock is another way of saying hedged or non-hedged, correct? So if you have 4 lots long and 3 lots short, then your are net 1 lot long, correct? You're basically just playing a mind trick on yourself by locking and unlocking when you can achieve the same result by having one open position. Now I'm not telling you to trade a different way if you feel comfortable that way. If it helps you manage the trade, then by all means continue with what makes you feel comfortable. Just don't tell me I'm wrong or that I don't understand something when I clearly understand it. I suggest you read Hanover's comments earlier that a trader can only be net long, net short or flat at a given moment. He does a fine job of explaining it. Oh, so I'm a stop loss missionary! You make the incorrect assumption that since I have a website with a strategy on it, it must be the strategy that I trade. I personally don't trade that Grid strategy on my website because I prefer to be more aggressive. I have outlined the reasons (such as exponential compounding) why I prefer to trade with a stop loss. With that said, someone could trade that strategy and ultimately be profitable. If I didn't believe that then it wouldn't be on my site. My site is intended to help others, mainly (but not limited to) beginners, to become better traders. That particular strategy I admit is rather amateur. It is intended more for the consistently losing trader to become a non-losing trader or slightly profitable trader, but that particular strategy just isn't my cup of tea. I have always maintained that a no stop loss method, such as a grid, can ultimately be profitable if done properly. And I say properly with a great deal of caution. Now just because it can be profitable, doesn't mean that it will outperform a stop loss method executed properly. Due to the nature of trading small position sizes in a no-stop loss method and length of time involved, it is virtually impossible to replicate the results. Whoa whoa whoa, I never attacked you. On the contrary, I have been polite and respectful. The only thing we disagree on is our selection of methods that we use. I have thoroughly explained why I trade the way I do (with a stop loss). I never once suggested your system is not sound nor profitable. The truth is that a stop loss method executed properly makes more money as compared to a no-stop loss method executed properly. Simple as that. That is not an attack, that is a fact. So, who's the one attacking? Whatever. Dude.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Great post. I totally believe this.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
It is the spirit in which it is stated. I simply realize there are many ways to trade. You dont see me attacking using SL, I choose to use an alternative method. Still takes trading skill that takes time to master. It is those that come in a bash others all the time and provide no real knowledge of trading. You notice BLueSteele, I have never seen him post one single positive idea that would help make a better trader. He is just a head hunting head basher. People have challenged him to show some good trading points and he runs and hides every single time. Go ahead click on his name and check out his posts throughout FF. He is a waste of time and space. My rate of return is around 7-10% a month . I try to double my account every 7-9 months. Are there guys who do better. Of course, but not that many. If 10% a month is being a tortoise I wear the badge proudly, truth is there are very very few investments that ever do that. China is considered a miracle at 8-9% a year, so I am suppose to be ashamed of 7-10% a month. If a bank offered 10% a year people would be breaking down their doors to put their money there. The very fact that so and so earlier keeps saying I know no trader who trades that way has simply not been around people outside his own little tiny crowd. That is all that means.

And until you learn how to, you will never ever have any compound growth to your unleveraged acct. Just a shelf full of peanuts. Might as well go flip burgers... again.... Traders here will become better traders by staying away from Nonsense methods like yours and those that use No SL and No leverage. Whatcha looking at my posts for anyways..

He will come back when he thinks the coast is clear. Same thing with Nubs if he ever show up. He cant teach anything constructive either.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I wasn't offended, truly. Just clarifying some things so its not read that I propose any method of trading is that "out there." I'm pretty conservative in my approach to all things trading related. There's enough BS out there. :-) The issue with "posts" is they are a bit like email and are easily misinterpreted. I am conservative in my approach and choose not to use a SL. I prefer MM/risk control using lot size and agree with Nanningbob on this. Even though I don't use a SL I do sometime give money to my broker... but the timing of that suits me not them. Have a great day trading, I'm back out of here as I have nothing to add that hasn't been said on PB. Ok back to the Grail. lol

Did you read at least a few postings in this thread ? If yes, how come you pretend you cannot identify the stop loss missionaries ? Really ? Why not ? It is very easy to understand. Why do you have problems with that ? Look: where the losser has his StopLoss, I have a pending order with same lot-size. Is this too complicated for you to understand ? Why ? I am not 4 lots long and 3 lots short. Where did you read that ? Above you said you don´t understand my lock-unlock. Now you suddenly understand clearly ? How come ? I am asking myself why you have come here. The question is why you are here. Look: The thread starter told everybody that he trades without a SL. This thread is not about SL versus No SL. But the SL-missionaries didn´t respect him. They hijacked this thread and still do with pictures of dogs and other nonsense and they still make noise and offend everyone who trades profitable with no SL or with my lock-unlock method. Ok, you are not able to identify the SL-missionaries and hijackers, so there is a real problem you have. Nacho was told that he should use a stop loss somewhere or use my method. We could have discussed it a bit more and in the meanwhile other traders contributed to the topic. But the SL missionaries still fight because they want to "convince" everybody that the SL must not be 500 Pips away but the usual 10 or 20 or 50 Pips depending on the timeframe. And if a trader is placing the SL according to their teachings and lose, he is an idiot of course. They are beating a dead horse and they don´t contribute to this thread but destroy the discussion and they don´t forget to offend the creative and traders almost in each comment they make. And what is your place in this mission ? You are doing nothing else than trying to convince everybody that trading with a SL is better than without a SL. But hey, listen: that is not the point in this thread. You must have missed the point completely. That´s why I suggested that you should read first. Why can´t you just respect Nacho ? The aggressive hijackers don´t, but you pretend to be more clever and more polite , or not ? Wow. You must have missed that, right ? It is post #282 here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...87#post5554187 We established that the hijackers don´t care. But you are more educated and not on that low level they are. Or not ? So why are you here spamming this thread with postings which don´t contribute to the topic ?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Actually I was interested in how he was going to use the 5MA on a 4H chart. I love trading the 4H with an eye on the daily so this does interest me. So maybe we should posts some charts and get that going. Nacho what were you really wanting to show?

I love how you conveniently take my comments and quote them out of context. Maybe I should start doing that to you. Anyway, it is apparent you are only here to be combative and pick a fight. I have better things to do, so good luck with that locking/unlocking fiasco you came up with. Maybe some day you will learn how to unlock logic out of that thing in your head called a brain.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Wrong. I only combat those who offend me and those who hijacked the thread. That is necessary since Nacho doesn´t take ban them. He could avoid the constant bickering of the hijackers and I don´t understand why he isn´t doing it.(maybe because he doesn´t know how) The only fiasco is that you don´t understand it .... and I have better things to do too. Your departure will save me a lot of time, dude. You got it wrong. Logic must not be unlocked because then it would be gone. You are using the word "unlock" out of context because you haven´t understood lock-unlock yet. I told you before you would end like LazyPawn but you decided to not listen. Not my fault, dude.

So if you're long 1 lot, where the "losser" would put a pending order to sell 1 lot, you instead put a pending order to sell 1 lot. I think everybody else is quite clear on what you are doing there. Of course, that is entirely off-topic to the thread which is supposed to be about trading without leverage and not limiting losses.

Sorry, euclid, you are wrong. You missed the topic too. Look here: This leaves a lot of room for interpretations. My understanding is: NO leverage to Nacho means he will use only 0.01 lots. But his account might allow for 1:500 leverage. We don´t know it. Does he use a micro-cent account ? Or not ? If he would use a micro-cent account, his balance would 1000 x 100 = 100.000 instead of 1000, he would have told us "my balance is 100.000 and I use only 0.01 lots". In this context, NO leverage means using the lowest lot-size. -----&gt; I am not off-topic at all with my lock-unlock Now look here: I don´t use SL in my lock-unlock method. ----&gt; I am not off-topic at all. Now let us remember what you said about me: Do you understand that you are entirely wrong ? So, what is the purpose of your comment ?

Just appealing to you to stop disrupting this thread, which was about no leverage trading. I know you and the brokers don't like that idea. You want people to use leverage and hedging. But IMO it's not appropriate for you to promote that agenda here.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
HEDGING? Come on... Let's not start this again. "Hedging" is a waste of money. Don't do it. It doesn't help you. You are buying and selling the same thing.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Sorry, euclid. You are completely wrong. If you have enough money, then trade without leverage. Nowhere did I say one single word against that. And I don´t want people to hedge. I just showed Nacho a way to trade more safely than without stop-loss. Nowhere did I say that he has to trade like that or that it is the only way to trade. No agenda at all. So, what is your point ? Those you made are not valid. They are completely besides the topic.

Dumb. Thank you for proving how incapable of a trader you really are. You and BS ought to form the incompetent club, you are totally unable to explain something you are clearly not successful at.

Hedging has been used for ages as a trading tool. Whether you do a buy or sell on the gbp/usd or a buy on the gbp/usd and a sell on the gbp/jpy or a sell on an option to protect your trade they are the same thing. It is whether or not you know how to use it to your advantage. Hedging is the practice of taking a position in one market to offset and balance against the risk adopted by assuming a position in a contrary or opposing market or investment.

How a typical hedge works: A stock trader believes that the stock price of Company A will rise over the next month, due to the company's new and efficient method of producing widgets. He wants to buy Company A shares to profit from their expected price increase. But Company A is part of the highly volatile widget industry. If the trader simply bought the shares based on his belief that the Company A shares were underpriced, the trade would be a speculation. Since the trader is interested in the company, rather than the industry, he wants to hedge out the industry risk by short selling an equal value (number of shares × price) of the shares of Company A's direct competitor, Company B. The first day the trader's portfolio is: Long 1,000 shares of Company A at $1 each Short 500 shares of Company B at $2 each Now FOREX is unique because you pair two separate currencies together. In other words you dont have to go out and find the opposite position it is paired with the currency. So if you buy the eur you can protect your position from risk (hedging) by also selling the USD. The difference is in stocks you have to get another stock to make the hedge. In Forex they are already paired together. So if you use the example above Company A makes a profit while company B goes down. If it works you later resell company B stock when it increase after you closed out Company A for a profit. Same thing if the opposite happens if company A stock goes down then B goes up. The danger of this strategy is if both go down you are a double loser. However, that cant happen in Forex. IN BOTH CASES it still takes a trading skill to properly buy and sell and then close both out so you end up with a profit. It is not NEDGING as certain characters try to make it.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
That's not the point. Anyway, hedging = dumb. Let me explain why... Scenario #1: 10 lots short hedged with 5 lots long = 5 lots short Scenario #2: 5 lots short without hedge = 5 lots short Therefore, net position of scenario #1 = net position of scenario #2 Follow me so far? Good. Moving along... Scenario #1 pays out interest on 10 lots and gains interest (at a lower rate than interest is paid out) on 5 lots. Scenario #2 pays out interest on 5 lots only. Therefore, with hedging you pay more interest than you would without hedging on the same net position. Even if you invert the interest gained to the greater position size you will recieve less interest with hedging as compared to without hedging. Because interest rate payout to br0ker is higher than interest payout to trader . This is very basic math. Conclusion: Hedging = dumb.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Bob... this explanation of yours makes horrible sense. I'm not sure if you are doing this on purpose or what... In stocks, people hedge using things like options. There is a benefit to hedge in that situation. There are things called interest or premium which can be paid to the trader (in this case you). That way, you not only minimize exposure, you can also profit on interest. That is a reason why people hedge in stocks, options or futures. By hedging, they will ultimately end up making less than being purely directional. You reduce risk but give up more on profits. However, the important distinction here is that your hedge positions may end up making profits for you, although they may be mediocre. There is no benefit of the "hedge" in forex. Not by using 1 instrument (spot forex only.) If you went long eurusd, and "hedge" buy usdjpy, you are in effect trading long eurjpy. The worst thing about this "hedge" is that you end up paying premium to your broker for opening 2 position by paying swap and spread. There is no benefit to this so called hedge of yours. Not by using only spot forex as an instrument.

Bob, I wasn’t going to post again, but I saw another way of presenting the diagram back in my post #122. I’ve attached the extended image below. Hopefully it will also help others to see where LazyPawn, 2+2=4ex, pipmutt etc are coming from. To get the background, you’ll need to work through post #122 , step by step. But if you take the time to do this, you’ll see why Merlin coined the term "nedging" ( n ewbie h edging ). I refer to the additional diagrams out to the right. Blue areas represent where a trade is making pips, and red areas where a trade is losing pips. In Scenario A, the hedged trader (Mr L) makes two trades, L1 and L2, worth +120 and +30 for a total of +150 pips. The conventional trader, Mr M, also makes trades, M1 and M3, worth +80 and +70, also for a total of +150. Here is the basis for comparison: While Mr L is hedged, his trade L1 is losing 30 pips while is trade L2 is gaining 30 pips, for a net effect of zero. Hence the shaded red area and the shaded blue arrow effectively cancel each other out. If we remove these two objects from the diagram (because they cancel each other, just like equal numerators and denominators in an algebraic equation), we get exactly the same result as for Mr M. That’s why both traders made a total of +150. Exactly the same logic applies to Scenario B. Where Mr L’s trades are hedged, they are shaded, and the corresponding areas can be cancelled, again leaving exactly the same net positions as Mr M, at every point along the way. In this scenario, however, both traders’ timing was less perfect, so they each made only +130 this time (as explained in post #122). Merlin’s point is that ANY scenario that employs hedging will include overlapping blue and red arrows whenever the trader is hedged, and that these arrows can be cancelled, leaving a net flat position. The remaining arrows (when the trader unhedges himself) are when the trader is net long or net short, which is exactly the same as being long or short using conventional trading. Nobody is saying that you can’t make money hedging. Mr L made profits of +150 and +130 in the diagrammed scenarios. But the point that’s being made is that he didn’t outperform Mr M, and therefore hedging doesn’t offer any benefit over conventional methods. It is merely a different approach to placing orders, nothing more. That's why Merlin calls it "nedging". Merlin offered $100,000 to anybody who could create a scenario where a hedged set of trades couldn’t be replicated by simply being net long, short or flat. As far as I’m aware, nobody was able to win the money. There is one small drawback to hedging. In my example, both traders placed 2 trades, hence (everything else being equal) both would have paid the same spread. However, there are situations (e.g. here ) where the hedged trader pays more spread than the conventional trader. Also, assuming your br0ker charges more swap on counter-carry trades than he pays out on carry trades, the hedged trader will pay the difference every time his hedge happens to be open at 5pm New York EST, while the conventional trader, being out of the market, pays no swap. I agree 100% with you that " IN BOTH CASES it still takes a trading skill to properly buy and sell and then close both out so you end up with a profit. " The winning edge comes from the timing, not from the method used to place the orders. Profit is a case of being net long while prices are rising, and net short while they're falling. David Note to everybody : I don’t mind answering sensible questions, but I will not be drawn into any needless “I know more than you do” arguments. If you can find a flaw in the math involved, expose it for what it is. And don’t forget to also PM your own diagrammed scenario to Merlin, and collect your $100k.

Thanks for your explanation. Since I cant hedge in the USA anymore I dont. When I could I used it as a time out. Something happened I didnt expect and wanted time to plan out a strategy, so for me it was like calling a time out OR I liked my position (back when I traded lower TF) and I had to go out or leave the computer. I could freeze the trade at its present profit stage and come back later and see if I wanted to continue. As a strategy I dont use it. The one currency pair I could do sell and buys at the same time and it worked consistantly was the AUD/NZD. It would bounce up and down in a 50-100 pip range all day and night. That changed when China started buying up AUD products and changed the fundamental relationship between those two. You could do a buy and sell both ways set the TP at 25 or 30 and it would hit both of them every day, in fact several times a day. But that wont work anymore. So there is a place for it but I am not a hedger, but I dont discount its occasional use. I see a use for it for special occasions that's all. For that thought let the anti-hedge crucification begin. Watch these guys condemn me as a hedger now.

Another good point. Multiple pair hedging can also be reduced down to its lowest terms, which normally represents a single position in one pair. In your example, EUR/USD x USD/JPY = EUR/JPY. It's a case of cancelling like numerators and denominators. To anybody who doubts this, multiply the current EU price by the current UJ price, and then compare the result to the current EJ price. If you're short in any pair, simply invert the currency, and then proceed to cancel like numerators and denominators, as before. I've seen threads where folk claim that they can make money from triangular, quadranglar, etc hedges, but the fact is that they could achieve the same thing by trading 1 (or possibly 2) pairs, and pay less spread and swap in the process. Consider a circular hedge, e.g.: EUR/USD x USD/JPY x JPY/GBP x GBP/EUR The algebra cancels to 1/1, so we might assume that if we were long 1 lot EU, long 1 lot UJ, short 1 lot GJ, and short 1 lot EG, that our P/L would remain zero, regardless of price movement. Not quite true. This is because (assuming our account is denominated in USD), each pip moved in EU results in a +/- $10 P/L, but not so for the other pairs. However, it would be possible to balance the equation by adjusting the position sizes of the other pairs (continuously, if necessary) to create a net zero position. (Of course there would be no point in doing so, unless we wanted to offer charity by way of spread and swap to our br0ker, LOL. I was merely using this as an example to illustrate the math concepts involved).

I know this is often pointed out in forex that if you trade usd/jpy and eur/usd you are really trading eur/jpy. There is a fallacy in the argument because FOREX is about trading funds between companies and nations. traders are only a very small part of the 3 trillion in action. There is little to no relationship between trading between US govt and companies with JPY companies USD/JPY and trading EUR/USD govt and companies. What goes back and forth between the Atlantic Ocean and what goes on between the Pacific Ocean does not correlate with the trade between Europe and Japan. There is a fallacy there with the logic. A buy on the USD/JPY and a sell on the EUR/USD has nothing to do with trading the EUR/JPY. Each currency exchange is independent of each other. I proved this in my aud/nzd thread when it used to have high pip spreads . People would just say trade aud/usd and nzd/usd, you will get the same thing. No you didnt because the price action was not related at all. AUD companies and NZD companies trading with each other has nothing to do with AUD and NZD companies trading with the USA. They are independent actions, therefore the price action will be different. A company in Europe exchanging a JPY business check has no effect on the EUR/USD or the USD/JPY. They are independent actions from each other.

That is straight out of Wikipedia. HMMMMMMMMM wonder where they got it or .........???????????????

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Bob, I agree that the transactions are completely independent, but prices are somehow manipulated by banks so that AUD/NZD is always equal to AUD/USD x USD/NZD. There may be fleeting moments where this is not the case, at which point arbitrage opportunities are potentially available, if/when the amount of the inefficiency exceeds the transaction costs (spread etc). If this triangular equilibrium were to break down for long enough, then there would be a huge opportunity for everybody to profit at the ultimate expense of the banks; of course, the latter do their utmost to ensure that this is not allowed to happen. Please see my post here . The plots on the posted chart were created by my Recent Prices indy. I created the indy specifically because, at that time, I was looking for arbitrage opportunities myself. Note how, in the example, the white line (EURGBP) always represents the difference between the red (GU) and pink (EU) lines. I experimented with enough similar charts to satisfy myself that equilibrium is maintained to the point that seeking arbitrage opportunities is a futile exercise. David

WOW.... I see so much confusion about synthetic pairs and crosses... *sadface* Here: http://www.babypips.com/school/creat...tic-pairs.html Anyone thinking a cross doesn't have anything to do with trading against the USD is forgetting that a synthetic that creates a cross pair has eliminated the exposure to the common currency. You just have to think in terms of exposure. If one trade gets long USD, and another short for the same value, then your net USD exposure is nil and you are exposed to the remaining long/short currencies, which creates a synthetic cross. Put another way, all you've done is used a common currency as a pricing tool and eliminated it from affecting your position. Specifically, it's called triangular arbitrage (you mentioned arbitrage later in your post.) It's not really manipulated, it's just an efficient market.

This is how I would understand it. Let us take the car industry. When the economy is going good car sales are up and when bad sales are down. I am a buyer and I go buy a car from Ford. As far as the industry goes I helped the entire industry with the car sale but on a specific level I only helped Ford. GM, Toyota, and Chrysler it had no effect. So ............. It shows up on an industry wide level and Ford but the rest of the companies no effect. I think the same thing with currencies. It helps the overall currency level each transaction but on each separate level only where the sale occurred. So there is correlation overall on a broad basis but it only helps the specific currency pair the deal is done in. That is how I understand it.

There is no fallacy. Any differences are immediately arbitraged away by algos. If there was any significant difference for any significant period of time (milliseconds), this would produce a huge arbitrage opportunity. It would mean free money for us. Not gonna happen.

Dont like Wikipedia's definition, it is the world's #1 encyclopedia. Encyclopedia Britanica stopped making encyclopedias to sell because of them. How about investipedia's definition then since you dont have one; Hedging is the practice of purchasing and holding securities specifically to reduce portfolio risk. These securities are intended to move in a different direction than the remainder of the portfolio - for example, appreciating when other investments decline. Definition of 'Forex Hedge' A transaction implemented by a forex trader to protect an existing or anticipated position from an unwanted move in exchange rates. By using a forex hedge properly, a trader who is long a foreign currency pair can be protected from downside risk, while the trader who is short a foreign currency pair can protect against upside risk. NOTICE THEY DIDNT USE THE WORD STOP LOSS!!!! Dont like that one, here is the definition form Business Dictionary: A risk management strategy used in limiting or offsetting probability of loss from fluctuations in the prices of commodities, currencies, or securities. In effect, hedging is a transfer of risk without buying insurance policies. Hedging employs various techniques but, basically, involves taking equal and opposite positions in two different markets (such as cash and futures markets). Finally a definition used by FOREX brokers (SNB recognizes over 700 of them around the world): There are a number of forex dealers, dare I say even the majority, who allow clients to practice what is commonly referred to as “hedging” in the forex. What this means is that they allow clients to open both long and short positions in the same currency pair, at the same time. Conclusion: that is the definition of hedging and that is how it is used. Whether it is viable or not is the traders choice but let us quit using stupid word games. IN FOREX hedging means to take opposite trades on the same currency pair. Again either state your position and quit this poor stupid Bob pooh pooh garbage. If you cant form your own position and defend it, quit posting and quit running running like BlueSteele does. Still waiting for your answer on how to use a SL.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
It is funny that a simple concept is not understood and that lack of understanding is on your part. E/U * U/J = E/J. Do yourself a favor and every fifteen minutes whip out your calculator and do the math. As others have pointed out forex is one of the most efficient markets. And that has to be the case or it opens up major arb opportunities as well as it's simple math and the way quotes work since they share a currency. In your example E/J cannot move without one if not both other pairs in the equation compensating for it. That's the way it works. An hour with a calculator will prove that to you. Think of it this way, each pair is a number. 6 * 4 = 24. Now the 6 increases to 8. Now 8 * 4 does not equal 24! So what has to happen is either the 4 has to change to a 3 or 24 has to change to 32. The same way when a single currency pair changes the pairs it's inextricably linked to have to change.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Please note I've changed the emphasis. Buying and selling the same currency pair in the same market at the same time is not hedging. It is called being out of the market. Only your NET position matters. Let's go with cars on this one: say you buy a car and then sell that car - at that point are you long car or short car? Neither. No matter how you do your accounting, you are OUT of the car market. Also, please understand how arbitrage works and you will see why EUR/JPY is very much dependent on USD/JPY and EUR/USD (and vice versa). I'm sorry Bob, but you are absolutely 100% wrong on both points.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
First of all, wikipedia is written by internet users. It is known for having many inaccuracies as a result. More than a reputable encyclopdia should at least. That doesn't mean it can't be useful, but it's not like it's the word of God. Now, hedging different instruments can be a viable strategy, but hedging same instruments is flat out dumb. It's dumb because of the additional cost of swap that is NOT neccessary when you can accomplish the same without hedging. Let me repost this for you in case you missed it... That's not the point. Anyway, hedging = dumb. Let me explain why... Scenario #1: 10 lots short hedged with 5 lots long = 5 lots short Scenario #2: 5 lots short without hedge = 5 lots short Therefore, net position of scenario #1 = net position of scenario #2 Follow me so far? Good. Moving along... Scenario #1 pays out interest on 10 lots and gains interest (at a lower rate than interest is paid out) on 5 lots. Scenario #2 pays out interest on 5 lots only. Therefore, with hedging you pay more interest than you would without hedging on the same net position. Even if you invert the interest gained to the greater position size you will recieve less interest with hedging as compared to without hedging. Because interest rate payout to br0ker is higher than interest payout to trader . This is very basic math. Conclusion: Hedging = dumb.

At this point Bob is just playing games. It's what he does when he's wrong. His ego doesn't allow him to admit there is a better way than his, let alone that he is wrong sometimes, so he starts acting like a fool. His way of dealing with the situation when he has been proven wrong is to try and provoke frustration to the other side. In other words he tries to play it off like he's just having fun. It's his little inside joke. What he doesn't realize is that everyone is already laughing (at him). Whatever you do, don't go in his 10.0 thread and prove him wrong. In there he's serious. In fact he has banned people for embarassing him in front of his little cult following.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Bob, With all due respect. You are not getting the concept of hedging correctly. At least based on the examples you are providing in this thread. Hedging over multiple instruments are generally the norm because of the fact that there could be premiums paid out to the trader while being in a hedged position. Hedging in stocks (as the only instrument) can also be viable (although I have not encountered any examples simply because using options as a hedging strategy is much more efficient and profitable) because stocks pay interest for holding them. So logically, you could be holding 2 hedged stocks forever and still end up profitable. Another example would be a oil palm farmer who generates tons of oil palm every year. He might decide to use the futures market and hedge himself so that his prices will always be fixed at a favourable rate. These are the uses of hedging. These are how it was intended to be used. Hedging in spot forex (as the only instrument) is not really hedging. 1)Firstly, you lose money on premiums (through swaps, spreads ) 2)You are basically cancelling out your positions if you "hedge" same pairs. 3)A synthetic pair, as jack larkin said, is not a hedge. You are right that at some point there will be inefficiencies such that there might be a bit of discrepancies between prices, but these are quickly closed up. If they are not, everybody would be rich. The concept for this is similar to how futures prices ultimately converges to its spot price as maturity approaches. There cannot be a difference or it will present an arbitrage opportunity for people and everybody will be millionaires. And wikipedia is not written by Paul Tudor Jones or Warran Buffet or George Soros. If they were, it would probably be a very different article.

Thank you for getting the discussion on track. This is the point. I dont care about whether you hedge or not. I didnt use it except for the couple of times I mentioned. It is not part of my trading arsenal. How hedging is termed and used outside of Forex is different how it is termed and used inside Forex. The Swiss National Bank said recently that it does business with over 700 forex brokers. If you call them and ask them do you allow hedging they all follow the same definition that is used in Forex. Buying and selling the same currency pair at the same time. Now whether you like that definition or not, that is how the term is used in Forex. Yes that is not how it is used elsewhere in other investment fields and I hope you dont think I am writing a big defense here in using it. I am not, how can I defend something I dont use. But in Forex that is its definition used industry wide whether you use it or not. So you can write all the posts you wont how, that really isnt hedging, but in Forex that is how it is defined and that is how it is used, whether you agree with the practice or not. In the USA they banned hedging (not nedging) so the definition as used in Forex stands. It is buying and selling the same currency pair. You cant change that with any argument. You can argue its value or not but not its definition because that is how it is used in the Forex field. Enough OK.

You are trying to make a business transaction a math problem. It isnt, its a business transaction. I proved this with the AUD/NZD. Put the tick charts up for the AUD/NZD, NZD/USD and AUD/USD. When a transaction happens the tick chart will move. If the aud/nzd transaction corresponded like you said then you would see corresponding action on the tick charts of the aud/usd and the nzd/usd. But you wont, in fact the tick chart you see most likely wont even be the same bank that transacted the business. The math formula you use is irrelevant. The transactions are independent of each other. The price action on the aud/nzd, aud/usd, and the nzd/usd are all different.

Since neither one of us is going to really call the SNB to ask that question, let's continue speculating . I bet you 1000 pips that if you asked anyone at the SNB if hedging was defined that way, they would laugh and hang up. Show me one place where they said they are banning hedging. What they are doing, is implementing a FIFO rule, which is logical, and therefore doesn't allow for accounting absurdities such as nedging. Oanda and several other reputable brokers (if there is such a thing) never allowed it in the first place - not because they are evil, but because they implement logical accounting standards. I don't think anyone claimed that they move in lockstep (I certainly didn't). What I said was that there is no significant difference for any significant period of time. What that means is that whenever a significant difference does present itself, it is arbitraged away by super fast computer algorithms that participate in the market, and by their very participation, alter prices in such a way as to close the very gaps that they are exploiting. It seems you didn't look up the word arbitrage. I still recommend it. Furthermore, synthetic pairs are generally not calculated using 1:1 lot ratios, and pricing precision is therefore affected further.

Sorry Bob I have nothing to teach you. Running??? Here I am...LOL Last time I checked this is an open forum. This isnt China Bob. I will say what I want when I want. If you have a problem with that, then you have a problem, it's not mine. And whats wrong with the various posters pointing out you are wrong? The general consensus is your wrong. No big deal.. It's OK to be wrong Bob..Sort of like stop losses and trades. You dont need to be right 90% of the time like you profess. really there is nothing wrong with a system that has a 60% win rate. Good Luck Bluesteele

Then you wont mind if I continue to treat each pairs price action separately then will you?? If you call a bank and say you want to trade Forex and they say yes, and then if you ask do you allow hedging they will say yes or no without any explanations. Whether you believe it is a valid trading method or not is not the point. It is how the word is used in Forex trading. I mean go to websites that list brokers, they will list them somewhere as allow or not allow hedging. They will list nano or not nano lots, they will list bonuses or no bonuses. I am amazed that such a simple term can be so distorted. In Forex I understand how the term is used. The only point I am making is that is how the term is used in Forex. That is all.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
The hedging term is NOT used in forex generally. It is used in RETAIL forex by brokers who bank on the fact that most inexperienced traders can be easily duped by an accounting trick. Unfortunately, it has now become so pervasive that it obscures the real meaning of the word. That is why Merlin tried to (half-jokingly) create the term nedging. I don't mind at all if you treat each pair's price action in any way you like. My purpose was not to tell you what I personally mind or don't mind when it comes to your trading - your trading has no tangible effect on me. I just wanted to show you the logical fallacies in your thinking.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I understand that somewhat, hedging is a specific trading skill which I definitely dont have. I just point out that the term is used differently in Forex than elsewhere. I actually dont have a problem with that, some people do but it is how the term is used.

Why are you so adamant about the definition of hedging if you don't even use it? Why bother?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
hedging is often used in forex,generally in futers,large companies generally employ these tactics to protect large risk with ther overseas transactions, the way hedging is being used here is nothing more than delaying the fact you have a large drawdown and want to scratch your head before it wipes a large part of your account out.mister me mentions hedging on options ect ,that is slightly diferent as you would have a futers option with a fixed risk but a large gain if in your directional favour.i can see how that could be of use for those protecting futer drawdown . as mentioned by thewls this is generally done in stocks.certainaly the ftse has a certain amount of correlated behavour with cable,somthing i have used for along time.but i think most people dont realise how all these currencies work. i follow 14 pairs and use the value changes to trade from.watch these changes and you will understand how this all works. if for example theres a 100 pip drop in euro for whatever reason,every other currencies value adjusts accordingly.

Please,please and please,can you guyz just leave this hedging arguments and focus on something constructive,beneficial and contributive to this guyz(Nacho) thread before you over-hedge,underhedge or nedge his thread? besides nacho'z thread has little or nothing to do with hedging,it lays emphasis on trading with no SL,no leverage and he said itz working 4 him so far.So i think it would be better if we help him sharpen his trading skills and strategy rather than filling up his thread with fruitless arguments coz as i see it,none of you will succumb to the opponent's opinion,so instead of that,i will suggest that one of you should open a thread with the topic-hedging,is it an effective strategy? and post whatever you like there,you know.

The outcome of business transactions is governed by math. If you go to the store and buy $8 worth of stuff and hand the cashier $10 you're gonna get $2 back. The two are not mutually exclusive. You seem to think that it's a coincidence or twist of fate that currency pairs are related in this manner and obviously didn't take the time to whip out your calculator and do some simple math. What you saw on your tick charts is irrelevant. As someone else pointed out it's not exact because it's a very fast moving market but will almost always be within transaction costs to avoid arb opportunities. There are also slight discrepancies due to banks using different feeds and different bid/ask. As well as the prices you see from your market maker are smoothed and rounded which is why you don't see an exact corresponding move on your tick chart. Don't fool yourself and think that the quotes you see only go as deep as what you see on your quote panel. Many shops are now showing down to the tenth of a pip but it goes deeper than that. Have you ever wondered why when you see a big move in the yen pairs that it happens on all yen pairs? Do you think it's a coincidence that someone somewhere sold dollars, pounds, frances, euros, etc, for yen all at the exact same time?! Thus creating moves at the exact same time. And that they were sold in amounts that exactly created rates that when you multiply, or divide, it's components that it always equals another rate? This relationship exists and frankly is a fact whether you believe it or not. As someone else suggested look up triangular arbitrage.

hi nanningbob, I always enter a trade when I spot an H4 candle closing above/below 5EMA, but since this does not happen very frequently, and I need to open a lot of positions to make some profit, I now also enter using TMS indicator which I find pretty reliable, looking at H1 chart with trend confirmed by H4. I will try to post some charts asap

Here's something for you Bob: EU * UJ / AJ * ANZD / GBPNZD = EGBP Do the math. How about I do it for you. 1.31463 * 80.981 / 84.264 * 1.25388 / 1.92092 = .82469 These were the current bids when I did this and it ends up exactly with the EUR/GBP rate. Why? Because that's how it works. It's math. A currency quote is an equation. From what you believe then euros, us dollars, yen, aussie dollars, nz dollars, and pounds just by coincidence are being bought and sold in exact amounts at exact times and it just happens to equal the eurgbp rate at all times. This relationship exists and has to for several different reasons and frankly surprising that someone that has been trading for as long as you have refuses to accept it and/or can't understand it. I am done with this. Nothing else can be said. The proof is right in front of you face. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Yes nice math, interesting isnt it. Tell me after doing all that are you going to buy or sell? It is what I call worthless information. I dont trade the eur/gbp by EU * UJ / AJ * ANZD / GBPNZD is doing. I dont trade the eur/jpy by trading usd/jpy along with eur/usd. I trade the eur/jpy based on what it is doing. Your math formula has nothing to do with price action. That is the point. I understand that all the books around the world need to be balanced. OK. Now if you took all of that and started a thread showing people how they could hedge trade errrrrrrrrrrrr sorry nedge, maybe you got something. Does it give you SL locations, TP locatons, how about entrances and exits? Maybe you could take the formula and come up with a money management formula. It is nice to know the books are balanced. Now if you said when the EU EJ AJ ANZD and GBP/NZD do this then you sell the eur/gbp for a high probability trade then you get my attention. But showing that the books are balanced. Ehhhhhhh............

--- 帖子 #440 ---
You're right. The original topic has nothing to do with hedging/nedging. It just irks me a bit when people start recommending nedging as a way to improve someone's trading, because it is mathematically impossible to do that. It shows inexperience and/or lack of logical thinking. It is fundamental for a trader to understand what is going on "under the hood" when he/she makes a trade. Anyone who nedges, or advocates nedging as an acceptable risk management tool clearly demonstrates a lack of such understanding.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Give me a chance to ask a question here. The USD/JPY and EUR/USD are a moderate volatility pairs. How do you get that to equal a high volitility pair like the eur/jpy. For example the eur/usd has a 29.98% chance of going over 300 pips in one week. The usd/jpy goes over 300 pips in one week 30.57% of the time. How would those two produce a currency EUR/JPY that hits over 300 pips 47.66% of the time if their price actions are not independent from each other?? That would be an interesting answer?? I also believe in my illustration I used that when I buy a car I help the entire car market but the specific deal was done with FORD. Chevy and Toyota dont directly benefit from the sale but the entire industry as a whole does. I tried to make that clear.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
So it went from being "false" to being "true but worthless". That's a step in the right direction . It is also not worthless however, if you consider the relationship in your analysis. Trading opportunities can be confirmed and can sometimes even present themselves to a trader who is aware of the relationships between currency pairs. Still though, as another poster mentioned, this is a bit off topic...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Lonestar...we've been through this on other threads before..some people will never get it. I think every trader should be required to spend a few days with an Excel spreadsheet and MT4 DDE to get a firm understanding of forex math.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
The short answer is that if JPY is strengthening against USD, and EUR is weakening against USD, then it follows that JPY is strengthening even more against EUR. The long answer would be to write this as a mathematical function and to plot it with a mathematical graphing tool (or by hand if you are so inclined). You could even do it in Excel if you don't have access to Matlab/Maple/Mathematica or a graphing calculator. Once you see a visual representation of the function, the answer will be very clear.

Entries? Exits? Buy? Sell? Price action? Why bring that into it? That's completely out of context with the issue at hand. I addressed the issue which was your ignorance on how pairs are related and how a single price change causes a cascading effect across many pairs. But of course instead of admitting you were incorrect in your thinking and being happy you learned something you bring up a bunch of stuff that's not related to the issue we're discussing to try to save face and divert the attention to something else. Typical tactic of a person with a big ego that can't admit their mistakes with humility.

That's Bob for ya. Typical ole Bob. Whenever you pin him into the corner (which happens often btw), he responds with something that has nothing to do with the topic. He will never admit he is wrong even though anyone with half a brain can see it. Unfortunately most of his little cult following on his 10.0 thread don't have half a brain.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I think that's part of his problem. Aside from his ego being too big to admit he's wrong, he feels the need to maintain this illusion that he is a very knowledgeable trader (which sorry to say, but I don't see him as one). He has spent years creating a "system" (more like mess) and getting people to follow him. He feels he can't have his image tarnished. The great teacher can never be wrong! Anyone who challenges him, or better yet, proves him wrong is "misinformed" or "doesn't understand". It's no wonder why he lives in China.

I cant answer every single post but I will discuss some of this. Lonestar, you are first. It is not a problem of understanding the math. I have kept the books of my businesses for decades and took basic accounting in college. What you are describing is basic accounting. In other words the balancing of the books is the same as the balance in FOREX. For every buy there is a sell. For every positive entrance in the ledger their is a negative entrance. So no matter how you look at it the equation will always balance. It is basic accounting 101. The relationship will always balance unless a mistake is made someplace and then it will be balanced out at some point. With today's computer systems these imbalances only appear for very short periods of time. The reason the math works usd/jpy, eur/jpy, and eur/usd as a group is because in accounting everything will always and must balance. For every buy there is a sell. So the math understanding is a simple concept. But making the books balance, which they always will do, has nothing to do with price action and trading. Trading the eur/jpy is independent in each individual transaction as compared to each transaction on the eur/usd and usd/jpy. But the accounting will always balance because that is what must happen with accounting. So trading the usd/jpy and eur/usd is not the same as trading the eur/jpy. Each individual transaction is independent from each other. That is why a tick move in the EUR/JPY does not correspond with a tick move in the USD/JPY and EUR/USD. The math is balanced because that has to happen in accounting. I know my explanation may not be fully understood but you will not get the same results from trading usd/jpy and eur/usd that you would trading the eur/jpy directly. They are three separate markets whose accounting must always balance out. This balancing out in accounting does not make them the same thing market wise. Price action is separate in each currency pair and is not connected with the overall accounting. Does this help you understand the difference??

--- 帖子 #455 ---
I am not arguing the strengths and weaknesses of hedging, whether it is good or bad. I cant use it here in the USA and when I could I only used it a handful of times. Whether you like it or not, agree with it or not, or think it is wise or not--the definition used by every forex dealer, in forex letters, newpapers, articles, newsletters, websites, etc.etc. is to buy and sell on the same currency pair. That is it, fight over everything else if you want to but that is the basic definition. How it is used in other investment fields is different. That has never been the dispute. So accept the definition that is used industry wide and move on.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Sorry I am not, see my post above about your arbitrage. Price action and accounting are two separate issues. If you are short and long in the market you have two separate trades, one long and one short. You are not out of the market. At some point you have to close one trade and find a point to close the other. Then you are out of the market.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Why did you even post this? I am not even talking about how to use a hedge. I only talked about what the definition is. ????

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Arbitrage is the mechanism by which the prices between a cross and its components always stay connected (aside from small oscillations). It has nothing to do with accounting. The only time I mentioned accounting was on the separate topic of hedging being an accounting trick. I can't quite understand how you think a hedged position is not being out of the market. When price changes don't affect the value of your portfolio, you are out of the market (i.e. not exposed to the market). That is what happens when you are "hedged". Once you close one side of the hedge, you have net exposure to the market, so in fact, you didn't close anything - by closing one side of your hedge, you are in effect opening a position in the market. You are an intelligent person so I find it very difficult to see how you are not seeing this for what it is.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Since neither one of us is going to really call the SNB to ask that question, let's continue speculating . I bet you 1000 pips that if you asked anyone at the SNB if hedging was defined that way, they would laugh and hang up. Actually they will refer you to one of their brokers which advertise with them and many of them offer hedging. I know you will never pay your 1000 pips. Show me one place where they said they are banning hedging. What they are doing, is implementing a FIFO rule, which is logical, and therefore doesn't allow for accounting absurdities such as nedging. Oanda and several other reputable brokers (if there is such a thing) never allowed it in the first place - not because they are evil, but because they implement logical accounting standards. They didnt call it hedging,they called it off setting orders. Effective Date of NFA Requirements Regarding Forex Orders NFA has received notice that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has approved new NFA Compliance Rule 2-43 regarding forex orders. The prohibition on carrying offsetting transactions will be effective for any positions established after May 15, 2009. The requirements regarding price adjustments will become effective as to all customer orders executed after June 12, 2009.\ Offsetting Transactions New Compliance Rule 2-43(b) requires an FDM to offset positions in a customer account on a first-in, first-out basis, thereby prohibiting a trading practice commonly referred to as "hedging." Oanda and several other reputable brokers (if there is such a thing) never allowed it in the first place - This statement is a misnomer, Oanda allowed more than one account whereby you could do a sell in one and a buy in the other thereby creating a hedge by using multiple accounts. This is also allowed in IBFX and other brokers. In other words if you really want to hedge you can just takes a little more work and two accounts. I don't think anyone claimed that they move in lockstep (I certainly didn't). What I said was that there is no significant difference for any significant period of time. What that means is that whenever a significant difference does present itself, it is arbitraged away by super fast computer algorithms that participate in the market, and by their very participation, alter prices in such a way as to close the very gaps that they are exploiting. It seems you didn't look up the word arbitrage. I still recommend it. Furthermore, synthetic pairs are generally not calculated using 1:1 lot ratios, and pricing precision is therefore affected further. See my previous post about accounting and price action.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I dont hedge, I cant, unless I use multiple accounts but I dont there either. I have found in practicing it on a demo to be a headache to unhedge the trade. I dont know how you guys ever got to me using hedging. My threads are open to the public and I have written thousands of posts. You havent found me propagating hedging in any of my material. I have mentioned it but it has never been part of any trading strategy of mine other than the only real use I have seen for it is a time out for some reason. It freezes time so you can relax, plan, and think what you want to do next. I find that to be a simple basic use. But that is not available to US brokers. Sheeeeeeesh can you not get that. The only thing i have debated is its definition. In FOREX it is defined as having a buy and sell of the same currency pair. In other fields it is defined differently than other investment fields. Dang.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Still waiting for your wit and wisdom in using SL. Dont worry I am not expecting it, I know you cant teach or train. Head bashing is your best skill. I used to trade around 60% but now am closer to 80% 77.04% to be exact for the last 9 months. If you dont understand that it means almost 23% of my trades are losers. Dang he takes losses.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I never said you used it, but you are defending it as a legitimate way of mitigating risk, which it is not.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I know you know this so put it into practice. When you trade eur/jpy you are buying the eur and selling the jpy or selling the euro and buying the jpy. This will always cause your arbitrage. They will always be in balance. If Toyota sells a car in Germany they will convert the euro to jpy and deposit it into their account in Japan. You have yet to to explain how the transaction which will cause a tick movement on the eur/jpy chart will also cause tick movements on a usd/jpy and eur/usd chart. If it doesnt then it 100% proves my point that arbitrage is not related to price action and is worthless information for trading. However, it makes perect sense in the accounting world. Surely you can conceptualize that a car sold in Germany in Euros and then converted back to JPY for deposit in Japan has no effect on the eur/usd. Really now, is that really that hard to understand?? The eur/jpy will always be in accounting balance, the eur/usd will always be in accounting balance, usd/jpy will always be in accounting balance. Mix and match their totals anyway you want and guess what???? They will always be in balance. What is it that you really think I dont understand???

--- 帖子 #464 ---
No I didnt, I used an illustration of a time I thought it could be used viably. A time out. That is not mitigating risk but freezing it until you decide what you want to do next. People, and that includes you and me, have things happen in which under pressure we would make stupid decisions we normally would not make. Lets say I got a phone call that my older brother had died. I would not want to be trading or making decisions about Forex for awhile. I could just close all my positions, that is true. I would rather just freeze them all with a hedge and come back in a week or two and deal with it. I guess that is a mitigating reason to minimize risk but I would prefer to just call a time out, deal with other issues and come back later, unhedge, and continue trading. That is a whole different concept that using it as a daily trading rule. Surely you can tell the difference between the two concepts?? Cant you??

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Nacho, if you really want to discuss trading your method, you are going to have to ban some people and get them out of here. They will harass you until you quit. They are not here to discuss trading methods and systems but to disrupt and harass. I love trading the 4H chart and somtimes use the 5 or 4 MA. So I look forward to some discussions. I will refrain from engaging them any further. Better get your arbitrage trading methods ready though or you are going to lose out.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
What's the connection between arbitrage and accounting? Arbitrage is a way of taking advantage of price differences between things that are supposed to have the same price. By engaging in this type of arbitrage, you are buying the instrument that is "underpriced" and selling the instrument that is "overpriced", and taking profit once the prices realign. You will notice of course, that the side effect of buying the underpriced instrument is a rise in its price, and the shorting of the overpriced instrument results in lowering its price, so the equilibrium is always kept between EUR/USD, USD/JPY and EUR/JPY. This has very little to do with accounting, and everything to do with the way financial markets operate. As I said, the only time I mentioned accounting was when saying that hedging is an accounting trick. You can always replicate a hedging strategy with a hedgeless strategy, and you will be better off to boot (paying less spread, paying less interest, and possibly even using less margin). This is why the definition that is used by so many retail forex outfits is misleading and even predatory to inexperienced traders. BTW, the SNB can refer me to any broker they want - it doesn't mean that they hedge in this way. In fact I guarantee you that they don't, and I am pretty sure that they laugh at anyone who does (if they are even aware of its existence). Offsetting Transactions New Compliance Rule 2-43(b) requires an FDM to offset positions in a customer account on a first-in, first-out basis, thereby prohibiting a trading practice commonly referred to as "hedging." Exactly - they call it "offsetting transactions". That means they offset (cancel) one another. They are requiring first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting, which has the effect of removing the illogical practice of "hedging". They even put "hedging" in quotes and say that the practice is commonly referred to as "hedging", and not defined as hedging. The definition of real hedging is something completely different. Please don't propagate this as anything but a way for brokers to milk more money out of inexperienced traders. Tell people to just close their positions instead of "hedging". Furthermore, you say you don't hedge because you can't, due to the US regulations. Then you go on to say that Oanda does allow hedging in two separate accounts, but that makes it too much of a bother.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
DUH. This is FF and we are here to discuss trading. Great sentence though, made me laugh. If Arbitrage cant be used to trade why discuss it? Great one there.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I agree with that wholeheartedly. You should have ended your post there . There is no difference between the concepts. It is the same concept. By hedging, you are closing your position, but paying for it. It makes no sense. There is no such thing as "freezing" your position. It's either open or it is closed. You are either exposed to the market or you are not. That's all there is to it. All this hedging stuff just obscures the truth that you are either in or you are out.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Yes I understand that relationship but that is just knowing your basic fundamentals. Forget some of this garbage. You would probably be interested in a project i am working on then. What I want to have is the 1MA median on a screen and then overlay all the others on the screen from a single currency. For example: If I could overlay the aud/nzd, aud/usd, aud/cad, aud/chf, aud/jpy etc. on one screen and suddenly one of them took off. Would that not be a great indication that the others would follow?? Anyway, that is something I am working on with some programmers now. See how it goes and would be easier to see the direction of certain currencies. One pair becomes the predictor of the others.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Exactly, freezing would remove my exposure to the market until I was in a better mental and emotional position to do so. That is the one benefit I see of it. Thank you for making it very clear.

I dont even know where to begin with this humdinger??? So if I was to read between the lines it goes something like this. Bob: "Shit my trade has really tanked and I dont want to take a loss" "I dont want to give the game playing broker my money" "I have no clear exit strategy" "WTF do I do ???" "OK I will hedge(freeze) my position until I figure out how to get myself oout of this mess" "OH...I know, I will Martingale (Recovery multi-level ) snicker snicker I'm so smart back into B/E" "Add 1 more contract,,shit its still going south, add 3 more ,OHOH add 4 more contracts whew....made it too B/E " Bob, now I am trying too help you. Please go get from your library or store some trading psych books. I seriously think you need them. Good Luck Bob. Bluesteele PS Sometimes its best to be a man about things and if your trade is FUBAR'd on ya.. Close the mother out completely. Close out all of your trades and do whatever it is you need to do to get your head on strait then and only then think about going back into the market. Your posts speak volumes about you. You are combative and absolutely hate being wrong and that is 100% the reason you trade thev way you do with hedging and martingaling. It is the reason you brag about your win/loss%. Help yourself out and go read some trading psych books...

--- 帖子 #472 ---
But this benefit is an illusion. It is the same as closing your position, except for two little tidbits - you PAY an extra spread, and you PAY overnight interest on longer timeframe trades. Just close your position normally, deal with the emotional stuff, then come back and re-enter the market the way it's done in the real world (i.e. not the magical world of retail forex where buying and selling the same thing at the same time somehow does not offset).

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Unfortunately no... You would have to take into consideration the crosses between nzd, usd, cad, chf and jpy. What the arbitrage example we have been doing does is this: Say we have EUR/USD = 1.2000 USD/JPY = 100.00 EUR/JPY = 119.00 Theoretically, what you could do in that case is calculate the synthetic EUR/JPY by multiplying 1.2000 * 100.00 = 120.00 and seeing that the "real" cross is at 119.00. Knowing full well that those two prices should be identical, you decide to exploit the idea of arbitrage. You buy EUR/JPY @119.00, you short EUR/USD @ 1.2000 and you short USD/JPY @ 100.00 (you would have to calculate the appropriate quantities of each, so you're not left with any net exposure). At this point you don't care where any of the pairs go - the only thing you care about is that EUR/USD * USD/JPY = EUR/JPY will be back, and you profit. Of course, in reality, you will never see a 100 pip gap between EUR/JPY and its components, precisely because several algorithms will do what we just did long before the gap gets that wide, and by doing so, will actually close the gap. A gap that is too small can't be exploited because spread and/or slippage would destroy your profits, and a gap that is big enough to exploit doesn't happen too often (though I have seen it happening between different broker feeds, and have made money from it - it is not a strategy to depend on). Basically it's you and your home PC with a DSL connection to your slow ass dealer vs. purpose-built machines running assembly coded algorithms connected directly to banks by fibre. You won't come out on top too many times.

I used to try to take advantage of the Sunday gaps. I would place some trades just before closing on Friday with the idea that the gap would give me a nice big profit when the market opened Sunday. When it worked great, when it didnt ............. oh well. Maybe my word meaningless was harsh, better phrase, not worth my time to trade would be better. I think if you go back to my car sales illustration and change GM to Mercedes, I think you will see that I do understand the relationship and how if affects overall pricing.

That is not what I would be looking for. If one of the currencies goes south first will it indicate that the rest will do also? This is not arbitrage and does not deal with that subject. All you would have to do on the other pairs is to set up some pending sells below a pivot or support on the other pairs. If they follow you are in, if not you aren't. It is a follow the pack mentality, anyway until I get some kind of one chart indicator showing this, it is too hard to do with multiple charts. There are some real programming issues, like getting a currency that is trading at 1.60 to show on the screen around the same location as one that trades at 1.30 or 2.70.

Fair enough. Maybe now we can give the OP his thread back .

Providing that you have the discipline to stick to your system, and courage to pull the trigger on a loss when needed. I have a system similar that I have been using on my small account. I have attached the trade list so you can see it's not hard to go weeks at a time without a loss. Notice I took a 488. dollar loss a few days ago. That was a manual trigger. Got tired of holding. sometimes being stuck in a drawdown for days is as bad as taking a hit. I've recovered half of that back at present, and anticipating to have whole loss fully recovered plus some by Monday's close.

Obviously unbeknownst to you there are many many aspects to trading and very few, if any I am rapidly discovering, that you have even a basic grasp. Do you actually think that every aspect of trading can be discussed at once? Let me clue you in. The answer is a resounding no. Certain things need to be completely understood to move on to other aspects. Until you understand the mechanics of pair movement in relation to other pairs you won't understand arb. And arb had nothing to due with the issue that was being discussed. Nor did entries or exits or price action or anything you tried to divert the attention to and away from your ignorance. There are some knowledgeable traders around here Bob and if you would drop the attitude and closed mind and stop acting like a child you might learn something and not be the joke here. Case in point, your new saying quoting the formula I used to show you how pair are inextricably linked in a mathematical way. Now you added to trade it and you will be a success. That's hilarious that that was your take away from it. Once again it shows how little you know about trading and how you lash out at people that are trying to help you and act like a child. I am hoping that wasn't your take away from that post because if it was you're even more of an idiot than you already shown yourself to be. Grow up.

I see range trading 3040 as the bottom of range, 3470 as top. 3540 main target, 3600 slippage where i will start considering shorts down to 2600 Not for April's monthmy bar without reaching the 3540 area first. Won't get into specifics on my system, but I don't use stop loss orders.

But judgign from this statement, am I right to say you have a mental stop. A point at which you know you will exit a losing position should it reach that point. I'm still not a fan of mental stops probably because the different style of trading does not allow me to do so (or that I'm just not large enough to bother ). But it is still a stop of some sort.

Ouch... He wont change. He's been repeatedly told of his errors in thinking but absolutely refuses to acknowledge them. You must realize Bob has repeatedly said he is a 3Dimensional thinker and how the rest of us are so closed minded. He thinks I am joking when I say he needs to take a step back from trading and read or re-read some books on trading psychology. Oh well, guess were not all cut out to be traders. Good Luck Bob !

Yes.. Those 2 losses were when I strayed from my system. 15 pip loss I wasn't paying attention, and 488 pip loss the entry was not according to my system. the entry was triggered along with the tp of a previous trade. i strayed away from my system, and attempted to play a range trade. after holding a negative for a week, I looked for signals according to my system, cut the trade, took the loss, and proceeded to trade strickly according to my system. in summary, when I trade directly in compliance to my system, i don't use any stops. but am still smart enough to know when to cut a trade off. that 488 didn't give me any signals that it would retrace anytime soon, so I cut it and have made half back already. Have a good one!

A good trader never, ever takes a loss, but often postpones a win by temporarily withdrawing from the market. Yes, certain numbers on the screen will now be slightly smaller, but he's smart enough not to be fazed by that. He knows he has an edge. There will be many more opportunities. Two steps forward. One step back. Just quietly plug away.

HUH ? You talking drawdown, mental stops voodoo magic? How about successful traders never ever add to a losing position.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
At the end of the year, if a trader is in the black, he has not taken a loss. He has taken many steps back from the market, but these are not losses or failures, but are necessary to better position himself for the next attack. If he takes a trade and it goes against him, he exits until a better opportunity becomes clear. By doing so, he isn't losing. He's gaining. True, the balance goes down temporarily, but these are just numbers on the screen. It's like a boxer stepping back. Not only does he avoid his opponent's punch, it gives him a better chance to get in a good one of his own. This is how I see it, anyway.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
you are right, by doing this way i'm sacrificing some profit actually, but at the same time this limits somehow the risk to remain hanging on a trade for days if something goes wrong, and I can free margin pretty quickly so I can enter new trades

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Allan, I agree, and I would take it one step further than that. Let's use some hypothetical numbers. Suppose at the end of the year I am +5000 pips. However, during the year I exited one loss at -100. If I'd exited that loss at -50, my end of year total would have been +5050. In other words, cutting losses earlier can, in certain situations, improve your bottom line. The key is to view overall bottom line, not the result of individual trades. The obvious question is: " but if I exit all of my losses at (for example) -50, instead of -100, how many potential winners would I cut off in the process? " That comes down to trading expertise; knowing where to optimally, on average, exit a loss. As such, an edge needs to be based on probabilities offered by the market, i.e. by considering where price is most likely, on average, price is likely to reverse (example: confluences of different S/R types), rather than simply trading on the basis of whether the current trade is winning or losing, which the market cares nothing about. A quick word about mental SLs, which were being discussed earlier. Obviously these work only if you're willing to continuously monitor the price action (if you leave a position unattended for a few minutes, and price suddenly crashes through your mental SL, you're stuffed). A physical SL allows you to trade more objectively, by leaving the computer to babysit your trade for you. Again, it's my view that SL location should be determined by technical criteria (after which you size your position, to set your risk). Unless this technical criteria changes as the trade unfolds (e.g. new S/R levels, or supply/demand areas, are formed), or there are other statistically proven reasons, one is really only adjusting the SL on the basis of guesswork and hope. Hence one might as well use a physical SL, and be done with it. David

However, if you had been patient with the trade and it exited at +50 you would have +5150 pips for the year. You see there is the other side of the argument you all forget to deal with. Once you take a too quick SL it is permanent. The issue here is always presented as whether or not someone uses a SL. I have pointed out that my losses account for 20% of my trades. It just never dawns on these people that there are losses. We just take many fewer ones that is all. But we have been down this road before. It is easier to just call people stupid and dumb and idiotic (and I dont mean you do this Hanover) than to realize that using smaller lots and leverage means you can stay within the ranges of of currency pairs. Here is a pic for the gbp/cad. I have taken very few SL on any GBP pair because for the last 3 years they have all stayed in a certain range. Once you see that on a monthly chart you start selling at the top of the range and buying at the bottom. There is no need to take a SL because you just play its range. See pic below. Once you see this it becomes very simple to trade some of these currencies. But who am I to tell others. While you guys have been bashing me to no end that last couple of weeks I have received 10 PM from traders thanking me for showing them how to become profitable traders. It works whether you believe me or not. I dont write to win an argument, I write so others can see there is an easier way to trade. I can go to bed and leave all my trades running. If after another two years, 6 years or 2 months, the gbp changes its ranges then I will change mine and do it all over again. It is the nature of currencies to do this because of Macro economics but I aint going down that road. These guys dont even understand that all currencies must balance accounting wise so their math formulas will always show balance. If you cant understand that simple concept you certainly wont understand anything else. Sorry I used your post to rant and rave Hanover, this wasnt really directed at you at all. BS you still havent enlightened us on the proper use of a SL.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Yes. Determining the exit so it fits some arbitrary r:r criteria, or having a trailing stop of some sort basically randomizes every second trade you take, which isn't the smartest move. (The exit should be seen as a trade in its own right.) I hate losing. Psychologically, I find it far better to view the exit from a bad trade as a temporary strategic withdrawal than a loss. Again, a good boxer weaves and ducks and sways as the fight progresses, quickly stepping into the action and out again, minimizing personal risk while watching for that fleeting, high-probability opportunity to strike.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Bob, Indeed we have been down this road before. And as I have said before, I don’t doubt that you’re profitable. However, by “using smaller lots and leverage”, you’re restricting the size of your profitable trades commensurately. For example, if (and the numbers are hypothetical) I have to trade my account at 0.01 lots per trade merely to allow enough space to recover from a 1,000 pip loss, then I’m only making 1/10 of the profit that a trader who limits his losses to 100 pips, and trades at 0.1 lots. Also, while I’m waiting for losing trades to return to breakeven, there is an opportunity cost, as my capital can’t be redeployed into more profitable opportunities elsewhere. You say that 20% of your trades are losses. If you had cut those losses earlier, then your bottom line would have been better, although it likewise begs the question asked in my previous post: Your choice of GBPCAD as a ranging pair is a good one IMO, as GBP and CAD tend to be, correlation-wise, ‘middle of the road’ currencies, and the chart you posted reflects that result. It’s impossible to beat a random game. If I may generalize, the reason forex is potentially conquerable is that trends exist that are qualitatively different from those that would be produced by a random number generator. If we can show that forex prices trend frequently and far enough to make a trend following strategy viable, then it makes sense to cut losses quickly, and let profits run, because once a pair starts moving in a certain direction on a given horizon, the probability that it will continue moving in that direction exceeds 50%. If our trade is in sync with that direction, then it makes sense to leave it open, and attempt to maximize our profit. Conversely, if we find ourselves on the wrong side of a market move, then the probability that things will get worse before they get better likewise exceeds 50%, and it makes sense to revert to net flat (whether by exiting or hedging, it makes no difference) to arrest the growing loss. I understand that this is the opposite line of thought to mean reversion, i.e. (as you say) “what goes up must eventually come down”. It is possible to make money either way. However, I prefer to swim with the prevailing tide than against it, because that’s where the highest probability of a big move lies. My focus is risk-adjusted return, i.e. maximizing profit, and minimizing loss. If I can increase the size of my winners, and decrease the size of my losers, then I’m better off on two counts. It is not the only way to trade, I grant you, but it works well enough for me. David

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Yes we have, anyway, the bottom line I think is this. Probably less than 10% of traders consistently year after year are profitable. I have proven myself to be one of them and so have you. Always a pleasure to talk to you. One last thing I believe the regs making 10:1 leverage will become law at some point in the future. How will that affect your trading? I basically am already there even though my account is 50:1 on the main pairs and 25:1 on the others. So I wont have to adjust when they make the change.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Leverage has almost no effect on a trader with stops if that is what you want to know. In fact, leverage only affects traders with no stops.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
If the laws affect traders with accounts outside of the US, then they could cramp my style, as I usually need around 50:1, when I have multiple positions open. Hence my ROE would be reduced commensurately. However, perhaps my biggest worry is the prospect that spot forex might not be available to the retail trader shortly: [EDIT] don't want to hijack this thread any further, but I've posted an example of a method that performs the complete opposite of what the OP is suggesting, namely the aggressive use of SLs to create the possibility of high RR trades.

Here you go big boy. An article about the big traders and how they trade. Read it and weep. You have proven over and over again that you know absolutely nothing of this world. The sharp correction for EURUSD up from 1.3000 to 1.3145 at the start of this week has left many pundits bewildered. They are struggling to understand the strength of the Euro, pointing to several factors of nonsense – while in reality it is due to one very simple fact, which short-term players will never understand. The daily chart shows a clear line of support in the area 1.3025-1.2975 – tested on several occasions since late January. Every time visited, there has been a pretty sharp bounce from this level within a short time. It is not a technical reason for this, which is why pundits have problem understanding what is going on and it is not to be seen in the trading habits of those they follow or from any statistics that is available (COT). So what is it then? It is for the same reason as seen for any major EURUSD turning level over the last 4 years – it is a level where long-term money has an interest. Short-term traders – among which the crowd or retail traders now has become dominant, has an outlook no longer than to their nose tip – give and take 40 pips. Whenever they go short – and they do it like sheep – they cover their shorts whenever they are this number of pips “in the money” or through stops for a similar distance whenever they are “out of money”. Whatever they do – as a group - they cap the move. Long-term money – which is few as a group but big in volume – is looking for distances. Whenever they buy or sell, the outlook is for 750+ pips. They don’t use stops and they have time to wait. They enter from a mixture of fundamental thinking, a level more than a fixed price, high confidence factor – and by bidding, not taking out offers whenever they are buyers – and offering, not hitting bids whenever they are sellers. 1.30 +/- 25 pips can be justified as an attractive entry level for a long-term long EURUSD position. I have advocated my bearish USD long-term view on several occasions and shall not repeat this here. But those views are shared by a few investors of magnitude. In foreign exchange we talked a lot about “leads” and lags” some 20 years ago. Today – you hardly hear the expressions mentioned. Well – it is time to bring them back again – and the reason is that there are hundreds of billions of delayed purchases of EURUSD waiting for the right moment to make the entry. These are “lags” soon to turn “leads”. The amount is from sovereign wealth funds, central banks and substantial investors who do not see the attraction in USD, from the simple thinking that it is yielding 0% and it is too much of the currency floating around. The reason their purchases of EURUSD is delayed is simply from the political uncertainty about the Euro-zone ability to protect the currency and its markets through a sufficient firewall instrument and a well supporting central bank. That proves now to be the case and with the fiscal cooperation now coming into place – the Euro-zone is getting its act together. This was a missing confidence factor for a long time. Now the confidence is coming together. And long-term money likes it. So – on the occasions over the last 3 months when short-term players have sold themselves short at the lower level of 1.3000 – there has been long-term money bidding for these funds – not returning them to the short-term players and hence leaving the short-term players to cover their shorts in among themselves and themselves only. Long-term money will not be offering their EURUSD for a long time to come – or more correctly as time is not critical for them – at a very different level from where we are. 1.4500-1.5250 is more the level they have in mind. Short-term traders will never understand how long-term money thinks or acts. Short-term traders think the market is made only from players who think like they do. That is why they don’t understand what happened yesterday and those who comment on the market are equally bewildered. They only talk to short-term players and have no clue to what the REAL position takers are doing. That is how the FX market is, that is why certain EURUSD levels become milestones and that is why a few in this market win while most traders lose.

No one doubts you're high winning rate. What is questionable is the method you trade and amount you are risking to get that high win rate. Risk is proportional to reward. There is no way around it no matter how fancy your money management.

That's exactly right. All one is doing is playing a mind game when they hedge. A mind game that actually costs them money.

I have a thread I once started on trading the gap before close and after open. It was essentially a stab at double or nothing. The only risk was that the gap wouldn't close which is unusual. See here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=234477

I used to love hedgeing. Take now for example. I have a signal with a target of 3025, and a signal with a target of 3182. would love to be able to shoot for both targets using the same margin, instead of trying to guess which target will be hit first. Oh well guess that's what I get for being a U.S citizen.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Exactly. The funny thing is I pointed this out to Bob a while back ago. I pretty much asked what is he going to do with the open trades that are hundreds of pips in the red when the required margin becomes greater due to regulation. This clearly crushes the trader-without-stops' strategy. Yet he now mentions it as a benefit to trading without stops. Poor bob has his head screwed on backwards.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Yea, using the same margin you can't in the US. However, you can still execute the strategy with a second account - although double the margin. Contrary to what one might believe, I do advocate taking positions that just happens to create a hedge in some circumstances, if the entries and exits are independent of each other. In other words the trade setup/plan is based off different time frames. I actually listed this type of trading style on my website. Again, the intent is to not create a hedge, just trading two different setups that happen to make a hedge. Also, the hedge is not completely offset due to differing position sizes since multiple time frames. In most cases one results in a loss and one results in a profit. In some cases, although not frequent, both trades result in profit. Never do both trades result in loss if you know how to set it up properly. Of course both trades need to be based off of something that gives you an edge such as S/R.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Actually leverage effects the number of positions you can take. The lower the leverage the fewer positions you can take. It also effects the lot size you can use. If you are a one in one out trader yes it has very little effect.

This SL vs. No SL debate is endless and traders on both sides have shown with their method a trader can be profitable either way. However, I believe the real difference is the amount of return on your investment potential each of those successful methods can generate. I have traded both methods successfully over my 10 years of trading and the use of a SL allows you to generate more income from your investment. Now I did clarify my criteria as both methods being successful for the basis of my opinion. Use of a SL is not easy to master, however once mastered the profits are immense. Early in my career I used one and quickly found out I was a poor trader. However, over the past 12 months I have studied, learned and conquered my past failure of the use of a SL in a system. So, it is very possible and profitable to use a SL and for it to be very small to maximize your position size. Here is an example from a trade I took this evening. This is a classic reversal pattern where prior resistance turns support. I have drawn the green line to show the downtrend, which also shows where support and resistances areas are developed. I have drawn a maroon box to show the levels. We get a trendline break, a break through previous resistance and the test of new support. The 81.19 line defines the level which we can establish our risk to set a position size and is our new support. In this trade, I planned 15 pip stop at 81.09. You can see the low is 81.17, so this went past my projected support by 2 pips. That is all. The RR on this trade is 15 pips risk and the next resistance line provides 60 pips profit. A 1:4 ratio. These patterns happen over and over, where you have a very high level of confidence about the outcome. I hope that is helpful and I think both can produce profits, but for me it really boils down to how well you use your investment. Good Trading to you all. George

--- 帖子 #513 ---
So, if Bob has a consistently high winning rate because of his disproportionate R:R, is that a flawed trading strategy? If there's no way of going around or over proportional R:R, then shame on Bob for not adhering to proportional R:R

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Jack, many thanks for the kind words. You might be interested in this thread where folk are claiming 10%-30% returns, not per year, but PER WEEK. Even though this sounds way too good to be true, I believe that it's possible, and in my post here I explain why. I use SLs because I personally hate drawdown. I can't stomach watching positions move against me for too long, and my money slowly disappearing down a black hole. But everybody is different. That's a big reason why these discussions are interesting. Bottom line is that if somebody is happy with the return that they're making, and is comfortable with the level of risk involved, then that's their personal choice. Nobody can argue with that. Good trading to you, I wish you great success. George, I agree with you entirely. S/R and trendlines can give great low risk entries, which I've attempted to show elsewhere. There are some great techniques in these threads: here and here . If you can get low risk entries/high RR trades on a TF that allows high frequency trading, and therefore rapid opportunity for compounding, the sky is the limit. I wish you continued success also. David

Depends what you want risk to reward. As I have said before my SL are based on percentages rather than a fixed pip rate. Goes something like this: SL percent of account =1%. On a 2000 dollar account if you trade 1 dollar lot size 1% SL would be 20 pips, a dime = 200 pips and a penny would equal 2000 pips. Lower lots size gives you more trading room and therefore a higher rate percentage of winners. Risk to reward is not measure as a ratio of 4:1 or 2:1 but wins versus losses. I am not adverse to taking the 20-40 pips during the JPY session, 30-60 during he euro session and the 50-100 during the USA session. The problem I have with the you cannot trade any other way crowd and must follow our rules crowd is if you change the rules, they will crucify you. I have taken 920 trades so far this year and only 10 have hit my 1% loss limit. That means my risk is 1% potential max loss on every trade I take. In other words for every 100 trades I make only 1 hits my maximum risk of 1% of my account. I have had three of the ten go a little longer and hit 1.5%. So I dont think my risk to reward is off at all. Again you are only defining things within the, these are the only rules parameters. I believe my system is basically risk free and returns 7-10% a month. I don't doubt you can earn more but consistency and regular return is what I look for and what I want. Low risk, great reward, unless you are stupid enough to think 10% a month is a lousy return.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
@fxtr51 if i understand you correctly with the lock-unlock method you place a 'hedge' trade at the point where usually a SL happens and freeze this loss. later with a new signal you unfreeze the loss for a potential BE or profit, but also a potential risk that this floating loss getting bigger. It will make more sense to do this with the TP instead SL and take the loss and bigger up the profits, because then the losses will be linear but the profits grows exponential.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
My post could of been worded better. I was not questioning his win rate or his monthly return up to now. Quite frankly I don't care. When I said bob's method is questionable, I meant that his method is left open to high degrees of ruin because he does not put a cap on his loss from the moment the trade is placed. He basically just diddle daddles with trade entries and then says he looks to trim losses when the cumulative drawdown of all open trades reaches 20% - or whatever it is nowadays. Also, I've posted many times that it is possible to trade profitably without a stop loss. My whole contention with bob is that a no-stop method cannot outperform a stop loss method so long as the trader executing the stop loss method does it properly. It's basic math that explains higher trade turnover (with an edge) with greater position sizes = greater profit due to compounding (as compared to some quasi-averging down strategy). Bob's method, the way he describes it, is a mess in my opinion. He's basically carry trading and averaging down with some sort of martingale element for recovery. Like I said it's a mess and he has no edge or mechanism to prevent large losses. Since he lacks these he cannot compound his gains. So long as he refuses to learn how to trade with a stop loss he will never double his account in a year without extremely good luck. And if he does get lucky one year eventually he will lose it and be set back years because his strategy is not sustainable due to the vulnerability of big drawdowns. So many traders neglect time and opportunity cost. I find neglecting those equates to much less profit long term. If you want to be a carry trader (more like investor) I wish you luck. I find it more profitable to do actual (real) trading. With all that said, no one is wrong and no one is right. We all have different preferences. Perhaps the biggest difference we have, which leads to these lengthy debates, is brought on by our goals and preferences. I have choosen to aim very high. I'm looking for aggressive growth at the expense of less room for error. Which for some can lead to higher stress. Someone who is looking to just gain a steady 10-20% annually (averaged) without any stress may opt for the low leverage without stops loss approach like bob. Again, just a matter of preferences and goals.

There are many ways to manage the lock-unlock method. And you can trade using SL profitably too. It is a matter of taste. We haven´t discussed ideas like yours because of the SL-missionaries and I will not continue to discuss anything in this thread .... because I need to watch my trades and do other things.

For me I am at the copy machine at school and messing with these guys is better than staring out the window at a group of kindergarten kids. At least 2+2 has clearly delineated our differences. It is not that I havent tried what he is talking about, it is because of my work schedule I only have a few moments every 4-6 hours to trade. So if I trade like him all I ever did was miss trades. Easier just to set them up in the morning when I get up and then monitor them several times a day. That is why I have a lot of people who follow my threads. They have to trade like I do.

are you implementing or evaluating the lock-unlock method in some ways? maybe the method will work for profits too. and maybe better then with SL.

I do not agree with you. You can trade profitably without the stop-loss. If the right to develop a strategy using martingale, we can make a profit without risk of losing all the money. My expert works without stop for over a year, and my account for the year increased by more than 30 times...

Hi Nacho I have been using a strategy with a live account now since Jan 2012. I have never used a stop loss. I started with 1,000. I use only 0.01 micro lots. I learnt a lot using this method. I planned this strategy, but not good enough. The things I learnt from this starategy is to use the pairs that have positive swap rates. Look at the big picture first (the forest) before entering a position, evaluate the price and ask yourself the question is it good value. Look at the week, day, 4h. timeframe. Then you know if things go against you have opened a position with good value and your getting interest every day. And on wednesday the interest is triple. Today i closed EURTRY 0.01. Open position -5.63 and interest +8.04 = +2.47. Iam still learning with this strategy and i have made some mistakes. Thats why i have a balance as of today of Eur 3,500 and Equity Eur 1,663. You learn from your mistakes but at leat i havent lost any money so far. I just have a large open position which I know in time will sort it self out. I also use the correlation tables to balance things out. Stop loss is not a must but in my opinion i would use high leverage if yoiur planning to use more pairs. High leverage for me is my insurance and open positions are my working capital. Plan everything correctly and think of all the pitfulls and you will be a winner at the end of the year.

I cant hedge so I can only theorize. They say if you hedge you are doing nothing but that isnt true. That is only true if you close both positions at the same time. If they are closed at different times then they are two separate trades with different results. If you close one at +100 and the other at -50 then your net is +50. That is not a nothing trade. I see no problem in hedging to ride out a bad situation and coming back to when the markets are more to your liking. The concept is fairly easy to understand. You may have a winning position but dont want to lose your profit in an upcoming news story so you hedge it to take yourself out of that news story. After the market has resettled you can then bank the saved profit or you can continue the winning profit if you so see fit. But of course we know there are people who cant comprehend more than one thing happening at a time.

A method without a stop loss that increased your account 30x in one year is hard to believe. Forgive me for not believing you at your word. In order to survive deep drawdowns your position sizes must be very small (relative to your account size). How did you increase your balance by 30x in one year with such small position sizes? Was it cause you were very aggressive in averaging down/martingaling? If so, then you are bringing stop loss into the equation (margin call) and contradicting everything you said. I'm willing to bet that IF you did achieve this, then you started with money you never cared to lose. That's the only way you would have been so aggressive and taken such a serious risk of large loss. Otherwise it's irresponsible to trade that way long term. I would never trust an investor with my money if they said they could increase my account by 30x a year. In fact, I would run away from that person as fast as I could.

You can find a lot of systems on myfxbook (and the like) that use martingale type risk management without stops (just keeps adding or holding) and show "realized profits" of many multiples of their initial deposit. HOWEVER , their account equity is often right around their initial deposit since they are floating huge losses on open positions. It's just an accounting shift. Realized profit, R multiples, many hundreds of trades for adequate sample size, and a flat account is what you should measure by when comparing systems. I often say there's no "wrong" way to trade so long as it's profitable... but martingale and holding losers are the two main things I'll speak out against since there's so much proven statical evidence that shows such things fail in the long run.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I think that's where alot of people decieve themselves. They only look at realized figures and completely ignore the floating loss. Of course all that really matters is your equity. Well said Jack.

I see hedging/nedging and trading two different setups on different timeframes as separate things - so long as either of the stop losses or take profits of both trades are not at the same price. But hedging for the sake of reducing exposure to one direction or "freeze time" is just plain dumb and noob-like. It is costlier to be hedged than to be completely out of the market because difference in swap is always to brokers favor. That is a fact. Furthermore, there is no hedged outcome that couldn't be replicated by straightforward (one directional) trade(s).

[quote=Pipsgeek;5531099]Stoploss is normally preferred over take profit. Stoploss prevents blowing your account, take profit prevents profiting 100 pips instead of 30. It's going to succeed until it doesn't and then you will lose all your profits and even more because of spread. If you wait and wait and wait you will not make any profit during that time because if you expose more capital you run the risk of busting your account despite not using leverage. It depends on the amount of TP he can pull below the big looser...it´s all math... How many TP of 30 pips in a 1000, 2000,3000 pip move? How many are hanging there with a big unrealized loss? Well calculated it should make money...BUT it needs to be very very well calculated... What are the chances of EURUSD going to 0, soon??? A stock could though...that´s similar to commodities...how can sugar be worth 0? Big questions...Best is to lock some profit, and more profit , and more profit to digest the black holes... Talk about gambling... If you succeed, your broker will hate you...wish you the best...

It is obvious that we have some broker moles in the forum. They work hard to fight against no stoploss strategies because such strategies ( if traded reasonably ) will make the trader win always and hurt the criminal broker. Look here how brokers manipulate prices: Inserted Video

You notice how self-proclaimed Pro traders rag hedging, call it nedging. Nedging doesnt exist but hedging does. India has position on hedging for its banks and large corp. customers, Hedge and protect your assets. I guess these unprofessional newbies traders in India should read BlueSteele famous book on using a SL that he was going to publish a month ago. LOL never see the light of day. MUMBAI -- India's central bank Monday urged companies to hedge a larger portion of their currency exposures, saying that any foreign-exchange losses incurred by the firms could hurt their creditor banks. "Corporates take a view on the exchange rate... and then decide whether to hedge or not to hedge... If we are looking for a safer system, then we will have to gear up on our hedging in a better way, " Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Anand Sinha said in a speech to an industry lobby. "We are not saying that 100% hedging should be there, but unhedged positions should be limited," he said. The risk due to the Indian rupee's volatility has increased as the fast-growing emerging market is deepening its linkages with the global economy. The RBI's call to ramp up hedging comes as the rupee has lost about 3% against the U.S. dollar due to a sharp drop in capital inflows amid concerns over proposed changes to India's tax laws. The dollar was last trading at 52.56 rupees. A number of software exporters such as Infosys Ltd. are opting to go light on hedges as they expect the rupee to remain weak against the dollar. A weak rupee benefits exporters when they convert overseas revenue into the local currency. But, they forfeit that gain if they had locked into forward contracts to sell dollars at a lower exchange rate. In February, the RBI released guidelines asking banks to evaluate the risks from unhedged foreign currency exposure of their clients and price credit accordingly. Banks were also asked to have their boards come out with a policy stipulating limits to the currency exposure that their clients can leave unhedged. The RBI had imposed limits on currency positions that banks themselves can leave unhedged overnight after the rupee fell to a record low of 54.2925 to the dollar on Dec. 15. It subsequently eased those limits on a case-by-case basis.

Bob... I don't understand why you want to turn this into an English language fight. You can be right that in the book, the term hedgding means going long and short in the same pair (for forex). But when it comes to making money, it does not help one bit. As a retail speculator, hedging is bad for you because you are paying money for no reason. The situation is different as a bank, you can hedge and still be paid premiums. They have other sources of incomes that benefit from the said "hedge". In fact, they might not even get charged for hedging because they are the ones providing liquidity in the first place. They are "the" forex market. So to them, the only drawback of hedging is that they will make less profits. They can hedge till the end of time and come out positive. I have explained before that if you hedge with different instruments, such as futures and options, backed by a kind of asset (such as real physical commodity or stocks) you can also be paid premiums for your hedge. You can essentially hold your position until the end of time and still come out with a profit. If you hedge in forex (buy and sell in the same pair), you will pay premiums. If you hold it till the end of time, you will lose money. Which is why we say it is a bad idea.

Actually I did a sorta hedge trade Friday. Both trades were winners. First price went down on the eur/cad, had a sell just below its previous low and made a profit and a buy above its previous high and it went for a profit. The key to hedge trades is not what they are doing when you enter but when you exit. They both can go for a profit. I could have done the same thing with a hedge trade. My mind is not as closed or limited in what you can do with it than yours is. You can enter both at the same time but you dont have to exit at the same time. But I am not going to beat this dead horse anymore. I just want to point out that there are uses for it whether you like it or not or see any purpose in it or not. People successfully use hedges to decrease their risk in Forex or temporarily get out of a market move they dont like. To protect your assets is not a meaningless trade.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I reply to this at the risk of being accused as a broker mole by you again. Although maybe not this time since I will be agreeing with some of what you said. I don't think you will find many people on here that will argue with you whether brokers have reasons to cheat or not. Just think of it... they spend alot of money on servers, telecommunications equipment, software development and integration, marketing (ads), staff, training staff, physical location, etc. Do you think they just want to provide you with a service that could cost them even more money when you profit? NO. They are in business to profit and spend alot of money in order to profit. Some, like FXCM and Gain Capital (aka Forex.com), even have an "obligation" to their shareholders to profit - although that doesn't really mean crap. My MetaTrader experience (early days of trading for me): When I was very new to forex I thought MetaTrader (MT4) was great, but not too long after did I start to really dislike it, and worse, distrust it. As a noob I remember thinking how great it was that I could be away from home working or doing whatever and a "robot" (EA) could be used to trade on the platform. After testing many EA's I found a couple that I felt should work with some tweaking. The tweaking involved some very conservative money management in the form of lot sizing and the strategies were sound on paper and verified through backtesting as well as forward testing. Up to this point I had learned enough to know that you have to position yourself small and build from there otherwise you will be overleveraged and death (figuratively speaking) comes shortly after. Well at first these few selected EA's did work until one day they suddenly didn't. And I don't mean that the strategy didn't work. I mean the actual EA's stopped working. Trades stopped opening when they should have. Trades closed when they shouldn't have. Sometimes trades didn't close. That wasn't the worst of it. Sometimes I'd come home to find that metatrader was somehow shut down or that the EA was inactive as if somebody clicked on the button that makes the smiley face turn into a frowny face. Irony? When I tweaked the parameters to intentionally lose by either oversizing or other means, the same EA never had problems. So the EA works flawlessly when you lose but doesn't when you profit. What a coincidence! And yes I did intentionally throw some money "out the window" just to test that theory out. I'm convinced to this day (without really having smoking gun evidence) that my platform was remotely manipulted. I also thought if they could do that then they could surely affect the execution and slippage as well. Since around that time I never trusted MT4 for anything except for charting on larger time frames. I made the decision in my mind that I would never execute another trade on MT4 again. Never ever. This was before the existence of the Virtual Dealer Plugin was widely known. And even though I was discouraged by this, I knew that it was still profitable to make money in forex trading. But the answer is not in removing stop loss altogether. If anything, this helps the broker by giving them a free run at your whole account. Allow me to explain... I've said it many times here (some choose to disregard it) that realized and unrealized are the same. If you open a long at 1.3000 and an hour later price is at 1.2950, you've lost 50 pips whether the trade is open or not. The concept that by setting a stop means your broker is going to "hunt" your stop is not exactly true (*more on what I mean by not exactly true later). If that was the case then why not have another account with a different broker and play one broker versus the other by setting a stop on a smaller sized trade in opposite direction? Then as price moves towards the stop close both trades for an overall profit. Or pull the stop and add size to the negative trade, then set a smaller sized trade with stop loss in opposite direction on other broker. If they are hunting stops then you can play them back and forth like a yoyo, right? I've tried this. It doesn't give you an edge trust me. At least not with the brokers I've used and I've tried many. And even though the prices might be slightly off between two brokers, there can't be a big discrepancy. If there is because one broker is playing 'dirty games', then they risk losing more then there is to gain. Unless you trade with an unregulated broker on some castaway island, then you deserve to lose your money. *By 'not exactly true' I mean the broker could shade the price against you to trigger your stop at a worse price than it should have been if it were going to hit your stop anyway. This could also benefit the broker by triggering your stop when it might not have hit the stop because then price could move in your favor afterward. In other words the broker is shifting odds in their favor, but he cannot control the market ultimately. The broker cannot control price on a macro level but they can shift things on a micro level to their advantage. What I am trying to say to those of you that are cynical about setting stops is not that you are completely wrong. There is good reason to be cynical - remember they spend lots of money to be in business for profit and not lose to you. Go ahead and be cynical if your stop is a few pips away. Just don't be paranoid about a broker moving price 300 pips to go after you. If price is manipulated hundreds of pips to take out stops by whatever powers there might be, then you were on the wrong side of market efficiency anyway. Who's to say that "they" are not going to keep moving it hundreds of pips past where your stop would have been to go after others? Do you really think they will reverse it once they just get you? What sense does it make to hold something going hundreds of pips negative? Now I'm not saying there is a big bad wolf out there looking to get everyone, but if there is what difference does it make at the macro level? Ride with the wolf then (if there is one). But again it doesn't matter whether there is or isn't because patterns, supports, resistances and trends provide edges whether they are created by manipulation or not.

A large bank can't afford to take hits by shifts in the world market. They have exposures that are much different than little retail traders bob. Duh. Therefore they hedge. The hedging they do is not the kind of hedging you or I do. I also believe that the only time bluesteele got on your case about hedging is when you said you are hedging the same exact instrument. That I can tell you is just plain dumb. I've explained why here . Lastly, I don't think it's cool that you trash someone like you did here with bluesteele after you had him banned by your buddy. You make a statement about someone after they been taken away the opportunity to respond. Not cool. If you want people to treat you like the man you say you are, then you don't do things like that.

i'm with you on NO SL trading is dumb and dangerous. but in fact, i guess that maybe we neglect one important factor in trading. although NO SL results in less profit than SL in mathematical sense, but in "timing" sense, NO SL might be better than SL. but how? i guess it is the second chance??? say i have a 70% correct system, if the 1st entry is wrong, I hedged it with 2nd opposite position. using same 70% system, find another spot where one position is in profit, and the timing is good to entry. at that time, exit the profitable position and continue trading. or say, one trader can delay his loss by "fully hedge", or wait for a better opportunity/timing point to avoid the loss. am i wrong? this is the timing factor that hanover's explanation doesn't mention, if i remember. have you covered this in your posts? i didn't find similar discussion too.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
The way I am trading actually requires lots of patience. But Im still successful and my equity curve keeps going north. I have hedged some positions with success. I see hedging as a pretty sure way to increase/build my equity while holding on a losing position. If the 2nd trade i open in the opposite direction is not closing with tp, at least my 1st opened trade will not increase its loss. Eventually the 2nd trade will close with tp...and the 1st one as well (just a matter of patience and time).

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hanover already covered this. Basically what he and some of the old folks are saying is that you can exit (when you open a hedge leg) the trade and re-enter (when you close your hedged leg). What you do with a hedge can be replicated 100% and achieve the same result with the exception that you do not pay spread and rollover twice. The only benefit to hedging the way this thread is describing it is to satisfy your psychology. The feeling of "2nd chance". The "I must never lose" feeling. The feeling of "capture all the pips. leave no pip behind" While I admit that having this psychological fallback is very helpful and soothing to the mind, you can also reprogram the way you look at things to include stops; although i must say that it might be harder to do for some.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Yes, it can be replicated in theory but not in real life. If somebody would be able to replicate it in real life, he would be a multi-millionaire very soon. But all I read on all forums is: 95 % of all traders lose money. How come if setting a SL is so easy and recovering your lost money is even more easy because you only have to enter at the next good setup and win, win and win ? Where is the problem if it is so easy ? You know very well what the problem is: Psychology and market manipulation for example. To name a few. There have been very big brokers caught using software like the Virtual Dealer Desktop plugin. And I am telling you only one of the many options the plugin offers to the broker who is willing to steal money from stop-loss believers: Just read 99 % of all trading strategies which use SL. Now the multi-billion dollar question: Where do all Gurus or not Gurus recommend to place the SL ? Correct: Place your SL at the latest Swing High or Low. Or place it behind a strong S/R level. Or at ATR/x . It is the Bible, it is the dogma of all SL gurus and SL-churches. It is a breeze for a cheating broker to hunt stops from all the SL believers, even if the SL-believers use hidden stop loss EAs . Because everybody knows where the SL orders sit. And if you look at a chart : what happens in 99.99 % of all cases before a huge move happens ? Correct: price first moves in the opposite direction, shaking all the traders out who have set their SL at exactly the level where it belongs. When all those SL-believers have lost their trade, price suddenly shoots exactly in the direction they had their trade which just hit SL. But I know: You must place your SL. You must do it. Because if you don´t place it, the broker cannot hunt it. Understand ? Therefore you must place it. Under all circumstances please: Place your SL where all traders place it. Otherwise they cannot cheat on you. You understand ? Please, please place your SL and believe that it will be easy for you to enter at the next good setup and recover your money. Please, place your SL. If you do not, you are dumb and an idiot and you cannot trade and you have no brains and everybody will laugh at you and you are a fool. Read this thread and you will know about it. So, if you want to be a real trader, place your SL. Do it. Don´t think twice. Just place it there. Otherwise the broker cannot hunt it and cheat you out of your correct guess about the market. I hope that eveybody understands why it is so important to place a SL. I have explained it in detail now. And nobody should ever tell you to not doing it.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
So if I place my entry orders at the latest Swing High or Low or behind a strong S/R level I’ll win in 99.99 % of all cases. Is it your logic?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I just explained that you must place your SL behind S/R , not your entry. Maybe you misunderstood what I wrote ? Let us not disturb the game here. 95% of all traders lose in Forex. And they all lose because they place the SL according to the dogma about SL. Please don´t change this. You would fight the brokers and the 5 % who win in Forex. Again: Place your SL where everybody is telling you to place it. Otherwise you are dumb. You can read this in many postings in this thread from the best of the best traders who are missionaries of the SL cult.

The use of stops doesn't automatically mean setting them at levels which are likely to be tested. The inference here that all stop use is done this way and part of some 'dogma' is so out of touch with reality I can't even begin to imagine the events that lead up to some of the thoughts being presented here. If you can't separate the tool (stops) from a method (where/how to place them) then your ability to adapt and grow as a trader is being servery limited. ---------- After hearing traders base their assertions of the 'evil that is stops' on the anecdotal evidence of bad brokers and levels being hunted, I'm left thinking this entire thread needs to take a step back and talk about why we'd even take a trade in the first place. As you study the market in looking to develop an edge, price movements and patterns emerge as you slowly build up an inventory of information you can use to set entry, take profit, and protective action levels. All this would be based on what keeps your edge within a positive expectancy outcome over many trades. If your plan does not have a positive expectancy (stop or not) it is flawed from the start (forget about even talking about stops or hedges if you aren't already applying it to an edge in the markets.) Let's use the comment someone suggested earlier when speaking out against stops: Logical stop levels get run before price moves in the speculated direction. Setting a stop at a level that's likely to be tested doesn't seem like a very logical decision for a trader. If this was so common, wouldn't this be part of your plan? Wouldn't the "logical stop level" really be the "logical entry level" instead? ...wouldn't you at least notice the tendency and keep mind of it? If you're building out a trade plan, how does it even make sense to see a price history that suggests running such "logical" stop levels is a common thing yet still place your stops there if you KNOW it would result in the high likelihood of a negative outcome? Using this argument against stops entirely is completely ridiculous. The assertion makes sense if you want to advocate for not setting your stops at particular levels, but not against stops as a whole. ----------- Stops are just a tool. They aren't a trading method in themselves. A trader has to know how to use them, and where they are effective, in context to their trading plan/style/system/edge/etc.. If you're going to make an argument against them, do so in context to them as one of many tools a trader could employ... don't do so assuming one specific method that sounds quite logically flawed (for rational traders to use.)

Jack, the whole thread is nothing than beating a dead horse. Stop-hunting is only one aspect of it. Trading without a SL is very profitable. That is fact. And in this thread and others the dead horse is that the SL-believers will never accept that fact. I will watch how many more pages will be wasted beating the same dead horse by the SL-crowd.

hanover's elaboration is very sound in math sense. however, the "2nd chance" is not only a feeling, i'm afraid. hanover's assumption, which i've pondered for the passing weeks, is that when a trader decides to SL a pos, he is also sure this is a great entry for a new opposite position. or in other words, the trader SLs a pos based on his market reading/system signal, which is NOT the case in real life. or in another example, if the system is a 5ma x 10ma entry, then everytime 5ma cross up 10ma, you SL the shorts and go long; if 5ma x 10ma down, you SL the longs and go short. if this system is profitable, then use SL or NOT is same as hanover described. but in real life, or many other system doesn't work like that. 1. in real life, a trader might take SL only because the capital is being hurt. it is not a decision based on market reading. 2. to read the market and SL a pos may be easier or different than read the market and enter a pos. 3. how come "2nd chance" is a feeling only? i don't understand this point. let's say, a 60% win system (i'm on the stupid way maybe again ): SL way: 1st pos, u SL; 2nd pos, u win; ======&gt; breakeven hedge way: 1st pos, u hedge, now 2 pos (0 margin) with a float loss; wait , till you find another entry which you are 60% likely to win, you remove the winning pos of the 2 existing pos, now you have the 1st pos which is a losing pos, and it has 60% chance to go back to 0 loss. at this point, u can also add the 3rd pos that is same direction as the 1st one. for both 1st and 3rd pos, you have 60% to win. in the hedged case, u used 3 entries instead of 2 in SL case. the Expected Return is higher. isn't it better than SL way? i understand hanover's math, i think. i just feel it is not happening in real life. few traders can SL their losers and at the same time decide to enter the opposite positions, especially when their systems don't work that way. if I trade a break-out system, i SL a long pos because the breakout (up) is a failure, but maybe not because it is a breakout(down). In other words, i cannot just SL a long and enter a short, since my system doesn't work that way. In that sense, i need to wait, so why not hedge? I feel for the single factor of "time", hedge is quite meaningful in trading. I myself am a loser who stick SL in my trading, LOL.

No one is debating whether no-stop-loss can be profitable. It can. That is true. What is up in question is how profitable it can be compared to using a stop loss? In my opinion it is much less profitable over the long haul. If you know how to trade with a stop loss it is much more profitable. That is also a fact because you can compound your profits. And for you positive swap fanatics, using a stop loss is also more profitable than any no stop loss method that gains interest. When you open up trades without a stop loss, you have to enter small positions to be able to withstand huge drawdowns. The interest gained on tiny positions is also tiny. Daily interest payout is also small compared to the value of each pip. By opening these small carry positions with the mindset that you will never close out for a loss you are basically setting yourself up for a bad situation. By 'bad situation' I mean a large drawdown that could potentially take years to get your account back to breakeven. Assuming that swap rates and leverage remains unchanged, that's already a bad situation. Now imagine if interest rates drop! Or leverage changes! Now I know bob is going to come on here and say he trades without leverage, but then you might as well go put your money in bonds or cd's cause the return will be greater per dollar invested. In order for no leveraged positions to outperform a bond or cd requires monthly moves of 10,000+ pips each and every month. That doesn't happen. Now to answer the smarty pants that is going to come on here and say "well if you pyramid/stack the none-leveraged positions when positive"... That requires knowing when to enter and exit. If you know how to do that then why not trade straight up on a trade per trade basis with increased leverage and size??!! Stacking also increases the need for a stop otherwise the reversal of all those positions wipe out your profits faster than it took you to build them. Then you just wasted more time to make nothing. Even with interest on your side. Yea that sucks huh. So forgive me if I have beaten the dead horse that trading with a stop loss is more profitable than without, but the math is indisputable. So far you have continued to debate this without presenting any math. Just like you keep saying that hedging is beneficial (outside of the psychology of it) to trading after I presented mathmatical evidence that it is not due to swap differential where you could replicate the same results without hedging and save the money lost on swap. So far you have failed in presenting any mathemtahical evidence to support your claims. So I now challenge you to present mathematical evidence . Okay Mr. FXTR51. Now it's on you to explain it clearly and in a way that is not disputable. The ball is in your court. Yes I am calling you out. If trading without a stop or hedging is better then please, please, please show me using math how that is possible. I want you to present it clearly in a way where I'm wrong. If you can I will happily admit that I have wasted all my years of learning. And please don't come on here and say how the broker is chasing your stops. I have explained how unrealized and realized are the same. I've also explained that brokers moving price to "go after your stop" can be exploited to your advantage, so don't even go there. That kind of cynical response is amateur at best. I look forward to your reply.

I don´t know them and have not read a word they posted, but I know that trading without a SL is profitable.

Hedging again... I love this topic. "Hedging" does not help you, it only hurts you. You will make more money (or lose less) the moment you wean yourself off the "hedging" tit. This is a mathematical fact. The type of hedging that is done by professionals does not mean, has never meant, and will never mean "buying and selling the same thing at the same time and thinking that the two don't offset".

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I think you missed most of the debate in this thread. Didn´t you read how dumb traders are who don´t use a SL ? Page after page it goes. That is your point. Not the one debated by the SL-missionaries who use name-calling etc. That depends on the trader. Remember: 95 % lose, most of them are SL traders. I agree. It is evident, isn´t it ? I don´t trade without a SL, only when I use lock-unlock. That is another story because with that method I can start with more initial risk. Real life is different than your math which is indeed indisputable. Because most traders close winning trades too early and let losers run too far. If you would please include that into your indisputable math ? Not ? Well, I thought so. Nanningbob and others make more profits as others. That is fact. It is indisputable and it reflects real life. Compared to all those who use a SL, they are miles ahead. Do you agree ? But ... but .... but if those who lose would know how to trade better, then ... then ... .then they would be ahead. Correct. But we don´t live in "if" and "then", we live in the real world and not in a theory. And now you know why. It does not match reality. It depends on the trader. Not on the math. I did. You think that your math matches real life. But in this you are wrong. Completely wrong. Should be clear enough. If you don´t believe me, then please ask those in this forum why they constantly lose money using SL. And then ask those who use no SL and constantly win. That is real life. If you trade profitably, then you did not waste your years of learning. You are completely wrong on it. On your spreadsheet or in your math you can fantasize that they are the same, but in real life you are wrong. I once had bought stocks for 100k . Market dropped and on the paper I had lost 50k.( if I had sold it at that price) I waited until market went into my favor and sold for 200k. Now you come and you are trying to convince me that if I had sold at 50k it would have been the same as if I had sold at 200k. Please explain to me why winning 100k is the same for you as losing 50k. I am looking forward to your indisputable math about this. Maybe you can convince me that a realized loss is the same than a not-realized loss. But I doubt it.

The issue you are having here is an issue of an edge. You do not have a 60% profitable strategy. I do not wish to speculate on whether or not your strategy really produces 60% wins. But the truth is this: 1)If your strategy really produces 60% wins, you do not need to hedge at all. Just following your strategy repeatedly will already make you a winner. 2)The reason you are hedging is because you find that you are wrong more times than expected and worse of all, you don't understand why you are getting it wrong. Hence, you are resorting to a hedge to "wait and see" if things will get better. In the example you gave: This is the flaw in logic that I have been pointing out since the beginning of the thread. If you are 60% profitable, you don't need to hedge. You would be right in your trades more than half the time. What you are doing Charvo, is a psychological fallback. You are giving yourself the illusion of a 2nd chance. I know because I've been there and done that. It is not until you acknowledge that your edge is flawed to begin with that you can start to find better methods.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Let me explain the flaw in this this logic. 1)When you buy stock, you are not losing. You can hold a stock on forever and still come out positive because stocks pay dividends. This is an important distinction that is different from forex. It is for this reason that hedging could be viable. In forex, you cannot hold on to your position forever because rollover will eat your profits. 2)When you say that "I waited until market went into my favor and sold for 200k." you are doing so with the assumption that you would be right in your analysis and that you would surely be profitable. I find it funny how we sometimes ignore the other scenario where things don't go our way. This goes back to my original argument that if your edge was so solid to begin with, you would not need to hedge. You need to understand that there could be a chance that you can be wrong the 2nd time as well. If that happens, you could lose more than 50k. When that happens, what would you do? Hedge more? You are now eating more and more into your margin expecting a turnaround to happen (or waiting for your strategy to finally be correct) - all the time paying more and more for spread and rollover. I hate to bring references into a discussion because I feel it is unfair for the other debating party. It is sort of "you can't dispute that" argument. However I will say that all the successful traders IRL I have talked to employ a stop loss. Or at least know mentally where they will cut off their losses. This goes back all the way till the start of trading history. Until someone else can come up with a book that champions the cause of no SL trading, I'm afraid the burden of proof lies with you to prove it works.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
thelws, I have no idea why you and others are beating around the bush. I bought for 100k. Market dropped to 50k. I waited. Then I sold for 200k. Then you come and tell me that my logic is flawed and another guy is telling me that a realized loss is the same as a not realized loss. What is wrong with you ? It can happen in Forex too. What if I have positive swap ? In fact it happens every day and every day traders without a SL profit from it. Alfredo !!! TMA extreme thread !!! And many others too. Or not ? They are trading forex, not stocks. Everybody is only constructing examples to "prove" their point instead of accepting the obvious: A realized loss of 50k is not the same as a realized profit of 100k . Why is it so hard to accept this simple fact ? And why is my logic flawed ? Yours is certainly because you are telling me that a loss of 50k is the same as a profit of 100k. Please explain in an understandable way why a loss of 50k is the same for you than a profit of 100k. Until now nobody was able to convince me that it is the same, but maybe you have a superior knowledge of logic and math.

Please read this thread from start to finish. It is only about 10 pages long. Unlike our threads in 2012, back then only the really knowledgeable had anything to say about this topic. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=68598 Merlin is willing to give 100k to anyone who can prove that hedging cannot be replicated 100% using stop loss methods: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...52#post2678252 And to answer your swap question (because I have also done this before). You are fine when you are moving in 1 direction. The moment you hedge, the -ve swap of your hedge leg will overpower your +ve swap on your original leg. There is a reason for this and that is: brokers will not pay for your swaps. I have mentioned this before. You cannot hold a hedge out in forex till the end of time. You will lose money.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
with all due respect, and thanks for your input to solve my confusion actually, i've hedged, then determine "never hedge again", then got 2nd thought and confused again. (with many years passed). the question is that you did not present the mistake in my example or logic, or i fail to understand your reasoning. or i say, assuming that i have a 60% system, and i prefer to hedge the floating loser and wait for 2nd entry signal. why will that be worse than SL way? the expected return seems higher to me.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
What flaw in logic I am attempting to point out is that a trade can be replicated using a SL method instead of a hedge. The benefit is that you will not bleed from the extra spread and rollover. Hanover already posted the calculation with a diagram somewhere near the early discussion in this thread. He did post a lengthy description which I will attemp to simplify here. Do take note the example below is assuming that you have a 100% sure method that you will be correct in your trade. Hedge method 1.0000 - Buy ENTRY (pay 1st spread) Pay Rollover for 1 position 0.9000 - Ohnoes... price went wrong way 0.9000 - Hedge (by selling). (Pay 2nd spread) . Pay Rollover for 2 position. -100 pip floating loss 0.7000 - Price reversing. Oh yea. Close hedge leg. +200 pips. 1.1000 - Oh yea. My original position made 100 pips. Total pips made: +300 SL method 1.0000 - Buy ENTRY (pay 1st spread) Pay Rollover for 1 position 0.9000 - Ohnoes... price went wrong way 0.9000 - Close position. -100 pips 0.7000 - Price reversing. Oh yea. Open a new trade. 1.1000 - Oh yea. Made +400 pips Total pips made: +300 Now let's see what happens if we don't have a 100% surefire edge. This is a more realistic scenario. This is the other scenario where we might be wrong a few times in a row: Hedge method 1.0000 - Buy ENTRY (pay 1st spread) Pay Rollover for 1 position 0.9000 - Ohnoes... price went wrong way 0.9000 - Hedge (by selling). (Pay 2nd spread) . Pay Rollover for 2 position. -100 floating loss 0.7000 - Price reversing. Oh yea. Close hedge leg. +200 pips. (-300 floating loss) 0.6000 - Ohnoes, price didn't move back to my breakeven. Hedge again. (Pay 3rd spread. Pay rollover for 2 positions) -400 Floating loss Total pips made: -200 floating loss. SL method 1.0000 - Buy ENTRY (pay 1st spread) Pay Rollover for 1 position 0.9000 - Ohnoes... price went wrong way 0.9000 - Close position. -100 loss 0.7000 - Price reversing. Oh yea. Buy entry. (pay 2nd spread) Pay Rollover for 1 position 0.6000 - Ohnoes, price didn't move up. Cut loss. -100 loss Total pips made: -200 loss. Notice that in scenario 2, when things don't go your way, you still pay swap and spread. For every position you keep open, you pay and bleed. And what for? In the end the results of the 2 methods are the same. You can play around with the way you hedge. You can modify the strategy of hedging. But just remember that every time you open a hedge leg, you pay for spread and you pay for rollover.

lol, oh Bob you're just soooo lost! India's central bank was referring to corporates, not retail forex speculators! Companies who trade internationally (import/export) are exposed to transaction risk from (sometimes volatile) currency fluctuations, they're not speculators in FX! They hedge that risk to protect bottom line invoicing by using options, forwards, futures, money market borrowing, currency swaps, and a host of other instruments, their motives are completely different than FX traders! lol, tooo funny!

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Absolutely! lol, try telling Nanningbob that fact!

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Excellent posts, explanations, and examples....but I think you're probably banging your head against a brick wall! These guys don't want to know the logic or math, it's a psychological issue for them, they're unable to handle risk/loss is all so they dream up ways to convince themselves that what they're doing by nedging is perfectly logical. It seems they're much happier living/trading in denial rather than accepting the patently obvious!

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi George, What you have shown here is a very sound and solid way to trade. My only concern and if I may get your opinion on this is that when you use such a small sl (15-20pips) in higher tf such as 1hr it will get hit more often than not before it takes off for profit.. in other word the trade is spot on but not enough breathing room given to catch the bounty. I trade the same way but because of this issue I went down to lower tf (5m) to spot my entry more precise. I think I have seen you in my thread from time to time so you may relate to what I am talking about. I would like to hear about your experience and results trading this way in higher tf (1hr) in relation to sl hit in such small frame.. how often it gets hit.. would you reenter and how.. etc, ..Looking forward to your reply. Good trading to all. Dean

Yes, very probable Graham has 'n sell position open in 1.59 region for EurUsd and a buy position open at 1.20 region. What is wrong with a 3000 to 4000 pips floating profit, especially if you closed several 1000 to 2000 pips positions in between? Don't make much sense to me to come up with absolutes without taking a particular strategy, method etc into consideration. That is like ignoring the elephant in the room. If you are profitable, feel happy about your profits then what is the problem? I think it is a illusion to think about some maximized curve fitted profit hind sight function. What is an edge? Would participating, following the trend, determination, patience, money management, cutting losses, running winners qualify as edges? It does not seem philosophical very solid to me to make some mathematical / statistical absolute statement about positive mathematical expectation. It sounds nice in theory, but how does it work in reality? (I am thinking some clever Nobel price economist fund that went bust on these kind of ideas) How much data do you include / exclude? When will you know that your edge does not work anymore mathematically / statistically? What significance level do you pick? What if your strategy start to work again, just after you dump it because it does not work any more because of some or other arbitrary chosen significance level? However now you sit out, because there is a lag before enough data is gathered to confirm, that your strategy was still in fact working (though not statistically any more) etc. I am not saying statistics is completely useless, but that it also has some serious weakness like most things in life as we do not live in a perfect world.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Yes, excellent but not reflecting real life and thus besides the point altogether. So all what you are doing is banging your head against that brick wall inside your own head. Because it does not reflect real life. All of your perfect logic and math is only doing hindsight analysis: If the hedger is going short here, the SL guy will do this. If the hedger is going long, the SL guy will do that. And with that hindsight you can always prove that SL-trading is much more profitable because you can trade with a higher initial risk ( plus you don´t pay swap etc.) So yes, friends: with perfect hindsight you will always beat the hedger and the guy who does not use a SL. There is no doubt about it. But when will you stop beating that dead horse ? You whole math and logic does not match real life. In real life the trader will not do what you tell us he would do when you know where price went up or down on historical charts. Is it so hard to accept reality ? In real life the trader is placing his SL too near and will be stopped out. He is cutting a winning trade and he is letting run the losing trade. He is a prey for stop-hunting brokers and for traders who know how to trade against the herd of other traders. Maybe you should read "Trade the Trader" by Quint Tatro. The only reason why he is so successfull in his trading career is the herd of traders who use a SL and he knows where their SL sits and how to take the money from them. Although mathematically and logically the SL-user is ahead in theory, in real life he gets beaten by nanningbob and others who don´t use a SL. That is all there is to say about it, but all you are doing is beating a dead horse, so the psychological issue is yours but somehow you are not able to admit it. Conclusion: You can belong to the 5% who win by using SL and/or using no SL . All depends on the skills and personality of the trader.

Just want to say thanks to everyone who posts on this thread. FXTR51, fierceman, pipmutt, thelws, and all others. We may have our differences in philosophy, but we are all seeking to improve. I think now's a good time to step back and acknowledge that we have the same intentions which is to become better traders. So thank you all for sharing your thoughts, ideas and experiences.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I dont know why I am in this debate since i cant hedge but I love a good debate. The difference is this. Once a SL is taken it is permanent. The hedger always has the opportunity to decrease the difference. His hit may not be -100 but -50. In that way he beats out the SL guy by 50 pips, again assuming that both trades are closed at the same time is a fallacy. I do sympathize with the guy who said he tried hedging and now he had two trades to deal with instead of one. It is why I never really got into it as a trading method other than a time out, which as I said before I have only used a handful of time over the years, so not really part of the box of arrows. The second part of the argument also has a fallacy in that once you are done with the profit trade they dont immediately do the opposite trade. They look for the next best trade. So if they went a -100 SL and then did a +200 profit trade they would not be in the CT trade situation. They wont be taking the opposite trade, (I know they are not a CT trader because you made fun of them in the past). So the hedger will be increasing his profit and reducing his losses while they are still looking for another trade. During this process the hedger is gaining on his account while they are looking. That is how and why it does work. Their assumption in their problem that they are both opened and closed at the same time and the SL trader would make the same trade and reenter at the same time is a very false assumption that would never play out in real life. Again, I see no problem in taking a hedge and walking away from a screen and taking breather, plan a strategy and then get back into the battle. It is like a Baskeball game, you call timeout everything stops you plan a strategy and then get back out on the court. That is such a simple easily understood concept it amazes me that some are so stuck in the mud, they cant see the value of that. I can very easily. Anyway gotta go have fun writing about this post for the next 3 pages. Pipmutt get a life.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Well said while i would not recommend hedging forex with forex (except for automated mtf strategies which do multiples for the sake of simplicity instead of merging positions) this is probably the only but valid reason to hedge - take a timeout. While using a clearly defined SL is prefered in my opinion there are cases where you suddenly find yourself in a setup where that SL might not make sense anymore so paying an additional spread/comm might give you some time to reassess the situation and get a better exit on one of your positions to make up for the double spread/comm and get out at a better price the same time. However people... doing this successfully is even harder than being profitable in the first place since getting out cleverly of such situations is even harder than your average trade. So if you still have to decide - hedge or not - chances are you don't even have the fraction of the knowledge you should have to pull this through successfully.

If that's the case then he needs to review his analysis and adjust where he places his stop loss. I would have thought that was pretty obvious. On the contrary, he's protecting capital, minimising risk, exploiting profitable trades, and utilising leverage. If (you suspect) your brøker is spiking price to trigger your stops then you need to either find another brøker/market or take counter measures to compensate. Simply not having a stop is not a sensible solution, well not unless you intend to eventually give all your money away! Trading against the herd would be a bit like swimming against the tide. The herd don't drown because they're swimming in the wrong direction, they drown because they can't swim. I thought Tatro trades equities doesn't he?

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Everything is pretty obvious. And because it is, 95 % are losing and only 5 % win. Your perfect trader is a virtual thing, created to "prove" that you must use SL. And yes, you must , because otherwise brokers and smart traders cannot be profitable. In the real world, 95 % of your SL believers lose money while the NO SL people constantly win money. And on it goes ... and again .... running in a circle only.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
An easy claim to make but not so easy to substantiate with reason, logic, and math. Your argument simply doesn't hold water, neither reasonably, logically, nor mathematically, but I guess that's not going to stop you trying! Not to worry, you do your thing, others will do theirs, at the end of the day who really gives a crap as long as we're all happy!

--- 帖子 #574 ---
That sounds logical, doesn´t contradict math and reflects real life. We have solved the riddle.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hello, It sounds logical and reflects real life if you for one and some of your 10+v friends to grow some you know what to open a explorer account and trade it for minimum of 6months if not more for the world to see to reflect anywhere close to real life.. otherwise you just talking atta your you know what sport. You and most in here are just talking a good talk, that's all. I am not saying that one vs other (sl or no sl etc) is better or worse.. IMHO they both make money and lose money or create dangerous times to do crazy things out of your way, it all boils down to TRADERS execution at different difficult stages of either style. I think most will concur with me on this. so, you making a firm claim that one is better than other, well, show it.. ok man show it.. open a explorer account.. show everyone how you hold your ground when your -100 trend against perhaps and you hedge now or do recovery level one trade or lock and unlock etc, and so on deeper into losses. if now your replying back that: you don't have time or care or less to put the effort in!!.. ok, than stop preaching, lecturing and claiming shit.. I know its a forum but at some point things need to be settled like the old days, duel style, lol. listen friend, People want to see reality and not the constant lectures and arguments and empty claims. it don't matter you win or lose its about the process.. this way the level of learning and helping (in your case!, I guess) jumps to the moon. good trading to all.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
No, I never made a claim which one is better. Because it depends 100% on the trader. My only claim is: You can lose using a SL. You can lose using no SL. You can win using a SL. You can lose using a SL. This is my final verdict on this matter.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I thought the above were your words. bcz the way I understand it is that the 95% losers who believe in sl no matter if they are good traders bcz they believe in what they believe they are losers at the end and vise versa are not. isn't this pretty close to claiming that sl traders are ultimately the losers and no sl's are not. maybe i am missing something.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I suppose one can reason that majority of retail traders use stop losses, but according to some statistics 95% are not profitable. The implication is that those that do not use stop losses has then a higher success rate (even though there are also failures obviously). If however, the assumption that majority of retail traders use stop losses or only 5% is profitable is wrong, then the argument though is not valid any more. So I think that was more a relative than absolute statement, loaded with some sarcism in my reading.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
He is basically saying that the 95% losers of this market all or most of them are the sl believers and none of or less of no sl believers fall into the 95% overall market losers. If that's the case i like for him to put his mouth where his money is and show it or anyone else in that case.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
That is the fallacy of your argument once again. Here is the real fact, you cannot buy and sell IBM at the same time it is a zero sum, you can only do one or the other as separate transactions. You cant sell IBM if you dont have any. You cannot buy and sell eur/usd. You can buy eur and you can buy usd and you can buy both at the same time because they are two different instruments not unlike stocks etc. I have to buy IBM stock before I can sell it. However with eur/usd I can do both at the same time, I can buy euro and I can buy usd at the same time, that is a fact. So they are two separate transactions. So let us be factual when we debate OK??

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Problem as I see it, is that one do not have knowledge of what proportion of retail traders use stop losses. From a mathematical or statistical perspective it should be sufficient though to show only one extremely successful trader that do not use stop losses to disprove the hypothesis that using stop losses is a precondition for success. You only need one black swan to disprove that all swans are white. I don't believe he ever made the claim that only traders that don't use stop losses are profitable.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Don´t take one sentence out of context, P.Dean . A few postings back 2 successfull traders of this forum were mentioned who make profits without using a SL. I add nanningbob and Alorente (and myself and Favorite) because I know we all trade profitable without SL but we use different methods. We don´t need to prove it anymore.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
excellent example, as clear as Hanover's, now, let's look at the result: hedge: -200 floating loss (unrealised) vs SL: -200 loss at this point, this exact point. if the trader has an edge or a probability that is &gt; 50% to be right in his next decision, let's say 55% then the expected return of next decision: hedge: 200 * 55% + (-200) * 45% = 20 pips; vs SL: -200; i understand that at this point, i didn't do anything for SL scenario (should've entered another pos, maybe?). anyway, what's wrong of my reasoning above? thanks a lot for your help and explanation. i'm really confused and not sure about the topic, and that's why i decide to seek you guys' help to clarify my puzzle till the end of the world .

--- 帖子 #584 ---
charvo... you are ignoring the whole example and cherry picking bits and pieces you want in order to explain your point of view. I will copy and paste merlin's words exactly here. This link is his exact post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...46#post1838646 You have NO expected return. You are actually out of the market when you hedge. The example that I gave is as clear as I can make it. I showed you why the no hedging method produces exactly the same result as a hedged method (minus extra costs)

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Is that the best you got that the two you mentioned are successful!! who said so.. how do we know.. only a fool will make such statement without backing it up with a prof excuse me for saying. you say, "We don´t need to prove it anymore".. when and where was it that you did prove it in the first place!!.. Listen, at this time and stage of trading world and this forum with their new products and increased knowledge of retail traders, until one does not back what he preaches with a live explorer account and trade it live for over 6 months to a year nothing is for certain and its all just empty talk, do you see the logic in this my friend, this is what i am trying to tell you. I for one highly doubt that either four of you are profitable.. you guys disagree, ok, my apology in advance, but.. prove it. You all say you don't have to prove anything, don't have the time, don't care etc, ok fine, but don't preach and lecture either or even open a thread, or say your profitable or so and so are profitable, bcz simply its not sufficient. Talking a good game and playing a good game are two different things and that is why they play the game. What's laid out, needs to put in action to see if it works in the heart of reality in the eyes of everyone otherwise is as good as useless. I personally highly command that FF should not allow any trader to open a thread without a explorer account to go with it. I hope they will see this post and think of it highly. This is where all members will for sure get served the real benefit.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
got it so clearly now. Merlin's words indeed convincing! i'm not a math person really. thanks for the patience.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Am not impressed with this strategy. It is directly opposite what i learn here in FF and what i believe from my learnings. I learned to build + floating profit. But your strategy will always have negative floating profit. I learned to build positive legs. But your strategy make me to build negative legs. At some point are latter you will have lot of negative legs smiling at you. If you go back the chart and test it, you will find lot of price which is never retested. IMO its a bad strategy. Sorry if i hurt you. But it is just to say what i feel about this strategy. Cheers buddy

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I agree. (Have you noticed that I never started a trading system thread ? And I probably never will. There are enough of them in this forum already)

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Bob what are you on about now? In the spot forex market, and in the example you've given of Eur/Usd you're buying one currency and selling the other, or if it's simpler for you to understand you're paying for your Eur with Usd. Sure you can buy both Eur and Usd but you still need to pay for them with something ! Whatever you pay with you're in effect betting that the value of your purchase, in this case Eur, will increase against the currency you paid with. As regards selling IBM shares which you don't own, I'm not sure if naked short selling is still allowed in some countries or whether there are restrictions so I can't answer your question, however I'm sure there are other options for someone wishing to bet against IBM's share price.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
I'm sorry, but there is not a single fact that you got correct there. I thought we already had a discussion about this in another thread...

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I got it right. When you buy eur on eur/usd you are buying eur. When you sell eur/usd you are buying usd. That is correct.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Yes, that is correct. However, if you use EUR to buy USD, and then use USD to buy EUR, you have no market exposure - your account equity doesn't change regardless of where price moves (except your account is actually leaking due to overnight interest). For all intents and purposes, you are out of the market, and are donating the difference in overnight interest, and an extra spread payment to your broker . The argument between "hedging" or using an SL is actually absurd, because it amounts to the same thing. When you "hedge", you are in fact exiting your position just like you are with an SL. The only difference is that it costs more to "hedge".

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I dont think your really know what I believe or do. As I have explained in the past hedging has very limited uses. I liked it as a time out. The last time I used it years ago. I hedged a profitable trade because my wife wanted to go out for dinner. I came back 3 hours later and found out I had kept my profit and price had reversed. I originally thought it would run but I didnt want to take the chance of losing the position I thought was very good at the time. In that case I saved myself a winning trade. The cost of interest is negligible and really irrelevant. People hedge, hedge is used to control losses, whether you use another currency to hedge, another stock, or bond or whatever............. the principle is still the same, it is meant to prevent large losses which a hedge in forex does. No matter what you use as your hedge instrument, no matter what market you use it in, you always have the same problem no matter what field of investments. That is if you hedge, finding a way of undoing the hedge in a way that makes the transaction profitable is the problem every hedge trader faces in every investment field. To me it is that simple. You see no value in it, great. Some people find an occasional use for it, I average 1 time every 2 years in my usage. Big deal. You want to get all worked up about that be my guest. Some think they can trade that way but they realize they must close the two positions at different times to make it work. Ok I got that, not my cup of tea though. So why keep beating this like the world depends on it. I can understand the concepts, it amazes me some people are stuck in the mud on this. Why do you even bother? As I have stated before my position on SL is around 1% with an occasional exception if I understand the fundamentals of a currency. However, I trade small positions, low leverage, so I can have a wide margin or field to trade in. I allow trades to become winners. Why? Because most of the time they will. My analysis is pretty good. I am a very strong believer in ranging in Forex. What goes up must come down and what goes down must come up. That is the only truth about Forex I have found to be 100% true all the time. So I trade that truth and the whole philosophy of my trading is based on that truth. It works whether you like it or believe, I dont give a rat's as.....................

Whether it is negligible or not depends. In any case, I don't see why someone would want to incur even a negligible cost in return for absolutely nothing. No. This type of hedging only controls your losses insofar as it eliminates (or reduces) your net exposure, which can always be done in a simpler, cleaner and cheaper way, by closing or reducing your position. Real hedging, on the other hand, is used to optimize a portfolio by leveraging the correlation between different markets. There is no value in it, and I'm pretty sure you're smart enough to see that by now. It is difficult to judge someone's tone at internet forums. I assure you, I am not getting worked up about it at all. I am trying to educate people about what, to me, seems like a perfectly simple and logical idea regarding a self-destructive practice which is deceptively called "hedging". I guess I could just give up, but I am a persistent mofo. I think that this topic, while not terribly important in itself, is a window into how irrational thinking really can creep into people's trading, and how little some people understand about the market that they are doing business in.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Well, anyway good luck, I do enjoy friendly debates. If people want to deal with two trades instead of one, be my guest. I think at this point I have tried everything there is to try in the market and I have my preferences. It is true that the more skilled I get the less I have to use certain questionable techniques in trading. Some things I like to do, like multiple levels and entering the market in parts instead of all in all out positioning. I understand I am not always going to get in the market right the first or even the second time even though my overall analysis is sound. I startd almost 6 years ago when a trader taught me to trade the 15M chart. Got tired of getting my head bashed in and whip-lashed. Then it was the 1H, then the 4H, then the daily, now the weekly trend, with daily strength entering off of the 4H chart pivot/S/R levels. I am comfortable with the concept of top down analysis and giving trades a wide berth. I find it consistently profitable. The bottom line is what we all want to do, just be consistently profitable. Some will do better than others. Anyway good luck to you, I really dont disagree that much with you on the issue of hedging other than the concept that on occasion I can see a purpose for it rather than your position of never a purpose. Fair enough I can accept that. So on to the next concept. What is really good about these debates is not so much for you and I but other traders can see the different concepts and come to their own conclusions. In that way you and I have both served a purpose to the FF community.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
I'm going to try and stay away from talking about hedging or no stop loss for some time. It becomes repetitive nonsense after awhile. If someone wants to hedge to give themselves a false sense of security even at a greater cost then that's their choice. Sometimes devices help people cope with the situation from a mental aspect. Fortunately, hedging is a crutch I don't need nor have the temptation of falling victom to. If someone believes that swap payout to broker is negligible, then that's their opinion really. I prefer to keep that money since I feel paying it does not provide me with an advantage and hedging actually increases the length of time to achieve my goals on profit. Lastly, anyone who uses a broker that does not allow hedging on the same account has now consumed double the amount of margin neccessary to have a net flat position.

It's amazing the amount of people who simply can't seem to understand that very basic principle! What you'll find with Bob though is that when someone points out he's totally wrong about something, rather than admit he's wrong he'll either ignore it and bury his head in the sand, try to squeeze the toothpaste back in the tube, or come out with some obvious remark like " I got it right. When you buy eur on eur/usd you are buying eur. When you sell eur/usd you are buying usd. That is correct. ". It's quite funny to watch.....

I personally highly command that FF should not allow any trader to open a thread without a explorer account to go with it. I hope they will see this post and think of it highly. This is where all members will for sure get served the real benefit.[/quote] PDean, Now that is a very good idea. Works both ways as well, OP sets up an account to prove/ dissprove the method, but thoses members that know that the idea is flawed will also have to link in their account to provide reasonable reasons with evidence as to why its BS, rather than the usual shooting from the hip. Somehow I can't see that becoming the norm on here,. M.

lol, easy to say but not so easy to substantiate, eh Bob. I point out your nonsense and correct it. You, not so much....you already ran away from Bluesteele when you couldn't reply to his challenges, is there a trend forming? By the way how's your ' whip-lash ', not to mention your " What goes up must come down and what goes down must come up ." theory? Bob, no offence but for your supposed 6 years in the business you don't seem to have progressed very far! -

To me it is simple. Some people can think outside the box and be 3 dimensional thinkers, others can not. When a two dimensional person thinks they have you, you just smile knowing what you do works whether they believe it or not or conceptualize it or not is not my problem. I think PipMutt is kind of a funny guy. He doesnt even realize the trap he has put himself into, I like watching him hang himself with his own rope. So it is easy to stay cool that way. I mean if you really had listen to what I was saying or what I have written and taught in my threads compared what they try to picture me as you know they are two different things. The fact that I have said I have SL points and take losing trades have never phased them into basically outright lying about my positions so they think they can win an argument. The bottom line is since the very beginning of the other SL thread with some exceptions of course, they act like middle school students horsing around in Art or Music class. I have seen the behavior for decades so it doesnt phase me at all. It is just I do expect adults to act accordingly and some here dont. I do have one thing to say though, in all my years of life, this is the first place I have been shown such contempt and disrespect. Kind of a new experience for me. So it helps me to understand what it is like. Anyway, the Pipmutts, BlueSteeles, and NubCakes are the real losers here. Everyone else gets to learn something and impart knowledge. 2+2 is a very respectable trader and worth listening too, so is Hanover and some of the others. There is nothing wrong with their ideas or thoughts and probably a lot of traders have learned alot from what they have said, but obviously in some areas I disagree with them. But I dont have to blast them and call them names to debate. Pipmutt he is something else, just give him some rope and watch him hang himself. Amusing.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Thoroughly, otherwise I wouldn't participate! I especially enjoy pointing out when Bob makes some inane comment or blatant error and watching his reaction, like I said in a previous post, rather than admit he's wrong he'll either ignore it and bury his head in the sand, try to squeeze the toothpaste back in the tube, or come out with some obvious remark like " I got it right. When you buy eur on eur/usd you are buying eur. When you sell eur/usd you are buying usd. That is correct." . It's quite funny to watch..... Ah ya gotta luv FF!

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Do you realize you are the only one challenging that statement and you are dead wrong. Do you realize that???? That is the rope you are hanging yourself with. Do you know that the statement is 100% correct? Sheesh guy, are you really that dumb??

--- 帖子 #609 ---
lol, I'm not challenging the statement, just what it was in reply to! You totally sidestepped the subject and came out with a really obvious statement. See that's why I said "rather than admit he's wrong he'll........come out with some obvious remark" lol, you still don't get it do you! Bob I've lost track of the number of times I and others have had to correct your errors, you just seem so lost!

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I love it. Go ahead cut and paste another statement, ohhhhhhh you like being a slippery eel. Try to prove what I said was wrong and please please go back to my statement about the bank of India. I would love to see you make a fool of yourself about that one too. This is fun, he really thinks he slipped out of that one too.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Which one of your posts would you like to discuss Bob, this one....... .....or this one...... I replied to both, which you couldn't respond to and is when you started blowing smoke with your totally unrelated (not to mention patently obvious!) statement: ' When you buy eur on eur/usd you are buying eur. When you sell eur/usd you are buying usd. ' Now, if you really think you're able to hold a sensible conversation about either/both subjects then reply to my replies to your two posts, they're only a couple of pages back. What's your excuse going to be this time Bob, or are you going to come out with yet another unrelated obvious statement so you can say ' I'm right, I'm right' about something? Or perhaps you'll run away again like you did from Bluesteele?

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Thank you for sticking your head in the noose. I will get back to this. I ran from BlueSteele, are you a joke, serious. I challenged his manhood and called him a coward because he could not post how to use a SL. He disappeared for 3 days hoping the challenge would go away. The challenge still stands BlueSteele. You are a coward and nothing but a head basher. He has never contributed a single idea that would make a person a better trader. I have said this before and I am not afraid to say it again. There is nothing he has ever posted that would help anyone. It is why he got banned. You come from the same camp. You have nothing to say that makes people better traders. You only laugh mock and make contempt thinking that is some kind of intelligence. Anyway hanging you is going to be fun.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Well please don't let me delay you, when is this public execution going to start? You expended all that energy posting insults at Bluesteele (cheap shots as you know he can't reply on this thread) but failed, as usual, to reply to my post. Carry on, I'm ready whenever you are.......assuming of course that you don't try to get me banned from the thread like you did Bluesteele! Is that what you're waiting for? Don't worry, I'll always find somewhere to reply to your posts, Bluesteele did but I see you avoided responding!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I posted these when he was here he disappeared and came back 3 days later just like I knew he would. I called him a coward when he was here an and nothing has changed. He got banned because he cant post anything that is beneficial in trading.

Shorting in stocks and sell the eur/usd are not the same thing. That is one error for you. When I buy euro I actually get euro when I sell euro I get usd. That is not the same as shorting totally different ball game you dont take possession of the stock until you close the deal but then the stock is sold and so possession sometimes is never really had. Noose #1 around your neck. Short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller doesn't own. More specifically, a short sale is the sale of a security that isn't owned by the seller, but that is promised to be delivered. That may sound confusing, but it's actually a simple concept. (To learn more, read Benefit From Borrowed Securities .) Still with us? Here's the skinny: when you short sell a stock, your broker will lend it to you. The stock will come from the brokerage's own inventory, from another one of the firm's customers, or from another brokerage firm. The shares are sold and the proceeds are credited to your account. Sooner or later, you must "close" the short by buying back the same number of shares (called covering ) and returning them to your broker. If the price drops, you can buy back the stock at the lower price and make a profit on the difference. If the price of the stock rises, you have to buy it back at the higher price, and you lose money. Read more: http://www.investopedia.com/universi...#ixzz1uP33vgM4

#2 Statements have been made over the uselessness of hedging. Your opinion of it is worthless because if traders use it then it has worth. Examples For example: No real trader would ever do that. (guess what banks are the biggest traders on the market and they will hedge) That is 2 nooses around your neck. Brokers hedge their positions when there are more buyers than sellers or visa versa They do this to protect their accounts. #3 noose around your neck. All I have to do is show one time that there is a purpose in a hedge that is valid and that defeats your arguement that hedging is useless. The Bank of India clearly showed a valid use for hedging so you were defeated again. That is noose #4. Corporations will hedge to protect their equity. That is why it is called hedging and why hedging term is used. It is hedging. No getting around that. Noose #5 The fallacy of the anti-hedging argument is they assume the hedge buy/sell are undone at the same time. That is a brainless argument. The success of hedging is done when both can go into profit. A good CT trader knows how to do that. You dont, in fact cant even comprehend that. Noose #6 I could go on but that is enough hangings for now.

We need more discussion using the top half of the pyramid. Less of the bottom half. I reckon this chart needs to be stickied somewhere lol http://postimage.org/image/oeqzuph23/ http://s17.postimage.org/oeqzuph23/3...nt_pyramid.jpg Stating your experience is no better than ad hominem. True substance can offer refutation People don't produce maths arguments for fun. It is so that we know whatever we say can actually be backed up with some kind of evidence. And just to be clear... tribal knowledge, unsubstantiated claims or personal experience is really not good example of evidence. Unfortunately what I notice is that the no SL camp constantly provides a discussion up to "contradiction". There is very few counterargument or refutation from your camp. Most of the time your arguments end up something like "I do it and it works for me... but I can't explain why it works".

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Fare reply NNbob. Good to know. Anyway. I know of a few professional swing traders that always trade without a SL, they use mental SL. They do that to avoid SL hunting. I know this is a weak argument but what I am trying to say is, I am testifying that there are people in the market making a lot of money consistently for many years and not using SL.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
lol, you're the one who started talking about IBM, not me...... Sorry what has any of that copy and paste from investopedia got to do with nedging? And this bit, " you dont take possession of the stock until you close the deal but then the stock is sold and so possession sometimes is never really had." . LOL, you seem to be tying yourself up in knots rather than tying a noose around my neck! Really, is that all you're bringing to this public hanging, come on Bob surely you can do better! Oh no wait, there's more!....... There's absolutely nothing wrong with hedging risk and exposure, it makes perfect sense and is nothing new, but that's not what nedging is so your examples and attempts at some sort of justification for it are meaningless, irrelevant, and ineffective. It's been explained to you and others numerous times but you still fail to grasp the simple concept that if, with the same currency, you buy something and sell an equal quantity of the same thing then in effect you have.....nothing! Bob you disappoint me although I must admit I'm not altogether surprised. You've again managed to totally avoid the subject and instead introduce unrelated subjects, which you've then gone on to copy, paste, and plagiarize! As hangings go it's a bit of a non starter this one I'm afraid Bob, the rope snapped and the trap door got stuck!

--- 帖子 #621 ---
, and a great pyramid!

--- 帖子 #622 ---
My position has been and has been for years is I use a percentage instead of a fixed number. It works very well. People who use mental losses usually are scalpers and are right there at the screen or low leverage traders who play wide berths like I do. If the computer programs cant SL you out or margin you out you have leveled the playing field with them and they cant hurt you. News spikes cant hurt your either or other anomalies. There are a lot of benefits to it unless you are a high leverage and/or large lot size to account size trader then you have no choice but use a SL. So it really comes down to what kind of trader you are. The guys who trade the fundamentals with large sums dont use SL either. They know what turns the markets long term so they will ride a trade for months on end until that base fundamental changes. No need for SL they know where price is going long term.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
It's been explained to you and others numerous times but you still fail to grasp the simple concept that if, with the same currency, you buy something and sell an equal quantity of the same thing then in effect you have.....nothing! [/quote] This seems to contradict what was indicated previously. One of the points made was that swap is paid. How do you pay swap on nothing? You have two positions that could be closed at different times. Once you close one position, how do you have nothing?

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Well BueSteele made a Jackass of himself in my thread so I banned him. I will do it to Pipmutt too. Too bad I know I cant trust those guys to act like civilized human beings. Bottom line you either act like an adult or get cut off. Hedging dont do it but all you have to do is show one time it has value and it is worth while. It would not exist nor be used by banks, companies and brokers if it didnt have some kind of value. So that ends the discussion right there. I have proven beyond any shadow of doubt it has a viable use in certain conditions. That is all I had to do. Pippy enjoy your rope, maybe you can chew on it for a while and cut yourself down from the tree.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
lol ok then, less than nothing! A liability without an asset. Exactly, once you close one side of the nedge you then have exposure, up until then you are effectively flat!

--- 帖子 #626 ---
If you had two positions, close one position, how is this less than nothing?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Your thread? Why on earth would I want to post in your thread? Hedging yes, nedging no. You're nedging, not hedging.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
This seems to contradict what was indicated previously. One of the points made was that swap is paid. How do you pay swap on nothing? You have two positions that could be closed at different times. Once you close one position, how do you have nothing?[/quote] No........ wrong, you do have something, you have 1 sell trade and 1 buy trade. The success or failure of the two trades will depend on when and where you close them. What fails to dawn on this stupid argument and I have pointed this over and over again. When you close the trades is the over all value of the trades determined. If trade buy is closed at +50 pips and price reverses and you close Sell at +25 pips it is not a nothing. It is +75 pips in the bank. That is the fallacy of your argument, you falsely think and assume the trades will never be broken at some point. This false assumption leads to wrong conclusions. Both sides of the hedge can be made profitable and this is especially true in a ranging market. I am sure someone out there probably trades like that but I dont know.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
As I already posted, only once you close one side of the nedge do you then have exposure, up until then you are effectively flat. Less than nothing referred to interest on a nedge. Anyway this has been discussed a million times before in this and other threads, but the logic and basic math seem too difficult for some people to understand!

--- 帖子 #630 ---
It's not until one side of the nedge is closed that you have exposure. No exposure, no profit/loss (apart from interest), so what's the point of doing it? This has already been explained to you numerous times, with examples, diagrams, pictures, graphs, charts....but still you don't get it! Never mind Bob, as long as you're happy.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Yes, difficult to understand the logic. So you open your one position with stop loss, you go in drawdown lets say -50 pips for argument sake with 100 pip stop loss. You have less than nothing, because you have a negative position and pay swap in the mean time based on your kind of reasoning. From my perspective you do not have nothing. Who is to say you did not close both positions at a profit at some time or for that matter one in a loss, but the other at a profit than more than compensate for the loss?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
It's not until one side of the nedge is closed/reduced that you have exposure. No exposure, no profit/loss (apart from interest), so what's the point of doing it? This has already been explained numerous times, with examples, diagrams, pictures, graphs, charts....it's probably all in this thread somewhere, just seek and ye shall find!

--- 帖子 #633 ---
You will have to consider context to come up with reasons. Does not make sense to hammer on an issue in isolation. Some things that do not make sense in isolation, makes plenty of sense once seen in context. How can one component of a strategy take on more importance than the whole strategy? It is kind of seeing the tree and ignoring the forest. Graeme's building an equity millipede is one example, that I already mentioned.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Some things yes, just not this thing. It's extremely clear, unambiguous, and easily demonstrated. Sorry there's simply no way to escape it, net long, net short, or flat. Because if one significant component is flawed it undermines the whole.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Yes, if you take a static view i.e. at one point in time. A dynamic view, a whole different ball game. Point is, we live in a dynamic world, not a static one. Show me the flaw in having locked in 2900 pips profit by being short on EurUsd at 1.59 and long at 1.20.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
lol, a nice bit of smoke but unfortunately it doesn't change fact. Dynamic, static, context, isolation.....you're still left with the same net long, net short, or flat, you simple can't escape that fact. It would be hard to say without having more details.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Let me put a twist in your thinking by asking you this question: If you can show me the benefit of locking in -2900 pips of floating loss by being long on EurUsd at 1.59 and short at 1.20, I will show you the benefit of locking in 2900 pips by being short on EurUsd at 1.59 and long at 1.20. If you still don't catch my drift... the benefit of both would be the same. And for the most part it will be a psychological benefit. But if it is about monetary terms, then there is no benefit.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I fail to comprehend what value your point has. It states the obvious, which means absolute nothing if context is not considered. I mean is profits / losses not made precisely due to the dynamic nature of fluctuating between these various states? Precisely why I say ignore context at your own peril. As they say, the devil is in the details

--- 帖子 #639 ---
It may well be stating the obvious but it seems the obvious isn't so obvious to some people! Net short/long is a fact, regardless of context. You can create as many scenarios as you want but it's not going to change anything. Various states, you mean price moving? Sure, but to profit (or lose) you need to be net long or short. If you know another way then please share it! Yeah you're kind of getting a bit mixed up there, I stated a very simple fact which doesn't require any further details, it's obvious in isolation, context will not change anything. Your example however does require more details before anyone can offer an opinion as to whether it's flawed or not.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
So are you really saying time has absolutely nothing to do with it? Is that why you simply ignore the second part of my question? This seems to be a contradiction. I gave you an example of a hedged position. Context won't change anything according to you as you are net short, long or flat, then why the need for additional information?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Sorry, I only picked up now that you did reply to my second question. As far as I know to close a position you could become flat in the sense of not having any position at all and therefore you are not necessary net long or short.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
lol, it seems now you're just arguing for the sake of it. Honestly, if you can't understand the basic premise that in order to profit (or lose) you simply need to have a net position either long or short, it's an unavoidable fact! Ok good, and would you be able to profit from not being net long or short? If so, how?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Personally, I cut my losses short and let my winners run so I am not really interested in a -2900 pip situation. You will have to expand what you mean by monetary benefit. I think you are referring to a relative concept. I am not that interested in some or other mathematical hindsight optimal profit function. Being reasonable profitable over long term is all that concern me.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
[quote=pipmutt;5651272]lol, it seems now you're just arguing for the sake of it. Honestly, if you can't understand the basic premise that in order to profit (or lose) you simply need to have a net position either long or short, it's an unavoidable fact! lol, Buy EurUsd at 1.30 and close it at 1.31. That is 100 pips of profit and I am flat, having no position at all.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Sorry it seems like so long ago, what was the question again? Oh yeah, flawed, dunno still couldn't say....more details!!

--- 帖子 #646 ---
[quote=pa_pips;5651308][quote=pipmutt;5651272]lol, it seems now you're just arguing for the sake of it. Honestly, if you can't understand the basic premise that in order to profit (or lose) you simply need to have a net position either long or short, it's an unavoidable fact! Hmm, ok I see we approached it from two different perspectives. I see what you intended to convey is that the pre-condition to a profit was to have been net long or short. On the other hand my angle was that a profit is not a profit until closed as a profit (realized profit).

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Is there any other way? No matter how anyone slices and dices it, at the end of the day the trader needs to make a decision about direction, it's unavoidable, even for nedging there has to be a decision to close one side and let the other side run, thereby having a directional bias, potential for reward, and of course exposure to risk. Uh-oh, does this mean that you also believe an unrealised loss isn't really a loss until closed as a loss? Look up mark to market and the recent financial crisis to see the pros and cons of such accounting methods, it's hiding losses or simply self-deception! Deja vu.......

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Yea, this answers my question. My personal conclusion is that to make a blanket statement that one cannot be profitable in the long run incorporating hedging into your strategy is nonsense. Yes, you can probably have some pissing competition about some optimised concept of profitability, but that is all relative as profitability between traders differ based on 101 factors.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
No, I did not imply that, the principal of prudence comes to mind here. You know what they say about asumptions...

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Did someone say you can't be profitable in the long run if you incorporate nedging into your strategy? I must have missed that bit.....I think what most knowledgeable traders are saying is that it makes absolutely no sense to have long and short positions of the same size on the same pair because in effect it means you're flat. If you're going to be flat then be flat, why tie up margin and why pay interest on a tactic which offers absolutely no benefits? People who use nedging may well be profitable in the long run, if they are then it's despite nedging not because of it. No not really. That they're good for the soul? I wasn't implying that you implied it, it was a question hence the question mark, nevertheless if it was an assumption I think it was a reasonable one to make bearing in mind you haven't been exactly forthcoming with specific information in your examples. There, now that's what I call hedging, lol

--- 帖子 #651 ---
I see the benefit in having both shorts and longs of equal size on the same pair. Just, because I am flat today why do I need to be flat tomorrow or a week from now?

People see leprechauns too. If you want to be flat, then don't have two offsetting trades on - just be flat. Tomorrow or next week, whenever you want to take a chance, then open a position. It's really that simple. You can be profitable when "hedging", you'll just be less profitable. You can also lose money not "hedging", you'll just lose less. This is mathematical fact. Why is it so hard for people to see this?

Less profitable, losing more - Could be, but also maybe not Hmm, that mathematical proven stuff is thrown a lot but never shown. How can you show it if you don't even know the strategy? I would say trading is synergistic where 1 + 1 = 3 and 1 is not 3. Profitability is the result of the cumulative effect of various factors. Do you use some or other crystal ball to read the future? Do you consider all the other multiple factors that make up profitability? I would state probably the only way to test this theory is to trade 2 accounts at the same time, where for 1 account hedging is not used. (Mentioned various times that showing stuff in hindsight is proof of nothing) I wish you luck, because I don't know how that will be possible. I am interested in 500, 1 000 and 10 000 pip movements in multiple currencies in both directions not 20 or 50 pips. Swaps is mostly a constant whereas legs on a millipede grow exponentially. Furthermore for what period do you do you test it, if you even can (another arbitrary factor)? And how about multiple various other strategies that other people may use? You can sit in a prison cell, have a Phd in knowing every little fine detail about 1 inch of that prision cell. The fact is you are still in a prison cell, because you cannot see the bigger picture.

Oh yea. Open a new trade. 1.1000 - Oh yea. Made +400 pips Total pips made: +300 The more "hedged" pairs you have, the more you will pay for rollover and spread. You mentioned millipede. I suppose you are talking about the building equity millipede thread. The truth is, if you follow that strategy, you will pay a lot for rollover (I have 1st hand experience trading that way so I can tell you it can hurt). You can ultimately achieve the same result by being net long or net short. But as that strategy is complex, you can justify hedging in the name of keeping your sanity and not having to keep track of your 20 or so open positions. (If you really trade using the milipede strategy u are never hedged. You are almost always net 1 direction.) But the truth still remains, every time you hedge, you bleed money for having no impact in the market. When price moves up or down, you don't make or lose money. Why pay money to have no position?

When Compliance Rule 2-43(b) was introduced a few years back brokers were using 'hedging' a selling gimmick ("you can still hedge with us!") and I wondered then just how many people actually fall for it.

And we wonder why the failure stats are so high.....

Huh, how would you pay more spread if you do not close positions willy nully on each stop loss that is triggered. It seems rather the opposite should apply.

Probably because it always is when you have two opposing trades of equal size on the same pair! lol, as I typed that I find it incredible that some people can't see the futility of having 'two opposing trades of equal size on the same pair'.....sounds even dumber when you type it out! lol, maybe it could be a new sales gimmick, ' we don't trade against our clients, with us you can be your own counterparty '!

Agreed, sorry should have made it clearer that I was more responding to positive swaps to a large degree could set off negative swaps in building an equity millipede in general (not just referring to hedging), because as thews mentioned correctly one is seldom net flat on this type of strategy.

Wow... i think you did not even read a single thing i wrote. And I said this before and will say it again... when you are 1 direction, swaps can sometimes be positive. The moment you hedge the pair, the -ve swap will overpower your positive swap. Brokers are not going to pay swaps for you! Therefore, it is never in us as retailers to ever hedge. The only reason I can accpet for hedging is the one I proposed. When you have to manage 20 open positions, it is ok to justify paying for a hedge so that you can keep your mind sane. A hedge... is paying money to the broker for having no position in the market.

No .............. swaps are what you pay to the broker every time you trade unless it is a positive swap. If you have 2 positions you still pay the swap, if you have 3 positions you pay the swap, it is part of doing business. It is a meaningless argument because you pay the swap whether you have 1, 2, 3 or more trades going. This is what I call a penny wise pound foolish argument. It goes like this: I made a business deal and I spent 10 dollars to make a 100. 10% went to costs. Then I show you a business deal where you make 1000 dollars but you spend 500 dollars on costs. Your argument is: that is 50% of my costs so it is a rotten deal. What you fail to see is the second deal makes more money even though the costs are higher. The cost of doing business is just that. The real bottom line is did you make money. That is the only issue that is relevant to any argument. Swaps is a meaningless side issue. You pay the swap when you trade so it is silly to argue that point. I want my broker to make money. He will stay in business and we will both benefit.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
I agree there are broker moles. You can spot them because they cant give any trading advice and risk their employer to a lawsuit. So they mainly troll and blast people and practice headbashing. You will notice that BlueSteele will never answer a trading question. He will run and hide every time. I have seen TH answer trading questions so I dont think he is. The argument that you have no position in the market when you have two positions going is really lame though. You would think they could come up with something better. To defeat their argument and I have already done that is show an official bank/govt. position that hedging is a good policy. I did that with the Indian announcement to protect their banks was to hedge. That destroys everything they say because the really big boys, Indian banks and others, see it as a viable way to protect themselves from negative moves in the market. Which by the way is exactly what hedging is that is why it is used in financial markets.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
wow... you all are dense. really dense. How many times I wonder it has been said that you are making money because you have an edge over the market. You are profitable because your edge or your entry method is allowing you to profit. The lock/unlock or hedge does not help you be profitable. I can replicate your trade results exactly 100% using a stop loss method. I demonstrated this already. The difference here is that if I use the stop loss method I will not incur additional costs. If you are profitable, you are profitable because of your edge. It has nothing to do with hedging. All hedging does is bleed you money for having no position in the market. It's like putting money under your mom's pillow but she charges you a commision for putting it there.

I'm going to make 1 final post here. I'm tired of doing this already. Every time I make a point, I do so with substantiated proof/math. I offer rebuttals on the core issue and provide explanations of why I believe something is not right. But every time the no SL group makes a comment, it always comes from experience, unsubstantiated claims, unprovable math or simply fuzzy, unclear explanations. When pressed harder for proof or clarification it always ends up being brushed aside as unimportant. Worse, the core issue is completely ignored and the topic is pushed around. In the end, there is no solid argument or rebuttal to the core subject matter at hand. I will stop posting here until one of you can actually go beyond using tribal knowledge, experience and unsubstantiated claims as "proof" that your method works.

Wow, insulting others seems to be your only "argument". Wrong. It helps a lot. Wrong. You cannot. Only in your fantasy. But not in real life. Why do 95 % of your SL buddies lose constantly money in Forex ? Wrong. I can demonstrate everything on a historical chart. I can double or triple an account on a historical chart in one day using SL and not using SL. Everybody can including you. But not in real life. Hedging is part of the edge. If you spell the word H e d g e , you will find the e d g e. Look here: H edge . It is obvious, isn´t it ? Wrong. I profit from both positions. You better stop using insults, otherwise you will end like LazyPawn and others who did the same. If you are not able to express yourself in a civilized manner, you should look for professional help.

Now we resort to name calling. Your mumbo jumbo example demonstrated nothing of real value. I have studied Mathematics, Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial science (some distinctions here and there), and had to deal with my fair share of proofs. I think any of my professors in any of these fields will roll with laughter if I present this mumbo jumbo as some simple maths in order to proof something. The most important thing that I learned in my studies is how easy it is to blindly misuse stuff in the wrong context, or not to understand the weaknesses on which a subject matter is build. I more often see statistics used as propaganda or for some or other profit motive by certain industries, reaching questionable conclusions which easily mislead the masses. These days even scientific and medical journals often publish stuff that is later shown to have been made up out of thin air. The so called "peer reviewed science", but where many academics these days have some conflict of interest due to industry paybacks etc. Hey, to each his own. I think I have said enough and will focus on something more constructive. Thanks for putting up with my babbling nonsense. Hope it was at least entertaining.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
@fxtr you are the definition of using tribal knowledge, unsubstantiable claims and experience as proof that something works. Something that nobody else can understand unless we do the same thing as you do. Your posting of these kind of arguments as proof do very little to sway believe. @pa_pips I pose a challenge to you then. Can you prove that our maths is wrong? If you can, then we have a fresh new discussion to start. And falling back to something "this does not happen in real life" does very little to sway our thinking. Because we can't back up your experience or tribal knowledge or claims with anything other than your word. If you would so kindly write a book and publish it on borders then maybe we have to take your words with a more serious tone. Until then, you need to provide more evidence or arguents that directly refutes the core of the subject.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
I can respect TH as a person and a trader. But two positions in the market is not a nothing. Math has nothing to do with it. Because of people who think like you hedging has been banned in the USA. But you could not be more wrong. There are people who trade long term and use weekly, daily and even monthly charts. They will hold a position for weeks or months at a time. While they hold a sell position for months at a time doesnt mean they should not be allowed to do short term buys. But because of idiot thinking and simple mindedness we no longer can do that because of misplaced thinking about hedging. It is this very 2 dimensional either or and never anything else thinking that blocks you from seeing this. It is clearly understood by us. I have two positions going in two directions at one time and both of them can be made profitable. That you cant comprehend that does not make us dumb, stupid, and poor traders. It makes us see something you cant. It is that simple. Your position that it is a nothing trade is just wrong. It is two positions on a pair both placed for what every reason the trader thinks he can make them profitable. Your math does not hold up to the two position argument. Your position only holds if both positions are liquidated at the same time. But not one of us have ever debated that but your whole position is based on that. Your SL is permanent the hedge positions are not so here is where you are clearly defeated in your argument. If he holds his second position one more pip than your SL he wins every time mathematically every time. Your math goes down the drain every time. That is why your math is not logical or works to prove your point. Sorry guy but that is the fallacy of your position. Hedging, holding two positions at one time in opposite directions can and does benefit a trader who does it right. I easily see it, I am sorry you cant. Even though I may seem cross at times I dont mean to be. I do respect your ability to debate honestly and fairly. We just really disagree on this point.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
I just googled "tribal knowledge" and it is obvious that you misuse the word here in order to make lock-unlock and using no SL "negative". Tribal knowledge is any unwritten information that is known within a tribe but often unknown outside of it. I have written down everything there is about lock-unlock. Why do you claim that it is "unwritten" and "known within a tribe but often unknown outside of it" ? There is no tribe of lock-unlockers. We are not organized. Why do you claim we are ? I made no unsubtantiable claims. Experience must match theory. If something does work, experiencing it is proof. Do you agree ? It is easy to understand. I have posted everything there is about it. Why do you claim you don´t understand it ? On a historical chart everybody with a brain can draw entry-points and exit points and tell you how you become a millionaire. The only thing you and others are doing is: "But I would go long there. And I would go short there." With that kind of "arguments" you can prove anything, even that using no SL will make you a millionaire within 2 days. But real life is different from your fantasy logical mathematical theories. Wrong. You can look at a chart and see it yourself. Since you have the description of the method, you can just enter anywhere, lock and unlock and win. Why do you need "my word" for it ? You are making unsubtantiated claims here, one after the next. Writing a book ? Come on. Why ? It is all in this thread. Nobody needs a book about it except you. I don´t need to provide anything. And what is the "core of the subject" for you ? Maybe it is something different to each of us ?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
I did not say your maths is wrong, merely that it does not proof anything meaningful related to long term profitability. You anyway provided an example. My understanding of mathematical proofs is that it tends to be expressed in general terms, show that some thought have been given to on what "self-evident" assumptions it is based, sets out exactly what it intends to proof as well as what some of the inherit limitations are. It is a building process where aspects are carefully build on each other and where every building block has already been proven, before being used. It has more to do with the scope of the maths than the maths itself. Perhaps the impossible possibility is that maths is not always required or does not provide a final answer? I think the arguments in this thread is based more on a basis of different perspectives. Where we sit or stand communicate more clearly, than anything else

Of course it does, it's impossible to defend the indefensible with reason, logic, and math! Anyone who dares highlight these issues is a threat to the bubble in which these nedgers operate! Interesting comments from NFA on the subject of 'hedging'........ ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The other trading practice NFA believes must be addressed involves a strategy that FDMs refer to as “hedging,” where customers take long and short positions in the same currency pair in the same account. NFA is concerned that customers employing this strategy do not understand either the lack of economic benefit or the financial costs involved . Several of the FDMs told NFA that they had not offered the “hedging” strategy until their customers requested it. Although many of the FDMs admit that customers receive no financial benefit by carrying opposite positions , some FDMs believe that if they do not offer the strategy they will lose business to domestic and foreign firms that do. NFA has two major concerns about this strategy. First, it essentially eliminates any opportunity to profit on the transaction . Second, it increases the customer’s financial costs in several ways. One way it increases costs is by doubling the expense of entering and exiting the transactions. In the on-exchange markets, a customer who carries opposite positions will normally pay twice the commissions. Similarly, a forex customer will pay the entire spread twice (buying at the high end of the spread and selling at the low end) rather than paying half on entry and half on exit. Additionally, the customer pays carrying charges that always exceed the funds it receives. In a normal transaction, a customer receives “interest” on the long position and pays “interest” on the short position. Since the two transactions are mirror images, you would expect the receipts and payments to zero out. In practice, however, the amount a customer receives on a long position is always less than the amount a customer pays on a short position. Since these transfers occur daily when the positions roll over, the loss increases continually over time. The costs described above are integral to the strategy, but there is an additional cost that could occur in certain circumstances. FDMs typically determine the equity balance in the account by calculating the liquidation price of the individual positions using the bid rate for long positions and the offer rate for short positions. If the customer holds contemporaneous positions long enough, the carrying charges will bring the equity below the required security deposit. Furthermore, if the bid-ask spread on the currency pair widens, as may happen when volatility increases or the FDM anticipates major market events, the customer’s account equity may fall even faster. If the account falls below its security deposit requirement while the spread is wider than normal, the account could be liquidated at unfavorable prices even though the customer has no currency exposure risk. NFA solicited comments on banning the practice, and two commenters agreed with the proposal, stating that the practice serves no economic purpose . A third supported the ban without discussing the reasons behind it. One commenter that operates an institutional forex platform as well as a retail one indicated that institutional investors never use this strategy . --------------------------------------------------------------------------

That pretty much sums it up for the gazillionth time. Someone said they studied mathematics at university, and asked for a mathematical proof: When you "hedge", you have one positive (long) position, and one equal but negative (short) position in the same currency pair. Let us call the long position "x", and the short position "-x": x - x = 0 for all real numbers x Therefore, when fully "hedged", you have no position in the market. There's your proof.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
No incomplete math problem (x1 + 25) + (y1 + 50)= +75 if X1 (buy)= Y1 (sell) both taken at the same time but closed at different times, then +75 is the correct answer. You have one buy and one sell in the market you have two different positions operating simultaneously. Two things operating simultaneously are not a nothing. How would you like the front tires on your car to become nothing when your make a right turn and they work together simultaneously? That would be a very interesting dilemma for a physicist if that was what happened in the real world. That is the fallacy of your argument and why you look absolutely foolish to us that can't think in more than one possible outcome. Dang you guys can't think more than one step, maybe I am wrong you are not 2 dimensional thinkers but single dimensional thinkers. How did you get out of 2nd grade when they introduced 2 step math problems anyway? I bet you really get lost if you were taught 3 step math problems. This is such simplistic thinking on your part, how do you survive in a complicated world??

--- 帖子 #685 ---
That is not a good example because in forex additional "costs" doesn't have to apply. You can always make the same exact amount of profit with one trade having an equal net exposure as multiple hedged trades. The only difference is you will be incurring additional costs with hedging. To use your example, you are paying costs of $500 to make $1000 (50%) when a trader who doesn't hedge is paying $100 to make $1000 (10%). The percentage of cost may be inaccurate, but it certainly is less than your costs while gaining same gross amount.

Fred has bought some AUD and hopes to hold it for 1000 pips. Halfway there, he thinks it may retrace for 300 pips, and so he sells a few to catch some of this counter-move. Because he wants to keep his original position intact, and because he can't be bothered doing the numbers, and because he needs to mow the grass, he simply spends a few extra dollars in spread and opens a "hedge" trade. Click. Done. All I'd say is, "Not ideal, but good on ya, Fred. Hope it works for you, mate. Hey. Forget the grass. Care for another beer?"

if X1 (buy) = Y1 (sell) both taken at the same time. If you enter at the same time then x=y. The difference then becomes when you close them. The math problem presented earlier did not express the variable needed to complete the math statement. The variables being when you close what is your net at that time. What happens before the net is irrelevant. I mean this really is multi level thinking. Your math problem is simplistic, you immediately did not understand multiple variables when I entered them into the equation. If you dont understand that there is no argument that will ever settle it for you. It is that simple. I have also learned not to debate people who are penny wise but pound foolish. They never see that increasing a business cost can also increase their profit. You immediately went back to the 10% thinking somehow this increases your profit when often in real business it does not. It limits the size and scope of your business. The concept of increasing percent of cost to profit ratio leads to a bigger profit is beyond some peoples concepts. If you cant see that or know that as a business principle there is no use debating this any further. I understand people not getting it. That is very clear.

The Nanningbob Hedging Formula - I can solve this. 1) (x1+25) + (y1+50) = 75 2) x1 = y1 Solving for x1 and y1, we get x1=0, y1=0. So according to the NHF , if we buy and sell at the same time, the answer is zero. :nerd:

You'll listen to all the gurus till they lose all their money. Stop loss is where they take your money. I've been trading a similar strategy for weeks, not one loss. It's a bad trade only if you stop it out. One word of caution, only take trades with the major trend. If it goes bad for a while, it must go back to the trend. It has no choice. And a trend reversal takes more then a couple of days. If a trade is going bad, hedge it with a divergent pair. Just my Humble opinion of course. Honor Him and He will keep thy way straight.

Just so that I get this right because I am sure that I am missing something.. If I take a long trade, perhaps based on the current long term trend and manage it according to my money management but further down the line an opportunity presents itself to also short the pair even if it is just a quick scalp, then at the moment both trades are open, mathematically I have no trades open. I then close the short for a win, pips banked even though the math suggested that I did not have a trade open. The original trade then continues as predicted and is then closed beyond the open of the short trade, pips banked. According to the math I had no trade open, but my bank balance has now increased, some call it nedging, others call it trading. The math of course can't be disputed, and neither can an increasing stash. According to physics we cant make something from nothing, but x1 =0 and y1=0 has just produced a profit... M.

One of the problem about no stop loss is that, u may open many hedging positions temporary. And that is one problem i cannot do to trade, as mentally, i am blocked to close my earlier trade, and i only buy if my earlier negative trade is buy, despite my analysis for that day is sell. My mind get stopped . However, i do agree this strategy works. as u don't get stop out easy. It works before for me, i grow a small account of $1000.00 to another $1000.00 with 1 dollar a pip within 1 month of 1000pips growth. But soon, fundamental market happens with Aussie selling crazy, and my leverage nearly reach margin call, i then closes my losses at the retracement value. and Re-trade again. The draw down can be huge.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Yes that is it but when you are dealing with a 1 dimensional thinker, it does not compute. The first grader knows more about math than they do and did you see them choke on a basic pre-algebra problem. It was completely over their head. The bottom line is you now know they are so inept, to dialogue with them further is a total waste of time. Imagine trying to reason with someone that doesnt even understand 1+1=2. That is really hard to fathom but we have evidence of adult human beings that still dont know the first math problem a child learns in first grade. Amazing world isnt it.

If I buy 10 apples, i have got 10 apples,, if i sell 10 apples I have zero apples.., yep, got that... but in trading I have a bet on +10 apples and seperately a bet on -10 apples... and both can win. But the math says I cant win with zero apples!! The +10 and -10 apples cancel each other out to zero, or perhaps an apple core( these contain pips remember), but I can still win.. something from nothing... amazing. If I place a long, I then have a long trade, now trade that as a trade on its own, if I place a short, then I have a short trade, now trade that on its own, how many trades have I got on simultaneously? According to the math its zero..., hands up those who have still got no trades on. M.

Moddy butt one of my favorite pissbulls....lol i realy like the system x= 25 y=50 so if i understand right i open 2 trades 1 long and 1 short ? and the first that hit 25 pip profit i close and then the other one turn and i close it at 50 pip profit ?? ?? or is it close the first one when it hit 50 pip profit and then the other turns and i close it at 25 pip profit ?? wich one of them do we use ??

Ah, lilly, my favourite non helper. You go for it mate if your unsure where to bet. I trade an opposite when i think the market will retrace, nedging i think its called, close that, then close the original at some point in the future, always from your favourite method that has no stoploss.

you are so easy.....lol

Is that your final answer? Are you sure you don't want to phone a friend? hmm, no he did not. I see you are also having trouble reading. Once again, you are the one that needs to go brush up on your math. Please do! It could, but therefore you should apply money management skills. Do not get yourself in that position. Yes, one trade could be -2000 pips, but if it is hedged, the net position could be -100 pips or even +100 pips. It doesn't have to be negative. Really! You try to simplify a scenario, yet you can't comprehend it. Yoh, wipe that egg of your face. Another one who simply can't understand what was written. Or is it the math that confuses you? Why do most assume that a buy and sell would be opened simultaneously? Maybe that's why you can't see the benefit of hedging. You just can't think beyond that.

Only for you lilly, as always,

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Pfft. That's just overlapping long and short trades. We all do that. I wouldn't even call that nedging. The fact that some platforms, like MT4, show your position as hedged is just the way those platforms work. Who cares? I want to hear more from that pan-dimensional thinker and mathematical genius nanningbob. I have so many questions. Just how many dimensions does his mind actually work in? Has he worked out what the [-] button on his calculator is for yet? Maybe he'll come back tomorrow and share some more of his amazing mathematical insights with us.

Great stuff man. You continue to make an ass out of yourself.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
So hedging or nedging doesn't even come into the discussion, it's just two trades, one long and one short, right? If you think price is going to retrace then why not just take profit and reverse the trade and then take profit on the retrace by reversing again for the continuation of the trend? Aside from that, if you're long 10k and then you short 10k you're flat (no apples), you have no position, no exposure, and no potential for profit. You simply can't escape that fact no matter how much you ignore math, logic, or common sense. If you believe otherwise then please explain. As regards nedging, NFA examined the strategy in detail and came to the only sensible conclusion, it simply has no financial benefit. Brokers agreed with them. Experienced traders agree with them. Institutional traders agreed with them. Hmmmm....it seems according to some on here they were all wrong, heck they should have consulted the multi dimensional thinkers on FF!

I would like to know how I can buy a negative 10 apples at my local grocery store? That is funny. With the eur/usd I can buy 10 euros and I can buy 10 usd but how can I buy a negative 10 apples. Fuzzy math there. The desperation to prove that 2 different separate trades, one where I buy euros and a second where I buy usd, does not equal 2 trades but is 0 trades. Where did these guys go to school to get an education?? How absurd is this going to get?? I have been in some interesting debates in my life but 1+1=0 is the most absurd and mentally deficient one I have ever seen. Are these people really that stupid?? It is no wonder why they cant understand a middle school math problem that uses variables. Where were you when they taught you beginning algebra in middle school? Like the one guy said this is very entertaining except there is one problem. These guys really believe 1+1=0. So lets see if I have 0 trades and I close one of them then what do I have? Better yet if I close a trade that does not exist, how can I close it and bank my profit? Interesting dilemma. Then that means the negative trade, all trades start as a negative trade because of costs to take the trade, does not exist and i cant lose money on it? Hmmmmm lets see if a bank would see it that way and take it off the books because in their world of reality it doesnt exist. PIPMUTTS new trading strategy, 1+1=0 method. You can take two trades by the nedging method. Since they dont exist in reality you cant lose. When one is in profit you can bank the profit and the losing trade disappears because it doesnt exist. No one ever loses. Dang maybe this guy is really on to something. Brilliant strategy. Looking forward to Pippys new thread teaching us how to trade using his new fuzzy math that two trades taken dont exist. 1+1=0 wonder what indicators he will use. We could apply this concept to all two line indis like the Sto. Both lines disappear because they equal 0 now. All married couples are gone because 1+1=0, they dont exist. Wonder if the IRS would accept that as an argument so married couples would not have to pay taxes. HMMMMMMMMM Pippy may be on to something here. This could be the breakthrough of the ages. WOW this could be utterly fantastic. I could see the clerk at WalMart trying to ring up a negative 10 apples, maybe they would give me money back for them. hmmmmmmmmmm

When trading Eur/Usd you're trading one against the other. If you think that 10 eur equals 10 usd or visa versa then you really are in trouble! One quite obviously cancels the other.

I predicted if you give Pippy enough rope he would hang himself. A negative 10 apples. I had apple trees on our farm when I was young. My dad would tell me to go get x number of apples for supper. Wonder what he would do to my bottom if I came back with a negative 10 apples?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
There's a link to the document in this thread somewhere, also you could do your own research on the subject. Is it coincidence that NFA, brokers, experienced traders, and institutional traders all agree? You, apparently, know better than all of them. Hmmmm.... Well there has been some useful and effective legislation introduced recently to help protect retail forex traders, and that's always welcome albeit long overdue.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Let's see how that works. Trader A and trader B are both excellent traders, both reading the charts and fundamentals the same way. Both buy the euro at 1.30 with a long term target of 1.40. When the euro hits 1.36 they both think it will first go down to 1.33 before finally reaching 1.40. Trader A. Buy 1.30. When price gets to 1.36 nedges by opening a sell position which he then closes at 1.33 (= 300 pips gain). The main long position is closed at 1.40 (= 1000 pips gained). Total 1300. Trader B. Buy 1.30. When price gets to 1.36 and correction is expected he closes his long position = 600 pips profit. Sells 1.36 - closed at 1.33 = 300 pips profit. Long reinstated at 1.33, closed at 1.40 = 700 pips profit. Total 1600 pips profit, that is 300 pips more than trader A (the nedger). Where does that difference come from? It's exactly the 300 pips wasted by the nedger when he had both positions open. If on the road from 1.30 to 1.40 we have multiple retracements and every time trader A hedges while trader B closes his main position, takes profit on a short, then reopens his long, things look even worse for A compared to B. The only way you can make trader A gain more pips than trader B is if you simply give him an edge in reading the market (e.g. trader A knows that a correction is due and hedges while trader B doesn't "feel" it coming and does nothing). But then of course the profit would be the result of being better as a technical or fundamental trader. The money management by itself will always (assuming equal trading skills) favor the non-hedger. It should also be mentioned that the above scenario is in fact the ideal one for the nedger. In the real world of forex trading the nedge is not used by many to increase profit on an already profitable trade by catching a small reversal. It is used when people try to minimize the losses on a trade that went south (because they refuse to use SL). A much more common occurrence is the next: Trader A buys 1.30 ... price drops ... at 1.29 he sells freezing a 100 pip loss. The price drops to 1.2850, he grabs a small 50 pip profit thinking that price will go back up to 1.30. But it only moves to 1.2925, then falls again. Around 1.28 he panics, sells again. Now the difference between the 2 positions is 200 pips. He only banked 50, but he has a 200 point floating loss. The price moves up and down, and every time it reaches one of the extremes a position is closed for a small profit ... however the next nedge is opened even further apart. The 2 positions end up being separated by hundreds of pips and invariably at one point the trader discovers that he is bought at a top and/or sold at a bottom of the current price range. I have done extensive mathematical simulations of various nedging techniques and found them to work only when: 1. The price never leaves a well defined range (e.g. never lower than 1.20, never higher than 1.40). 2. The lot size is very very small compared to the account size, allowing for drawdowns of many thousands of pips (and don't forget the margin, plus the swaps). OR 3. The trader/system is so good that he/it can never get the market direction wrong more than 2-3 times in a row ( see the pdf I attached earlier with detailed explanations).

At least someone can give a sound explanation of their position in an intelligent way. Good show. Much better than the 1+1=0 stupidity. The only thing that I would add to this argument though is those that trade long term like that do keep their original position all the way through and do sell the dips in the UT. What they do in real life though is add 2 or more positions to the original as price continues to move up. So they compound their positions by adding to them rather than your scenario of sticking with one position. So their first position would be still a 1000 but they would add a second and pick up the 700 on that too for 1700 and then the 300 for the sell position for a total of 2000 pips. I am not debating your well thought out and excellent argument. You did very well. I am just stating how the long term position traders do trade such scenarios. While their position is hedged they have guaranteed their existing profit in case the fundamental changes when price goes down. They have locked in their original profit and then look to add a second position when the trend continues. They also close part of the opening position along the way and take profits here and there. That is how they do it in real life. Me I cant stand trading long term like that. I like weekly trend trading the best.

Let's hope that does the trick, nothing else seems to have driven it home! I think that's the illusion of profitability for these guys, they're banking profit so think everything is ok. The unrealized loss is ignored or considered not a loss until it is realized, they don't seem to understand the significance of available equity. Exactly, and it's a waste of the most important assets a trader has, equity and leverage.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Yes, that is exactly the 10 page document that I referred to. In the document itself there is no link to any study to backup the statements made. Unless there is another document that you are referring to? I suppose you can read it that way, but no who am I to say that? The point is that the document consists more out of statements made set out in either legislative manner or political democratic tone. I would not place it in the category of detailed academic substantiation of facts. This is a document that need to be read within a given context, produced by a body with certain interests in mind and one can therefore say representative of that particular USA body's point of views.

LazyPawn only repeated what was already known but pipmutt thinks it is the "final victory" for the SL believers. It is not. Because the way LazyPawn constructed the "defeat" of the lock-unlocker is fantasy only. He doesn´t realize that his fantasies do not reflect real life. Because in the real world 95 % of the SL-believers lose money, some get a margin call. The whole SL dogma is wonderful in theory and LazyPawn and others will "win" every argument, but reality is different. Now, please explain to us why 95 % lose their money with placing their SL behind the last Swing high/Swing low or S/R line. The only explanation I heard from you so far was: those 95 % are idiots, they are too stupid. So, where do you place your SL if everybody is stupid who places it where 99.99999999999 % of all forex gurus teach you to place it ?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
lol, the names you guys use, lock unlocker, recovery, counter trade.... But anyway...... Ideally you place it at a level which if b/reached indicates that your analysis was wrong and/or the trade/analysis is no longer valid or viable. Where that level is will obviously depend on your strategy and your analysis, unfortunately there is no one-size-fits-all answer to your question. This isn't just about analysis and risk management though, there are some big psychological issues behind the use of no-stop strategies, issues that are ultimately detrimental to a traders longevity and performance over the long term.

I appreciate your argument and way of arguing. I find this quoted section very insightful. You mentioned at the outset that trader A and B read the market the same way. However, at this point in your argument trader A and B are not the same person anymore which from my perspective illustrate the point very well. I would not know if I could read the market better at a given point, than I am reading it. All that I am trying to do is follow the market, cut my losses and let my winners run. Hedging is a tool that I use to do this. My hedging is part of the cost of doing business and is relative cheap in comparison to 500, 1000 pip movements. And no, I am seldom flat as I will add positions in the direction of the flow of the market. However, I cannot deny that I am flat at some points and that hedging is therefore part and parcel of my strategy.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
My perspective is that the assumptions set out at the start of LazyPawns argument is key. Everything else is built around it. If one understand that any proof is bound to the assumptions that is made then you understand the limits and scope of use of the theory that is proven. That is why I appreciated his argument, due to the fact that the assumptions is stated in no uncertain terms. I think that dovetail nicely with your reference to reality, as it is very difficult (if not impossible) to state precisely the full set of assumptions underlying it.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Contradicting yourself here aren't you? So if brokers truly benefited from traders hedging, do you really think they would've agreed with the NFA? So much for your NFA report. Maybe you should've read and understand it yourself first before posting it. I believed it was Bob that said that you'll hang yourself if handed some rope. Well you did it again!

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Yep, that works well. Because my way means I only open 2 trades, you open 3. How about keeping the first trade open, open the opposite on the retrace and bank some pips, now take another trade in the same direction as the first one and let both trades run? My beef with the various arguments against opening the 2nd trade before closing the first is the assumpion as in lillys example that both trades are opened simultaneously from the off, and that is not how I trade. Quite often i have various trades open, depending on how fast the market is moving, I do not use the charts, mt4 is used to place orders, and i do not have time or the inclination to place a s/l as I do not require it. Lazypawn thanks for the explanation but it isnt required in how I trade but thanks for taking the time. M.

95% losing is a forex chunk o' bull, has been for years and will remain that way... reality based on actual facts is 25% making profit, 75% making losses... based on 2011's figures.

Hi LazyP, The maths is wrong. That part in bold indicates that trader B has opened an additional position. Meaning at that point in time, he is net short. Trader A at that time is having no position from his nedge. All else being equal, the ending pips should be the same. Meaning that closing a position vs hedging should produce similar profits/loss. I did this math already. The only difference is that hedging incurs additional spread and additional rollover. ---------------- @bob: Your math is not proper. I've done headaches like fouriers and eulers in uni. If I can make sense of those things, I should be able to make sense of your math. However, the truth is I cannot because you are 1)Not defining your variables properly. 2)Not stating your logic correctly. Either the above or you are really bad at explaining a concept in mathematical terms. The main issue with your maths is this (based on my understanding): -You assume that a buy trade is x -You assume that a sell trade is y - You are assuming that both of these variables are mutually exclusive . Meaning they are separate entities completely. It's like saying "I have a potato and a carrot. How many items do I have?" Of course the answer is 2. That is why you can come up with 1+1=2 (assuming x and y = 1). There is nothing multidimensional about your way of thinking. You are just assuming that a buy trade is a totally separate action from a sell trade and they have nothing to do with each other. And you come to this conclusion just because the brokers shows 2 open trades in your platform. However, sad to say this is not true. A buy and sell action is entirely related. That is how we come up with the maths of: x + y = 0 (assuming x means buy, y means sell) 1+ (-1) = 0 This is the problem we have with your logic. This is the core of why we disagree. The reason is because a buy and a sell are not separate entities. You need to go back to basics. Pick up a book on finance. -When there is a long position, you can close it by using a sell market order. You have no net exposure. -When there is a long position, you can close it by using a sell limit order. You have no net exposure. -When there is a long position, and you hedge by selling the market, you have no net exposure. The only problem with closing out your position using the hedge method is you have to pay spread and rollover twice. ------------- The only benefit of the hedge is to keep yourself sane if you have many many trades open. If you are a very long term trader holding positions for months and you have like 15 open trades, then maybe you can justify a hedge. So that it simplifies your trade management. But when it comes to monetary values, there is no benefit to the hedge!

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Nice explanation and I understood that. I count them as separate trades in my debate because that is how I would look at them and treat them. One is a buy of Euro and one is a buy of USD. They become different trades because where I close them is two separate issues. That becomes very clear when you close one out you still have one more to deal with yet. That is why you have to look at them as two separate trades, you have to close them differently to have any purpose in them. To open two positions at the same time and close them at the same would be kind of stupid but it does prove that they are two separate actions not a zero. So there is no way you can convince me 1+1=0 because when you close one you still have one left. That should be very obvious and logical. Anyway time for bed. Good luck with your trading this week. I had a very nice week selling aud and nzd almost every day last week. Looking at the GBP possibly being a bear. Last week I predicted the gbp/nzd as a buy and it went up around 300 pips before retracing some. This week I like gbp/usd and other gbp pairs as a sell. See how it goes.

Amazing ,,some realy belive the rubbish... when it comes down to basic....what you actually claim is your never wrong..it doesnt matter where you enter and wich way...cause price will come back and you always just wait and take the profit... 1: your always right..... 2: you just not always timing your entries right..but no worries it will always turn out sooner or later as a winner. 3: while waiting on the bad timing entry to profit.....then you use the time to make good entries for profit here and now.... trading is easy...lol

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Sure, trader B would have 3 trades, trader A only 2. But that's exactly what happens! It is our premise, it is what those 2 traders do, if they both assume there is going to be a retracement. The nedger keeps his initial position open, and adds a short. The traditional trader closes his original position and opens a short. I was answering a post suggesting that nedging could be beneficial when one anticipates a retracement contrary to the main trend-following position. I think it's clear that by closing it you win more pips, as I showed. There is no logical reason to maintain your long when you think the price will fall. Take profit on it, go for the short, take profit on that one too, then buy again - you win more pips that way. Regarding Bob's main point, I think I see why he considers the 2 trades as being separate entities and not cancelling each other out. Bob assumes that they will be both end up as winners. However we don't have such guarantees. Every price we see on the chart, at any moment, could be the next top or bottom for months or even years to come. In Bob's worldview, getting 2 profitable trades is clearly different and much better than no trade at all - who could argue with that? Given his particular way of trading, using extremely low leverage, it makes sense for him to see things like that. If you have a lot of patience and trade extremely small, eventually almost all positions become winners. It's a scenario I talked about in my previous post. And even if you are left with a buy on top the floating loss you have on that position will be neutralized by a large number of small wins. For most people that is not a practical approach though, because if they can still smile when their floating loss is 2000 pips then most likely taking the 50 pip profit is not going to make them happy. Unlike many others I see how Bob's strategies can be profitable and I see why he is in no danger of losing his account even if he works without a SL ... it's just that I don't find it the most effective use of margin and time and it doesn't suit my personality. However if there is one truth that is repeated over and over again by people who have spent their life studying what successful traders do it is that there are many completely different paths leading to success in this business ... so it's definitely not my intention to tell others what to do, especially when they enjoy their strategies and have a steady equity growth.

Bob, I have a degree in physics. In physics, there is A LOT of very complex math. There is a lot of linear algebra, and even more differential equations. While the math we do is not quite as rigorous as what pure mathematicians do, for you to imply that I can't solve a 3 step math problem is an absurd statement. I understand there have been a lot of insults thrown around in this thread, from both sides, but I don't believe I have insulted you, so I would ask you for the same civility. I think the problem with your thinking is that having two opposing trades on is not considered "1 + 1 = 0", but is in fact "1 - 1 = 0", and you guys are trying to say that somehow 1 - 1 = 2. I think you don't realize that two opposing trades in the same pair offset each other, no matter how you slice it. It is not about timing. If you have a long position that is +100 pips and then you hedge it, you have effectively CLOSED THAT POSITION. Your 100 pip profit is now locked in. You may as well just close it instead of hedging, because you don't have to pay another spread or overnight interest in order to do so. You say you have two positions at that point when you become "hedged", and when you close one of them, then you expose yourself to the market again. What you are in fact doing when you close one side of your hedge, is that you are actually OPENING A POSITION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TRADE THAT REMAINS. I have said all this before, but maybe you missed it in this long thread. In any case, I have done everything I can to prove that "hedging" is counterproductive from a theoretical perspective. The only thing that remains, I believe, is to take a page out of merlin's book and issue a challenge. I will be starting a new thread that will CHALLENGE ALL HEDGERS TO PRODUCE A SERIES OF TRADES THAT EXPLICITLY SHOW HOW THE TRADER'S PORTFOLIO BENEFITS FROM THE METHOD. A real monetary reward will be offered. I will post a link to it in this thread once I have it up.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
OOoooooo. Now we got someone other than merline who is willing to put up a challenge!! Wow. This is biggggggggg &gt;_&lt; Anyway, I want to disprove your argument bob... To begin with, you cannot just simplify a trade into buy euro and buy usd then treat them as seperate entities because ultimately, your inventory cancels out. 1)If you buy eurusd, you are buying euro. But you also owe some usd. 2)If you sell eurusd, you are buying usd. But you also owe somebody euro. Let's use an analogy: Let's say you were at work one day and you went to a bank to get 100 eur. The bank will give you some euro if you agree to give them 100 usd + some small fee. you +100 euros, -100 usd (buy eurusd + spread) Then you decided that you didn't want euros anymore because they can't be used to buy anything in the country you live in. So you want to change them back to usd. But you are not able to go to the bank yourself because of work. So you asked your wife who is back home to use her own 100 euros and go get the 100 usd at the bank - telling her that you will swap it when you get home from work. Of course, the bank will charge her a fee just like before. Wife -100 euros, +100usd (sell eurusd + spread) - hedge method (coz your wife is not you. At this point, assuming nothing else happens, you are flat. You have no position.) Now... in a stroke of luck, you suddenly needed your USD back urgently. So you talked to your boss and got permission to head out to the bank. You exchanged your 100 euros for 100usd. Again paying the bank a small fee. you -100euros, +100 usd (Sell eurusd + spread) Now that you already have what you need, you told your wife to change back her currencies as you don't need it anymore. Your wife again heads out to the bank and does as you say. Paying the bank a small fee. Wife +100 euros, -100usd (Buy eurusd + spread) - hedge method At the end of the day, your wife makes a big fuss because you made her go out and exchange currencies for nothing and incurred bank charges for nothing. May god have mercy on your soul for even hell hath no wrath like woman scorned! ---------- Now... What happened was, you just opened 2 positions but you are flat. And you have paid spread 2 times. It is an oversimplification of things because we didn't take into consideration the movement of a pair and rollover. But the essence is still the same. You could have achieved the same result without the woman's fury if you just went out and did your currency exchange by yourself. (no hedge method) Which leads me back to bob's argument. Ultimately, they are not separate trades because in the end the inventory is still yours. You need to move back to basics. Just to reinforce my point: On more professional platforms like interactive brokers, they do not make a distinction between your open positions. For example for every position you open, you need to provide: 1)buy/sell 2)lot size 3)order type (market, limit etc) When you want to close your open position, you also provide the same parameters. You have to indicate: 1)buy/sell 2)lot size 3)order type (market, limit etc) They do not say "close" like in MT4. If you don't know your stuff, you can be in a lot of serious trouble. I've personally see some people accidently adding positions instead of closing positions because they messed up the "buy/sell" column.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Yes I understand your words. What I'm saying is that in your example, the no hedge guy did an extra trade that made him go net short. If you wanted to make it fair for the hedge guy, then you should allow the hedger to place an extra trade as well. Either that or you allow the hedger to place a much larger sell position so that he will end up net short. Like I said, all else being equal, a hedge and a no hedge strategy should produce 100% similar pip counts. The only exception should be that the hedger needs to pay extra spread and rollover

--- 帖子 #739 ---
That is a very clear and correct explanation.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
I can confirm that Currenex is the same. So we have 2 professional level platforms that do not allow hedging vs. MT4. Hmmmm. The clients and designers of Currenex probably couldn't solve a grade 2 math problem .

I thought we already dealt with the fallacy of this example.. and moved on. Why are you flogging it about again?

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Currenex, like other higher end platforms, accounts for positions in terms of exposure... Plus, in an effort to keep trading costs down, most institutional traders would rather execute on the closing leg of the swap than open a new position that has to be closed later with yet another transaction.

Precisely.

Dang, all of this writing and it takes one sentence to defeat it. If 1-1 = 0 then why do I still have 1 trade left when i close one? That is because 1+1=2 Merlin's challenge is a farce because there is no way to collect on it. If he puts the sum up in a neutral bank so I could legitimately collect on it. All I would have to do is place two trades. Let one profit, let price reverse and let it profit and prove him wrong and collect. The problem is I could never collect the money because he would never put it up into a neutral bank for collection. Because you guys dont accept the most obvious point, that they are two separate trades, the premise and the offer is a farce. Your base position has a fallacy, they are two separate trades taken at the same time. That will never change. Whenever you close the positions at different times proves the value of the trades taken. One position taken for long term and one position taken for the short term. Both are legitimate trades for legitimate reasons. There I defeated his argument and can prove it by taking two live trades and making them both profit at different times. Now give me my money. Stupid offer. My position on the matter is proven 100% correct in that both positions can be made to profit. So that ends the debate two trade both taken for a profit. Money is not truly offered as a real offer it cant be collected so it is a farce.

Amazing ,,some realy belive the rubbish... when it comes down to basic....what you actually claim is your never wrong..it doesnt matter where you enter and wich way...cause price will come back and you always just wait and take the profit... 1: your always right..... 2: you just not always timing your entries right..but no worries it will always turn out sooner or later as a winner. 3: while waiting on the bad timing entry to profit.....then you use the time to make good entries for profit here and now.... trading is easy...lol

1. "fallacy": A mistaken belief, esp. one based on unsound argument 2. "flogging": Promote or talk about (something) repetitively or at excessive length. The last time you used the argument that all stop loss orders are set at prices commonly hit, that all SL users put their stops in places that are likely to be run, I responded with this: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...17#post5640417 Specifically, I pointed out that you're mixing up the tool (stop orders) with the method (where some traders place them.) Further, it would be illogical for any trader to witness the high likelihood of such a level being tested, and choose to place their stop there anyway (heck, if they saw it was as common as your post made it seem, they'd place their entry order there instead.. since that's the action with a higher positive expectancy.) Instead of defending your claim, you deflected my dialogue with a comment about how stop hunting was just one aspect of this argument... trying to avoid further criticism without coming off as 'wrong'. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...32#post5640432 So I thought you were done making such assertions.. having deflected direct criticism of your statement instead of defending it. Yet, here we are again. I hate repeating myself, so if you're going to pull a Bob and just ignore what you can't respond to (no offence Bob ;P), while continuing to post the same thing in error over and over, then I'm just going to wish you happy trading and leave this alone.

No one said you can't make money on both sides of the "hedge". What I am saying is that I can replicate the exact series of trades without "hedging", and actually end up a few pips better off because I pay less spread and possibly less overnight interest. BTW, when you close one side of the hedge, you don't "have one trade left", you have a NEW POSITION IN THE MARKET. When I get around to posting the new thread I will be sure to spell out the rules exactly, so that there is no misunderstanding.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
I am actually very sad that nobody read my examples. Or they read it but just would not accept the fact. My example is so clear and so precise of why hedging is in fact not a mutually exclusive event. Bob. You may open 2 trades and they may show up as 2 trades on your MT4. But in the end, the "inventory" is yours. If you go back to basics, you are owning and selling currencies. Regardless of how many positions you open you are still doing so from the same pool. That is why it is not a separate and mutually exclusive trade. You can never get 1+1 = 2. That is not how the entire financial trade is based on. Right now you are just refusing to accept facts that have been around since the beginning of a market. ------- And I'm sure if we search hard enough, we can eventually find merlin again. I'm sure twee or some of the older people here have emails they can pull out. If you can prove that we can't replicate your trade 100% by not hedging, I'm sure the trading community will be very interested in your findings. In fact, you could probably get a doctorate for disproving hundreds of years of basic finance.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
When you close one side of the hedge, that's another trade, so again it's either a +1 or a -1 (depending on which side you close). So, let's say you have a perfect hedge +1, -1. At this point you are flat (your net position is 0 and you don't care which way price moves) because 1 - 1 = 0. If at that point you close your long (closing a long is selling - the same as taking a short, so it's -1). At that point you have 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. You have a negative (short) position in the market. At this point, you want price to go down.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Hey I read your examples and agreed. I was already on your side though...

--- 帖子 #752 ---
lol it wasnt meant for you but all is well.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Thank you. I do read your posts and accepting your opinion is not the same as accepting it as a fact. Bringing in Twee and Merlin in and using the same logic wont change anything. I have shown you the following: 1. Both trades buy and a sell can be placed in the market and both become profitable. You answer you incur costs, you would incur these costs anyway so that is a wash. You place a lot of emphasis on swap costs. That is a problem of high leverage trading not low or no leverage trading. The lower your leverage, the less money you are borrowing when you trade, the more insignificant it becomes as a cost. Swap costs mean nothing to me because I am a low leverage trader. So from now on you can throw that argument out because it is meaningless argument to me. 2. Position long term traders trade multiple positions long term. That they have to close them because of some fallacy argument that you cant hold positions in two directions at the same time is ridiculous. They have no reason to close their long term trading strategy to take advantage of short term market conditions just because you have some misplaced logic about hedging. 3. This leads to what the real issue is here. You simply dont accept the fact, and it is a fact, that markets can be traded from different points of view and trading methods. That is why you guys are so frustrated and have this thing about, "You will never admit your wrong." I dont have to admit I am wrong. I just trade differently than you do. The fact is my account goes up over long periods of time, whether you like my trading style or not, I dont give rat's a............... I have never one time accused your trading method as being wrong. I have challenged some very bad opinions though as false. 4. Finally and this has been brought up as a constant. If I knew how to trade I wouldnt trade any other way. If I knew how to accurately enter the market, have an edge, I wouldnt trade any other way. That is an elitist argument. I can defeat that whole line of thinking with one statement. If you are entering the market with such accuracy you wouldnt need a stop loss because you would be so accurate. The very fact that you have your SL hit shows that you didnt enter the market accurately. This is the real problem and issue. You have an elitist mentality and cannot admit there are other methods of trading. Is this a fact? Yes. Can I prove it? Yes. Here is my answer to your elitism. Go study a COT report. You will always find that people who trade in the Billions of dollars do not trade like you do. Why? Because there are always an X amount of traders buying and a Y amount of traders selling and they are not using tight SL like you do, nor do they trade high leverage but trade very low to no leverage. Do they hedge, errrrrrr hold buys and sells at the same time? YES, they do. They will trade long term sells and do short term buys or visa versa. And both trades will be profitable. An that sir ends the argument because your opinion will never change the facts. I dont care how many posts your write or how many Merlins, Twees, or other traders you bring in. You cant overcome facts with opinion. I think that just about does it on that issue even though it will continue because there are people in this world that cant see things from a different perspective or point of view. I get your point of view, I understand it. I dont agree, my growing account and those of others and those who have to report to COT show that. 5. Oh I almost forgot 1+1 will always equal 2 and that will never change. So quit the crap with 1+1=0 or 1-1= 0 when you really have two trades going on at the same time. Dang never in my life did I ever think I would have to defend 1+1 sheeeeeeeeesh. Only on the internet could that every become an issue.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Bob my good sir... If your conviction is as great as you believe it to be, I look forward to your book in the near future on hedging on the same pair. If you choose not to write a book, at least post your discovery in an intellectual body such as universities. I believe many professors of finance will be interested in your discovery. In fact, who knows, they may even award you a phd for your thesis. If you do write a paper on this, do link me to it. I will more than be happy to read through the entire thesis without bias as I always do with any paper.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I'm sure they read your examples, facts don't seem to make any difference though, which goes some way to explaining why these people 'trade' the way they do and refuse to accept the patently obvious. They know they can never prove it with clear examples so they avoid the challenge by blowing smoke. lol, this thread is so funny, watching people squirm trying to defend the blatantly indefensible........

--- 帖子 #756 ---
My trading methods are public knowledge and an open book. Just go to my 10.2 thread and read. You wont find hedging there because I cant hedge in the USA. If I could I would have no problem holding onto any long term positions while I take the opposite position on a short term trade. The idea that I cant trade long term and short term at the same time to me is very silly. Because of such silly rules you overcome this by having two accounts. One for short term trading and one for long term. It was easier having one. I suppose in your thinking I would have to go into my long term accounts and close my buys so I then could go to my short term account and do a sell. When the sell is done I could then go back and reestablish my buys in my long term account. Dont you see the absurdity of that?? I think the vast majority of traders would.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Yes. Like I said before. The absurdity only applies if you have many trades that you need to manage. Then hedging becomes more of a management tool - in order to simplify your daily life. That is the only benefit of hedging. In terms of monetary value, hedging brings no additional benefit to the table. In professional platforms, if they want to do what you are doing, they would simply sell a larger amount than their buy, putting then in the net short. Example: If you have a 1lot long open position, and you want to do a short term sell trade, they would sell 2 lots. Effectively putting them into net short 1 lot. When they want to close that short trade, they would again buy 2 lots. Effectively closing their short position and going net long 1 lot. By doing this, they pay as little cost as possible. Everything is done on 1 account. Absurd? No not at all, because their objective is to get ultimate and maximum gain. Paying for additional costs for nothing is just a strategy they will not tolerate.

I am not the kind of guy to sit and talk i am a action guy.. action is the only thing that gets us traders to anywhere.. so i am not going to argue about your logic or etc, even though i can say a lot.. so.. Ok Bob.. Merlins offer is a farce.. others are stupid and got no logic or don't know math or etc,.. ok.. wouldn't you think at some point you'll need to prove all this one way lectures of yours for years!!.. make it real.. how about just open a small 5k explorer account and trade it like you preach.. prove to all these guys and the world that you are right in your way and more importantly it actually makes money.. bcz at the end its all about profitability and at the the end all this talk and arguments is not going to get anywhere, agree.. show us how x+y= 2 actually sums up to profit in real world.. show us that you will consistently close x and y which sums up to 2 is always positive disregarding traders ability.. show that its not wishful thinking.. or your recovery techniques actually work with real money on the line. or.. I am also willing to go head to head against you.. you trade your way with your whatever hedge, nedge, recovery, lock unlock BS and I just go with simple trading using lets say no more than 50point sl.. whoever last or is more successful at end of the year will collect all the money of the other guys account.. you may say this is also farce.. but at least this one is wide open in the eyes of everyone and only a coward will flake on this.. if you accept, I swear to the soul of my late father that I will stand by my word.. I'll even throw in an a insurance for you too, if you defeat me or even if you are successful somewhat i will pay 5k (initial deposit).. not to mention that if you prove your way, I am sure it will benefit you in many other ways.. at worst you can sell many books, lol who knows.. I on other hand just be happy with your money if you have not blown the account before the year is out which is my prediction by the way. heck, for all i know I need something to motivate me to actually sit and trade like a beast as i used to, just that will be enough of a reward for me. Whatta ya say Bob, deal!!.. if you got other offers i am all ears too, I work with you to your taste, how about that. i am sure you will either ignore this proposal or called names or etc,.. but i thought to give it a try and put myself on the line as well. Anyways, I'll hit the Tennis court for now, I am hoping by the time I get back we have got something going. Good trading to all.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
P.Dean, the whole point of the thread is the profitability of using no SL. Nobody doubted that the SL-believer can trade with higher initial risk and thus be way ahead of the no SL guy (if he belongs to the 5 % or 25 % group which makes money in Forex). Your suggested competition is besides the point.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I already have done that in the past. I posted every trade before I took them for one year. You can go the Nanninbob 4H trading 5.0 to see past results and every trade for 1 year. No holds barred you will see my winning trades and losing trades. My winning months and the occasional losing month. It is all there. If you want my present trading system you can visit me at Nanningbob 10.0 and see us trade the 10.2 update of that version every day. Like I said I am an open book and trade what I preach. The problem I face here is how they say I trade and what I actually do you will find are two different things. You will also find professional traders from all over the world will drop in with suggestions and ideas from time to time. So that challenge was taken years ago. You will find that I am a very highly respected trader who is only disrespected here by this very small and tiny group of people. Welcome and you will see I have one of the largest followings at FF and also my stuff is posted on other threads elsewhere around the world.

Its not a real account performance Bob with all due respect.. the whole point is to do it day in day out for real in a real live account. If it is real, than accept my apology but i can guess it has not and it is not due to none existence of new FF offering of explorer account where the account holder is fully protected from all privacy matters and i can tell your not a man to expose your account in the ways of the past by handing out investor key. I myself have done many live trading as such as well, but we both know that its not real yet in the public eyes and its logical from their point of view, not to mention an explorer account provides useful statistics at all times about account performance. respect is irrelevant and over rated in the online forum world.. respect is earned when one leads by example in reality. I think guys in your caliber as you claim to be should do this otherwise respect is dead and right out the window at this moment. come on Bob your talking to a real deal here. anyways, offer still stands..

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Well lets put that to test as to more of who belongs to the 5% or 25% winners. I say the no sl believers do not belong to that group when is all said and done, point blank.. no sl believers for a fact are just simply a holder of the money and will give it back sooner or later.. its like the casino money where it actually becomes your money when and if you leave the damn place.. i want to see if you and your friends in here are skillful enough to do that and even to prove the possibility of it.. i know it is not possible.. but who cares what you and i think, we can argue this to the moon.. that's why suggested competition is the necessity to settle this. by the way fxtr.. i am willing to put my money where my mouth is and i told you this couple of days ago too.. so the next time you talk at me be for real or just sit in the corner with all due respect brother. I do not argue i settle shit for real.

And by the way...they ofcourse use real live accounts.. they are very advanced traders and succesfull,,they just wanna give something back to those who strugle....but people who are so stuck in a box,,and refuse to think outside..will never be succesfull.. you need to think it as a buisness...Loss,profit.loss.....freeze loss. take profit when its due...never use Sl the brokers are crims... remember price always comes back....

Yes it was a live account and I did show pics of the account at times. I did it because a very good trader (I think BillBlass was his name) challenged my thinking and trading principles. So I went live with every trade. Since I posted them at the beginning of the JPY session and they were good for the whole day there was no running from them. Now I dont trade that system anymore because I have gotten better and the market is more volatile but I could still trade it and make it work. But yes that was real. I give my thoughts for the week after the open and the weekly pivots have been posted. Last week was a banner week and I pocketed +1452 pips in one week. Most but not all the trades were posted. There were other traders who followed and posted gains of 800 or more for the week. That is also leaving no trades in a carry over. I think you will like 10.2 as a very solid trading system. It deals with the basics of top down analysis, using weekly and monthly pivot lines, MA lines as trendlines, and a readjusted slope indicator to signify the strength and direction of the trend. I may do an explorer account but at this point I still am doing testing of the system. Guys willing to contribute are more than welcome. Anyways be interested in your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Just in case you ask my SL is based on percent of an account not a fixed position. I use 1% as my loss line, sometimes I will make an exception but most of the time I will close before that point because I know its a bad trade. So I use very wide SL and give my trades room to make a profit.

I use the sl the same way Bob the only difference is I trade in the shorter time frame. but i was under impression that you do not use sl period.. i must admit i have not read your stuff (your threads) as i do not read a lot of stuff in ff so no offense. the fact of you using sl now changes things a bit but still the use of wide sl and reliance of recovery tricks dose not change my bias about your trading. about your previous post.. you say the account was real then.. so ok, i believe you i was not around then and wont help to go read about them now nor will put up the time to do it.. but it was not a explorer account as to what I am suggesting here and it be nice if you do seriously open one.. to be honest i think is necessary for you to do so.. bcz perception is reality my friend and at the moment there are doubts about you, if you care or less.. believe me it takes less energy for you to do so than constantly defending or arguing you case here and there, I think you might concur with me in this case. there is a saying amongst us Tennis players that I think it highly relates to trading .. "Let your racquet do the talking" . action speaks a lot more than words. my offer of explorer thing is and will still stand. With all due respect and i am entitled to my opinion as you do forgive me for saying, I do not think you are a profitable trader or as profitable that one needs to be in this business. I just put this to rest Bob for now, unless you pick up on the offer and we can get to as how to go about it in detail. regards,

Question on freezing the position: don´t you still get a margin call, although you have the same (or close) amount profit on the other subaccount? That ´s what I want to do...guess a way of preventing big runs is to put a stop and TP at same level some hundreds of pips away...just in case...after that transfer the money from the winner subaccount to the looser to level things...

If you read my material, you will find out what is said about me and what I do is two different things. You have to remember these guys are out to win a debate not represent truth. Even though I have explained the differences in where and why to use certain trading techniques, slander and ridicule is the rule of the day. I trade three different methods, trend trade, range trade and counter trend trades. Each kind of trade uses different methods of trading. I can explain the different ways of trading but in a debate they love to mix everything and try to make it look ludicrous. Straw men arguments are their favorite form of debate. I no longer have any patience or respect for several of these guys. I mean if you if are really honest about it, you would recognize that two trades taken at the same time or days apart or on different accounts or even two different brokers is still two different trades. To argue and debate and call it nedging or what ever is just plain stupid to me. You can argue the wisdom of it but say they are not two different trades is just plain dumb. The wisdom of the trade is in how close it. Anyone can start a trade anywhere on the chart but where you close the trade makes the difference on being a winner or a loser. I see no difference between a successful trader who trades short term or a trader who trades long term. They are both successful and make money. Buy and hold strategies can be just as successful as popping in and out of the market. Anyways I have stated my point and have successfully defended 1+1=2. You can never get around that fact, never.

[quote=Andy B;5544182]I think the point the non-believers in lock/unlock are missing is that risk is being limited to the locked range This is not the same as having no SL, far from it Exactly the hedger guy just "parks the loss" (unrealized) in the hope the market returns, and by constantly taking profits on the other side...those floaters have a very real chance of becoming winners...or BE...whilst the stop loss is dead money... The locked range is the similar to a dead stop , but only similar...cause it´s hedged..and alive....

Both SL and hedging users can be successful. The thing is those who say hedging cant be successful couldnt do it thats why. I used SL in my trades years before and failed miserably .Checked back i used to have 30% winning trades..so no edge there. But using hedging i dont care about winning rate..i will be concern about making profits then eventually killing the loser..then still be profitable. Not much to celebrate about but 3% per month is acceptable for me. I used a 'stupid' system ..just ema..just turn the whole set of trades into profits. But i couldnt do it if i was trading only one pair... i need 2 pairs in several trades to make up the losses in the initial trade. I remember i hedged a EU -252 pips stinker trade into profit. In the end this trades is still -240 pips in dd, but during the time i booked in 250pips in profit counting the -ve swap using the other two pairs. Those days trading with stops... i still remember getting struck in 10 losses in a row stopped out..that was in 5min trades trading S&amp;R. Looking back and now i still suck trading with SL. If i want to say the best in strategy utilising SL it has to be the "big dog" strategy breakout or anything similar(session breakout)..thats time proven. For me , both strategies with SL and hedging does work.But it the end of the day take it with a grain of salt. You chose whatever you wanted to believe.

Agree! so much discussion in a good thread... I propose the people who hate hedging, should stay away, (or be banned), and let the rest of us learn and improve in a civilized way...and if the "stop guys" are right, well... sooner or later we should be blowing our accounts anyway... so why bother , we will be punished from our "sinfull trading" by the "Forex god" anyway...they should stay away... Nobody is obliged to agree, or asked to speak...

I have never masted a hedging strategy. I was interested in it at one point but lost interest when I had a demo account and had 15 hedges going on at one time. I had worked with a guy where we tried to use hedges instead of a SL. I decided that I didnt want to deal with that and stayed with recovery trades and SL. Since I cant hedge here in the USA there is no purpose in me pursuing the strategy. My thoughts at the time was to do just range trades on a BB and then hedge any trades that broke outside the bands. Undo the hedge when they came back in a break the trade back to 0. I dont know if it is doable or not but some of you hedge guys may want to practice the idea. My thoughts were, since the market ranges 70% of the time, I would have a very high win ratio trading both ways and could protect myself during trend runs. That is as far as it every went. The problem in even discussing such strategies is you need your own thread and someone who will block out the anti-hedge one dimensional crowd. I dont know if such a thing would work but it was my only idea that I thought would work. In other words you would never play the trend only the ranges. Hedge the trend and trade the range. God these guys will have a field day with even talking about the idea. I am not going to try to defend the strategy since I can not trade it or even find out if it would work but I offer to the guys who seem to have a handle on such things. The others if they dont like it, so what!! it is the open discussion of a subject that teaches traders whether something works or not. Not the negative harassment. However, I do not believe you will ever get a fair open discussion of the subject in this thread. I really dont have time to pursue it further. One last thing, I also dont think it would work with high leverage trading because of swap costs but it might work with low leverage/no leverage trading where swap costs become negligible.

Bob wouldn't you think that the best way to shut people up is to let your trading do the talking!!.. that's all I am trying to say.. open a explorer my friend and trade it like a champ and in the mean time you sever a more efficient purpose to your "massive" followers. ..debates are never ending in real world, now go figure on a online world. Bottomline rules in trading. best of luck trading this week.

Some people have different ways of relaxing. When I am doing my copy work on the copy machine at school, it gives me something to do. LOL. Anyway it is trading time now and my time will be spent with school and trading. I was attracted to this thread because I trade the 4H a lot and love to hear what this guy Nacho had to say about trading his system on the 4H. Well, kind of never got around to that.

[quote=cuchuflito;5662975] I advise you to learn how to trade. Floating loses are still losses. Hedging is just a more expensive stop loss.. please educate yourself. It took me a while to realise that. Any body who is succesfully using hedging, WILL BE MORE SUCCESFULLY if it will be using a stop loss or just not using HEdging.. please give me a succesfully trade using hedge just you just made and I will reply to you with the answer by using stop loss or just closing the positions (avoiding expensive hedge) and still get the same result in pips or more.. I dare you, or anybody who is blinded.. give me any trade or set of trades that you made using hedging and I will show you how you don't have to hedge and still get the same profit, or more... Who is taking my challenge?

It is not about this thread or your thread or I or you read each others threads or whatever a heck else in that sort of nature.. it's about showing real profit.. can you be profitable.. if yes.. show it for real with a explorer account, cut and clear. I am saying that your are not a profitable trader i don't think you ever have been.. if you ever were you would not have any problem taking up on this at least once in this forum. I got nothing else to say to you Bob, my point is very clear.. i am not into he said she said, debates, conversations or this or that.. can you trade and show profitability!!, that's it. I know your overall trading philosophy and it is not a winner, does not fit reality, i know it bcz i been around the blocks.. you say it is a winner and you are such and such.. ok fine.. show it.. for someone who produces booklets and such at least is obligated to show real results day in and day out for at least some time. I highly doubt you will ever do and most likely will respond back to me with something else.. my point has been very clear from the get go and i look forward to it if you ever take up on it. i don't know what else or how else i can say it.. i am talking competition and reality your responses are off point. i can care or less how many or who respects you or how many thread you got or how many booklets you have sold... can you trade for real brother!! I know i am wasting my time but its interesting and proves how your beating around the bushes in the eyes of everyone. anyhow i am done unless you take up on the offer. best of luck.

It's extremely unlikely he'll take up your suggestion, he'll find some excuse or other. The thing about Bob and others like him is they're trading pennies. If their strategy was viable then they would have scaled up long ago. Faced with a direct question or challenge he always blows smoke, it's really all he can do in the circumstances. -

unreal.. ok that pretty much settles it for me. "If I wasnt making money I wouldnt be bothering over the years with this this".[/quote] you seriously think this statement is convincing and sufficient. forget it. Bob you don't make money.. and it's ok, bcz there is a lot of you 10+v with loads of lectures in here which adds up to nothing. if the statement above insults any off the 10+v only respond back to me if you take up on the same offer I put up on Bob. take care i am done here with nonsense.

Tell you what, I've got a counter offer for you that will make it worth it for both of us! Put up $100k and I'll add you on IB as a (UXXXXXX) managed account (Friends&amp;Family) and I'll take 50% of the profits I generate. In addition to that I'll even guarantee to cover 50% of the losses in the event your account is in deficit! We'll make a legally binding agreement as to the terms and conditions so we're both protected and know exactly where we stand. There, that's a much better idea! Are you up for it? NB . This offer should not be construed as a solicitation for funds or investors, it is a hypothetical offer only and no suggestion or guarantee of return on investment is expressed or implied.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
no its not ideal.. you wanna trade with my money and cover half!!.. you must be joking. ..your going off point here bud. I want to know in the first place if one is capable of even putting up a small amount such as 5k of his own money and trade it for real as he believes it and preach it.. like Bob has. Plus, there is no doubt there might be some here that do make money.. if they present them selves like Bob has and i review it and disagree with it then i present the same offer as what i have put on Bob. so easy there pipmutt.. i hypothetical accept that you are a profitable trader and no interest on you proving yourself.

lol, I didn't honestly think you were that gullible but hey it was worth a shot wasn't it, you can't blame a guy for trying! Yeah I realised that, but I think you'll find they're all trading a couple hundred bucks (some less), they can afford to mess up and it's no big deal. It's not serious trading, it's playing trader. If they had faith in their trading ability and the profitability of their strategy then they would have put up 5k a long time ago, some of them have been trading pennies for years, like you (or someone) said it's hardly enough to pay utility let alone make it worth the time they spend!

couldn't agree more.. I may add, making pips its different than making money and be actually profitable. I used to drive a bug when i was making pips.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Where do guys like you come from anyway. I love your argument: I is a trader. You is not a trader. I win. bye. I already proved my profitability, I dont have to reprove what I have already proven. If you are too lazy to go over the evidence that is not my problem. I have already had this argument with these guys and I dont need to go over it again and again. If I show them all the pips I won, that is meaningless any one can make pips. If I show my account balance and its increase, that is meaningless too. Since we have already covered that ground in a previous debate I am not going prove something I have already proven. Love these guys and their egos. I is a trader, You is not a trader, I win I win. Have a good day guy.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
I am shockingly surprised with your reply.. lol ya Bob you win with you pants over your head hiding. Stick to the classroom Trading and being a Trader is way out of your league. I got a live account in the eyes of everyone to see and currently 4 live trades going on.. what do you got besides your you know what in your hand and hiding. get lost. I am done here with this guy.

You believe a guys statement Pippmutt who started a thread and never got past page 1 and disbelieve a guy who has 500 people a day downloading my trading manuals because they know they will make money. You expect me to take you seriously with a judgement like that. LOL you are way too funny. You had your mind made up before you even posted your first post.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
This actually is a great post! I'm still trying to follow the discussion in this thread, still at page 12 or so and I don't want to get into this holy war raging here. But I think you have it right when you say we need an environment to keep emotions out of it. Coming from a strict S/L-background I realized some months ago I do feel better managing trades that turned bad than eating the loss while still being positively focussed on a new setup. Eating the loss makes me angry and fearful of a new trade, dealing with a bad trade makes me calm. I'm coming from a managing background, so I'm used to 'fit-hits-shan'-stituations, I guess. I'm more relaxed and as of now get into better setups in the first place. Regards, LD

--- 帖子 #806 ---
An important point, rather than wasting time, focus, energy, and equity holding on to a losing trade in the hope it comes good it's better to cut it loose and focus on a new setup, infinitely more productive in the long run, from every perspective. There's also the psychology of managing a losing trade and the (subconscious) filtering of negative market information to suit bias, that's a bad habit which needs addressing if one wants to become a truly consistently profitable trader making more than pennies!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Huh? All that proves is just how many people are lost!

--- 帖子 #808 ---
I don’t believe you or him or anyone else in the forum for that matter unless one has shown proven results.. your past live trading has not been on a day to day live account such as explorer where it reveals everything that one needs to know, you need to get modernize Bobby baby old tricks don’t work in this day and age no more. Your making me to bring the hammer on you now. I have been listening to you for days in this thread and prior to it in Al’s thread (another loser who is looking for investors) where you all talked about recovery tricks and etc,.. so I believe what I believe based on your own words.. don’t try to twist things around just because I had couple of replies back and forth with pipmutt who you got a beef with who I had not seen or heard of prior to this thread. I am simply challenging your ability to be displayed for actual profitability, that’s it.. I don’t think you are a profitable trader based on trading style that you have proposed here for years, and I can care or less how many days or how many who and what downloaded your journal, its simply irrelevant when it comes down to display of proven results and actual ability to trade. I have reasoned with you to the max up to so far but you on other hand tries to stir away with off point replies and etc, which is too obvious to spot.. Not to mention your disrespectful words to me couple of replies back. Grow up Bob, its about time man, you got kids growing up under your hands as a English teacher that you say you are. Bob the fact that you say you don’t take me seriously is bcz you are the P word, besides not being profitable. Keep play with that play money or pennies and make zillions of pips which sums to 5 bucks a day at best. I just displayed a live trade good for $160 on my explorer account for everyone to see.. again, what do you got Bob.. what!!.. 1500 pips behind the close doors.. be real man. that's all i have been saying all along with no other intentions. However, I must be crazy to keep responding back to your nonsense today though.

Say I sold at 1.3000 Sell 1 lot @ 1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Let's say it's now 1.2900, I'm expecting a retrace. I move my SL to even. And enter a hedge trade. So I have Sell 1 lot @1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3000 Buy 2 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 I then turn off my platform and go to bed. Please give the non-hedge trades I can use to replicate this in MT4.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
OK I can respect that. Puts you way above these guys. Cant even get them to post a single trade. I have to finish my school year before I will involve myself with such a thing so I will put a start date of June for this. I will suggest a starting capital of 2500 and go from there. This could be fun and I always like a real challenge.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Easily replicated. Assuming you are doing this on MT4 Say I sold at 1.3000 Sell 1 lot @ 1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Let's say it's now 1.2900, I'm expecting a retrace. I close my position. Then I put a market buy order for 1 lot. Buy 1 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 If you are arguing that your original longer term trade is still in effect, I can replicate it by adding a sell pending limit order at 1.2950. That way when you close out your short term trade, the long term trade is reinstated. I can also go to sleep. No difference. But the main difference here is I will always pay less spread and less rollover than you. If you want to provide more details and simulate a more real market scenario, I can take up that challenge as well. Just tell me what you want to simulate and I will show you the math. For example, if you took profit at 1.2950 and price continued to move further up. According to my method, I would be in the negative. You think you have the upper hand because you don't see a negative on your account. But rest assured, the pip count between my account and yours will be the same.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Ok. I'll save you the trouble of challenging me. I'll provide proof anyway. No hedge method Say I sold at 1.3000 Sell 1 lot @ 1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Let's say it's now 1.2900, I'm expecting a retrace. I close my position. (+100 pips) Then I put a market buy order for 1 lot. Buy 1 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 Assuming price did move up to 1.2950 and my tp is hit. Also, the limit sell order is reinstated. (+50 pips) Open position: Sell 1 lot @ 1.2950 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Let's assume price continues to move up wayyyy up all the way to 1.3100 and the stop loss is hit. (-150 pips) Total pips = 0 --------------------- Now let's count your hedge method Say I sold at 1.3000 Sell 1 lot @ 1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Let's say it's now 1.2900, I'm expecting a retrace. I move my SL to even. And enter a hedge trade. (+100 pip floating) So I have Sell 1 lot @1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3000 Buy 2 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 Assuming price did move up to 1.2950 and my tp is hit. (+100 pips.)(For simplicity, I count 2 lot x 50 pip = 100 pip) Open position: Sell 1 lot @1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3000 Let's assume price continues to move up wayyyy up all the way to 1.3100 and the stop loss is hit. (-100 pips) Total pips = 0 *you need to remember that your original hedge is a floating profit. You did not bag the pips. So as price starts to move in the wrong direction, your floating profit began to get smaller and smaller. Eventually as it hits your stop loss, you get out with -100 pips. --------------- Bottomline: I replicated your no stop loss method using a stop loss. Producing exactly the same amount of pips - in this case 0 pips. The difference? No hedge method paid spreads only once. No hedge method paid rollover only for 1 position. If you wish to open up many many hedges, I can also replicate it. No matter how complicated the scenario, you can always replicate it without using a hedge. The pip count will always be the same.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Bottomline: You can replicate everything on a historical chart. You can double an account without using a SL within one day or triple it on a historical chart. What does it prove ? Nothing, absolutely nothing.

Hedger: Sell 1 lot @1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3000 Buy 2 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 You: 100 pips * 1 lot realised Buy 1 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 Sell Limit 1 lot @ 2950 (TP 1.28 SL 1.30 - I presume) Price goes down to 1.28. Hedger: 1 lot * 200 pips 2 lot * -25 pips total = +150 You: 100 pips realised 1 lot * -25 pips Sell limit not triggered total = +75 I am not convinced.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
OK Bob anyway you want it.. we get it rolling when your ready.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Bottomline. You didn't. I don't have a no stop loss method. I agree that using a hedge instead of a stop is moronic. My example had stops. Please pay more attention. In the example, I used OCO orders (SL &amp; TP) to close one side of the hedge. To replicate this, you need to use OCO orders to open a position. I am waiting to hear how this is done in MT4.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
You need an EA or script to do OCO orders in Mt4.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
You Are right! Kudos to pointing out my math. I forgot that I needed to add one more pending order. Say I sold at 1.3000 Sell 1 lot @ 1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Let's say it's now 1.2900, I'm expecting a retrace. I close my position. (+100 pips) Then I put a market buy order for 1 lot. Buy 1 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 I also put a sell pending limit order at 1.2950 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 I also put a sell stop order at 1.2875 TP 1.2800 SL 1.2950 (I forgot to add this in my calculation. Good job at pointing it out! ) Price goes down to 1.28. Hedger: 1 lot * 200 pips 2 lot * -25 pips total = +150 You: 100 pips realised 1 lot * -25 pips Sell stop triggered 1 lot * 75 pips Total = +150 Result is the same. And, the OCO thing... Any trade with a sl/tp in MT4 does OCO. Not an issue here. All my trades are similar to yours. In essence when one of my tp/sl is hit, it will cancel the other pending tp/sl order.

Hey 51 I think these people just don´t understand...if I were you, I wouldn´t spend a single key of my keyboard typing answers... Changing subjects: Put my first campaign today,(very small position to play around and practice..) I´m long, and short EURGBP...took profit 2 times and reiniciated, just like you propose, always only 1 trade open plus hedge if triggered....in the moment I have a separattion of 25 pips...I have no pending SL or TP, cause I want to go to sleep...so tomorrow morning, no matter which way the market went I´m still 25 pips diferential...I´m shooting for BE or little plus... If I can make it to turn this one around, meaning killing the diferencial. THEN BINGO.. Any system with say 35 % winners, winners are winners...potential loosers you fight them back... RESULT:$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Guess that´s basically what hedge Funds do...thought about this for years...the difference, is you don´t add positions, it´s always only 1 position...(per pair). THANKS MAN, it´s brillant! Hey, if people don´t get it...better so...keep it secret...and enjoy your profits

OK. Let's try again. Price is 1.2900 Hedger: Sell 1 lot @ 1.3000 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Buy 2 lots @ 1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 You: +100pips * 1 lot realised Buy 1 lot @1.2900 TP 1.2950 SL 1.2875 Sell limit 1 lot @ 1.2950 TP 1.2800 SL 1.3100 Sell stop 1 lot @ 1.2875 TP 1.2800 SL 1.2950 Price goes down to 1.28, then up to 1.31 Hedger: 1 lot * +200 pips sell wins 2 lots * -25 pips buy loses = +150 You: 1 lot * +100 pips in the bank 1 lot * -25 pips market buy loses 1 lot * -150 pips sell limit loses 1 lot * +75 pips sell stop wins = 0 You got unlucky this time, but the Hedger woke up with a nice profit.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Correction. The part quoted in bold did not happen. The sell limit was never triggered.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Ok... After giving it some thought, I see where you are going with this. And now I fully understand why you mentioned OCO. The truth of the matter is, Price goes down to 1.28, then up to 1.31 Hedger: 1 lot * +200 pips sell wins 2 lots * -25 pips buy loses = +150 You: 1 lot * +100 pips in the bank 1 lot * -25 pips market buy loses 1 lot * +75 pips sell stop wins = +150 But then my pending limit order still stands . When price eventually moves back up to 1.31 -150 Total = 0 You are right in that sense. Because MT4 does not allow OCO. Meaning that if my sell stop was triggered, I have no automatic way to cancel my pending sell limit. (coz right now I'm supposed to be sleeping and not at my pc) In this case, yes you are right. But if all else being equal, meaning if MT4 somehow manages to allow you to do OCO. Then logically the sell limit and sell order should cancel. But if you really want to go on about it, even though it could be improbable, you could argue that price oscillates so much between your sleep that it triggers every stop and ever limit order and then always moves against you. In that case, then yes you have found a positive use for hedging. Great job! You should go and ask merlin for you 100k in cash

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Right. Hedging is an unfortunate side-effect of the ticket based order system in MT4. Sometimes, if you are doing separate long and short trades it's simplest just to put up with it and eat the extra costs. This is not the same as the open-ended hedges some people suggest to "pause", "freeze" or "lock". These are always identical to closing a trade. Anyway, an honest broker would refund any extra swap costs incurred while hedged in MT4. Below is a list of brokers that do this: ... hmm. Can't think of any.

I went to your thread to see what you did and I respect anyone who shows their trades and talks about them good or bad. Most of the debaters here do not. So win or lose, agree or disagree, I can respect a guy who is open and public with their trading. Last day of school is May 30 here for me in China, gotta close out the year paying off teachers and closing up and then I can put my full attention to this. I look forward to the challenge. I also need time to understand and set this explorer account. So we will take a look.

Ladies and gentlemen. Euclid managed to produce an argument in favour of using a hedge that is more sound and solid than 56 pages worth of postings from any other pro-hedging poster here. His post basically sums up what I now believe about hedging. What he said in that few posts managed to sway my believe. I never expected to stand corrected but I am today. His example is concise, has well explained logic and backed up by undeniable proof. He attacks the core of the discussion and provides solid rebuttals. This is the example of a man who knows what he is talking about. We need more posters to emulate him...

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Freezing is not identical to closing the trade. Only in your fantasy. Therefore the core of euclid and thelws "argument" is wrong. But it is obvious they will never understand it.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
His argument is flawed because it seems to be based around the premise that OCO orders are not available on MT4 when in fact, with the use of a simple freely available script, they are. Having said that, his clear and concise examples in support of his argument were the best I've seen in this thread, in fact they're probably the only lucid argument presented in favor of nedging! e-lucid euclid, subliminal, intentional, or coincidence?

--- 帖子 #829 ---
The truth is, euclid did produce a situation that we can't replicate using a no hedge method. Even if you have a script to do OCO, if price oscillates enough to trigger every stop and limit order you place, and then subsequently moves in a non favourable direction, you will come out worse than the hedger. Notice that he did place a restriction that is "go to bed" meaning once we place our orders, we are unable to change our orders. So theoretically we can come out as losers. We cannot replicate a hedge method. Having said that, the actual probability of it ever happening is maybe very low. More often than not we will end up with lock-unlock situation. And euclid stated his position on this very clearly and that is

But some orders would be cancelled if others are filled. I suppose you could also add other contingent orders as well, there are several versatile flexible options, we're not just limited to the basic order types offered by the likes of MT4 brøkers. The only logical excuse for being long and short on the same pair would be convenience for trading different time frames (or if you're an institutional trader who doesn't know/care what other departments are doing!), but it comes at a premium.

This whole debate about No SL vs SL seems pointless to me.Waste of time reading 50x pages of debate that should be debated on the other thread that specifically discuss about this. The thread is about the strategy started on post one. Im waiting for an update so the strategy could progress ..being productive. This whole debate is like a husband/wife bickering right before a divorce. Nobody gained a damn thing just plain negativity. So what if the strategy goes into margin call etc ,his money his own responsibility. I did both hedging and SL strategies and both has it pros/cons..just do what suits you...but to force somebody this wont work ,this work and whatnot doesnt make sense. We got so many experienced traders here its kinda shame ... where is the respect here?

--- 帖子 #832 ---
No one is trying to force anyone to do anything, it's a debate on the pros, cons, and alternatives to using a stop loss. The OP specifically asked for opinions, comments, and views, I believe his request has been fulfilled and then some! Sure it gets heated, and some people have trouble expressing themselves and supporting their views calmly and rationally so resort to personal insult, that's people/forums for ya! Can't stand the heat? Keep out of the kitchen!

--- 帖子 #833 ---
True. With the use of a script, any MT4 hedge trade can be replicated with an unhedged equivalent but you're getting into quite a complex solution now to replicate what could be a very simple hedge trade. In trading, where mistakes can be costly, simplicity and convenience may justify the premium.

A simpler solution would be dumping MT4 .

A couple of thoughts... 1. Forex is a high risk way of making money, our strategy should always be to minimize risk and at the same time maximize profits.... If the strategy only does one side of this equations it is in effect 'not working'.. just surviving isn't good enough. 2. I don't understand how the money management of the strategy works? this needs to be explained and give you an 'edge' in the market', if there is no defined stop loss how much is your risk on each trade? just using very small lots isn't reducing risk. 3. Is it not possible you would end up with a scenario where all of your capital is locked into opposing trades, for months or even years? Everything that has made me move from erratic results to consistently profitable seems to be left out of this strategy.... just my opinion... Logical thinking tells me that although you might feel you are never losing, you're not actually winning either, which might seem attractive if you're in that stage where you are still struggling with forex, but, I don't think it is the route to persue.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I agree, but then looking at the OP's equity curve......mind you I've seen similar before, a nice smooth curve followed by a sharp vertical decline back to ~0, or like you say equity tied up for long periods of time. Is there any way to read risk and unrealised p/l on that explorer thing, it would be nice to see the most meaningful stats on R:R, or maybe even a sharpe-type ratio?

Hey "51" forget the discussion and let´s make some money here. Did my first campaig on a very small position EURGBP. Entry system is irrelevant...I use my own. I locked/unlocked 3 times. Closed the last leg with a total result of: 1,148 R profi t (R was initial risk), AFTER deducing interest paid! I added up the interest Oanda charged per position, positive and negative (most was negative) and it amounted to -0,0046 R, which is very small. Granted , the campaign took only 3 days, but for people that argue campaigns could last "months"...I don´t see that happening...when to BE I needed only a 30 pip retracement ,(show me a pair that went months in one direction without a retracement! The final profit happened because it actually retraced about 45 in my favour...then I closed.. I looked at the market every 3 or 4 hours...and let it unfold..whenever I saw convenient, closed a position and put a pending lock again just in case...the last lock never triggered and BINGO. No position was left unprotected at any time.All positions where exacly the same size. A SL strategy would have netted me a 1 R loss . Hey "51", I live in München , if you ever come around, let me know, and I´ll invite you to a nice bottle of Champagne downtown.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Thanks James question: you apply 10 pips profit against a 10 pip stop? I´m currently putting a stop on the other side of the 5 MA, and trailing on every bar. TP: a little more than 2 R (or double risk) Sometimes the 4 H trends for days, and many, many pips...just trailing on a 1 bar basis, or the 5 MA.. I use to scalp for 10 pips in the 1 minute EURUSD. Anyway, its all very interesting...I´m in positive $, this first week... Thanks again.[/quote] Damn pretty fast ,,you turned into to a Top trader. .

Actually since there seems to be several of you unlock/lock masters here, you should open a thread and then you can control the subject matter. You will never be able to post your strategy without interference this way. In my threads we talk trades and there are no side issues allowed. We stay on subject. So let me know if you have a place that the subject can be talked about. I dont think I fully follow your method but I know you cant present here clearly without a pile of interruptions. So good luck, I do understand the stopping of time concept of hedging and the key to unlock is getting a good CT trade going but I would be curious of how you do all that.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Hey Naning, I´m not a "Master in hedging" after only one trade..just learned from reading "51", on this thread.. He seams to be real good at it...from my first try...I can say...there´s all kind´s of scenarios possible (remember it´s an almost random beast)... BUT once you get the basic concept...it´s just like cooking...simple...good spaguetti takes a little more than hot water though..I´m sure you know that better than me. My thought: if I can recover one potentiall looser, and I pulled it on my first try...it´s definitely worth studying...I don´t care about the people against it...they´re kind of funny...but as you mention, a waste of precious time... I agree someone should open a new thread on the subject, and bann intruders who just want to disturb... I don´t know how to open a thread...don´t have the time it takes to answer every post anyway.. I will keep posting my experiences till then here... Hope "51" keeps posting his valuable input... I propose we all make it a rule NOT to answer to rude, or sarcasticall comments...sooner or later they will give up...after all it´s my money I risk...nobody´s business...and from their tone It´s more an ego thing, than caring to protect us from "sinfull hedging".

--- 帖子 #843 ---
what is it actually you try to acchive ??? if you try to convince anybody about a system/method....then explain it...or just shut up.. every other day here on FF...Gurus join,,,with theire new fantastic no loss systems......either they are just plain stupid or just planning to make a scam. No one of the Gurus now and in the past has never could explain how their holygrail works....

Everything you are asking for has been provided with screenshots and long explanations which can be understood by a first grader. But what are you doing here ? What is your mission ? Read what this thread is all about : Do you understand this ? You are wrong here in this thread, lillelise. Is it so hard to comprehend it ?

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Since I discovered the report-button, I will use it. The hijackers will get tired to see their offensive postings getting deleted and stop their destructive behavior.[/quote] Good on you 51! Back to my first trade: -Took profit 3 times on the short side. -My long protective Hedge was triggered in the beginning, and closed with a loss in the end. Adding it all up including interest paid, it came to the results mentioned before OSITIVE! Here´s an article I found on simple hedging, that´s pretty much what I did: "The way a simple forex hedge protects you is that it allows you to trade the opposite direction of your initial trade without having to close that initial trade. It can be argued that it makes more sense to close the initial trade for a loss and place a new trade in a better spot. This is part of trader discretion. As a trader, you certainly could close your initial trade and enter the market at a better price. The advantage of using the hedge is that you can keep your trade on the market and make money with a second trade that makes profit as the market moves against your first position. When you suspect the market is going to reverse and go back in your initial trades favor, you can set a stop on the hedging trade, or just close it. " (Hate SL )

fx51 i understand completly who and what you are...

(Hate SL )[/quote] By the way: Negative Interest does play a "non negligible", part. I calculate, that if it would have taken me 30 days to recover from the "initiall potentiall loss"...that would have eaten a good part of the R: 1,14 profit.. BUT still a small profit....maybe worst case BE. The trick is to master the recovery . Pick then, any half decent system....and youré surfing. Think : A typicall "good system": Win 4 loose 6 .... right? Ratio: 1 to 2. ...recover half of the loosers..(only BE). THEN: win 4 loose 3. Long run: $$$$$$$$$$ No need to waste time discussing "51"...just come over to Mü for that Champagne.

Sorry, I drink no alcohol, but many thanks for your invitation. Your first closed cycle of lock-unlock is a good experience. I did a few trades yesterday and today in my live-account and made 10 % yesterday and 6 % today. Usually I start with 1% risk. Locking 1% floating loss is no big deal for me and waiting for a pullback or a trendreversal in order to grab 20 to 30 Pips is no big deal either because trends of 200 - 1000 Pips offer plenty of opportunities for pullbacks of 30 - 100 Pips and more. Should we start a thread for the lock-unlock method ? I will not because I don´t have enough time to manage it. You know that the missionaries will appear and the trolls and it would need a continous work to keep the thread clean. I never intended to teach the method because what is there to teach ? It is so simple and everything has been posted already. Teaching traders systems which provide good entries and all that stuff has been done by others, I don´t need to add a new thread to the hundreds which already exist.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Well said and well done...awsome performance...best of success to you..."51" ....and thanks...that was my missing key...(I´ve been trading for 15 years...)... I´m short GBPJPY, protective lock didn´t trigger and I´m close to TP..so that´s an easy bonus.. Enjoy life!

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Yes that is true you have taught it but it has the train of thought has been interrupted many times. You own thread allows you to teach and those that want to watch or learn can stay on subject. Nothing like live trades to show how and why it works.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
good on you Bob, hopefully soon we will see those trades and how you handle them on a real explorer account.. seems like its starting to drop..

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Consider this: I´ve been shooting for 5% weekly for years...never made it... If I can recover only half of my losses...hedging...I´m there easily.. Take some humble 10000 Euros 5% weekly compound. It makes over a million in 2 years !!! (if you don´t believe me , just punch your numbers in an excell compound formula) Once I get there, I promiss to invite all these guys who are desperatly fighting for a STOP LOSS (wonder if they are secretly working for "BIG BROTHER BROKER") for a Big Bottle of Champagne in my hometown...maybe that will kick their frustration.. Oh I forgot, "51" doesn´t drink alcohol , (good on you), so we will get him the best fruit juice money can buy..served by the pretttiest waitress in town.. This is fun man...

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Yes, trading without SL is fun ( if done properly of course ). Just a suggestion: You could pick entries from the Price Accordingly thread of the troll P.Dean and use a very low risk, for example 0.1 % . You will get at least 2 or more entries per pair on M5 , so if you trade about 5 pairs, that is between 10 and 50 entries daily. Many entries will give you the 0.1 % profit without triggering the pending lock order. The others are frozen with 0.1 % floating loss and it is a breeze to unlock them somewhere and close the whole cycle at BE or in profit. Swap ? No problem, the market will easily give you the profit you need to compensate the swap costs. This way you can easily make 1 % daily without ruining your health. My daily goal is 5 % but sometimes I stop at 2 % , depends on the market and my mood. What are those trolls ranting about ? Either they should contribute on topic here with some reasonable postings or simply leave and shut up and respect the forum rules. Easy.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
G morning guys.... seeing the show already begun.. fx51 i would realy like to read more about the lock/unlock method, it seems easy...where can i find it ??? ..or could you be nice to open a thread and teach us.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
so fx51 your lock/unlock is like this : you open a trade ..lets say long 1 lot. it goes in drawdown 50 pips,, then you open a short 1 lot. ???? then what ???

--- 帖子 #857 ---
lillelise, what happened to you ? Why are you suddenly asking questions which already have been answered in the thread ? Tell me your motives please.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
interest... and cant find any explanition ..

--- 帖子 #859 ---
I will not do the search for you. It is all there and now tell me why you are asking questions about already answered things.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
so i understand my example was wrong ??

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Nothing wrong about your example, but the answers have been given already. Now tell me why you are asking questions which already have been answered . Tell me your motives please. P.S.: Thank you Admins for deleting the troll comments. It is such a relief. This thread is about discussing methods of trading without a SL. It is not about discussing No-SL versus SL .

--- 帖子 #862 ---
so if i understand it right...the example is what you call locking a loss ??

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Hey , just for the record just put 2 trades this week, roughly following "51" ´s concept... and "locked" 2 PROFITS.....

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Everything is already answered in the thread. Now tell me why you are asking already answered questions. What are your motives ?

--- 帖子 #865 ---
as i told you ..i couldent find it... Now tell me why you are using 3-4 lines to say nothing.. when you just could have answered yes or no ??? what are your motives ?? it cant be for helping people....why not ease up ,,and explain once more then..for some like me that realy dont get it.... we just try to understand...,,,

Hello! English is not my native language so sorry for the mistakes. "51" just wanted to say I find your method very interesting, I myself am testing a variation, but I'm not having success appropriate. So I registered in the forex factory. We have many very good traders here discussing something that is useless depending on how you trade. I myself started my strategy without SL, but I saw that not much point in "lock" because I do not know how to use the un-lock as well hehe ... I used the classic SL the way and made some changes ...... I succeed! But it means I can not succeed by using the lock-unlock ... just do not have the necessary skills, I believe. I would like to know everyone's opinion regarding the initial discussion and perhaps leave for something more like, the lot size, the influence of this style of trade swaps or hedging instruments correlated own. Sorry for english ..... blame google! rsrsrsrs Good luck to all!

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Why should I search the thread for you ? Tell me. You are not here to learn something. You have been insulting others only and you kept on being off-topic. Your new strategy is to give the impression of being on topic. You think it is a smart strategy ? It is not. Your new strategy is breaching several rules of the forum and you know it. Your new attempts to disturb the thread have been reported. I am looking forward to what the Admin will do.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Here are some forum rules: lillelise doesn´t treat others with respect or kindness. His new strategy as well as his offensive one-liners are mean-spirited and thus subject to removal. All members have the right to trade in peace and lillelise should not harass, attack or disrupt the threads of other traders. The other trolls got their mean-spirited postings deleted by the Admin and it was a big relief. The final relief will be the deletion of the postings of lillelise.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
anybody execpt for fx51 who master the skill of lock/unlock who cares to explain ???? here is what we got so far : 1 :the so called lock/unlock only comes into play if in drawdown. 2 : example : 1lot long goes into 50 pip drawdown,,,then open a 1 lot short..........status your 50 pip in drawdown... 3 : so what now.??..we are 50 pips in drawdown we sit a while and say damn ,damn,damn.. we then deside to open another trade 1 lot,ofcourse in the direction we think price will go...and hope and pray we will get the 50 pip drawdown back. 4..so far so good...but what do we do..if we are wrong the 3th time also. and it goes to another 50 pip drawdown ????

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Good Job fxtr. You have just forced your way into winning a debate by removing all potential debaters. Now that nobody is left to say anything, you win by default! Congrats on winning the special olympics. In the mean time, you continue to use tribal knowledge, personal experience and unsubstantiated claims as your only proof of argument. Anyone who doesn't agree with you or challenges your logic gets the ban hammer or gets called an idiot who can't possibly understand your great mind. When asked to elaborate and educate us, you claim to be above us and that it would be a waste of time to teach us. Ohnoes... what are we to do in the shadow your your holy greatness!!

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Sir you don´t understand the idea...it´s obvious... The only way to "get it", is to try it out yourself, maybe on a very small lot, or demo...once you are in the game, and instead of SL, you "lock" a position, THEN, you just need to use your brain and market knowledge,(which I´m sure you have), wait and see, as the market unfolds it will show you the answers...with some patience...you can pull it back to profit...it´s like a dance...maybe some trades don´t work, so you close like on SL...and start again. It is so interesting...maybe you just drop it after the try...that´s your own decision...but from your remarks, it´s obvious you didn´t grasp the idea behind it yet, that´s the core of the discussion... And I don´t think it can be taught , cause the scenarios are different, same as with SL, you need to know how to use it...on each scenario.. I´ve been trading for 15 years plus, won´t say I´m really good...but once I got this idea, working my trading system around it, seems fairly simple. Best of success to you anyway. I hate stops. By the way, today I closed my 3 "test trade" with real money....I made $ again...no SL was used. If I would have used Stops, I would have had 2 winners, 1 looser...ended up with 3 winners...and I deducted the interest on each position, precisely. Nice day to you all...

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Wrong. This thread was never meant to "win a debate". It was made to a battlefield by trolls, by SL-missionaries and such. All I did is to clean the mess. I restored this thread to a peacefull thread where traders discuss the No-SL method(s). How come you still haven´t understood the core of the matter ? Easy: behave like a grown up individual and respect the forum rules. I am not a holy greatness, I am just a humble troll-hunter and thread cleaner who prefers to discuss in a relaxed and kind atmosphere. Stay on topic and treat others kindly and if you don´t like trading without a SL, go elsewhere or start your own thread. Some possible topics could be: # "Always use a SL" or "Trading without a SL is foolishness and stupidness" or "Don´t believe those who teach a method with no SL" . You get the idea ?

--- 帖子 #873 ---
LOL no answers " as usually " what a surprise.. Lots of your paranormal traders,,here on FF lately. none of you Gurus/masters ever give an explanition.. you just show up..with some BS...claiming your douing this or that. when people ask how/when /where.... you never tell them how....but just to open a demo..and pratice and the charts will reveal the answer.....lol i begin to belive..maby cukkulito and fx51,, has studied at Area 51 Forex school

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Not that school, but I can tell you I´m an expert in Fibonacci trading and Elliot Wave. Studied for years, own some of the best software in the industry...I know about some secret Fibos, I know how to measure Fibos exactly on the price and time axis..... Let me tell you something, follow all that that I mentioned, by the book: it won´t work. The same goes for moving averages, S/R, Macd, and everything else....why do you think there´s an endless list of systems, and threads, and indicators, and, and.... MM and position sizing, specailly position sizing, have the biggest impact in your bottom line. That´s why, tossing a coin does work (it´s proven), provided you trail with enough distance...but it´s very slow. I read somewhere: the market is random, that´s a given, the second one, it trends...now: try to catch a trend...the price you will pay, with any indicator or system, usually eats up all the profits of the trend, by the time you caught it, if you were good enough to catch it. Add to that, the cheating brokers, if you don´t agree on this you need to pay more attention...just look at any chart , any kid can spot the stop hunting....and that´s only one trick...news spikes is another, some are justified to have liquidity on the other side of the table...most are just an excuse to wipe out millions and millions on SL, then run in the original direction, with all the retail money in their pockets.. Add all this togehter, and it´s easy to understand why almost everybody fails...and traders are usually on the high IQ end of the poulation... To sumarize: you need an extra edge... My tip: it has a lot to do with position sizing, and managing. Wish you the best of luck in finding it.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
A reasoned post, not that I necessarily agree with your opinions but at least you presented them in a reasonable way! I'm almost tempted to vouch for you....only almost! I guess it depends on what you mean by 'work', 'S/R, Macd, and everything else' are only there to help a trader form a directional bias , they're ancillary to trading. That, I believe, is why there is such a high failure rate, people think predicting direction accurately is prerequisite to being a profitable trader so that is what they focus all their energy on. As does the effective use of leverage, compounding, and more importantly risk management. So far no-one has come up with a viable alternative to a stop loss, ie closing a trade when it's either no longer valid or viable. In fact looking at most of the strategies suggested by those who claim they don't use a stop do in fact have a stop loss! An edge will do the job more than adequately, I'm not sure what an 'extra edge' is. Anyway, it's nice to see all the garbage posts have been removed, there was way too much noise in the thread from hecklers in the cheap seats, lol! -

--- 帖子 #876 ---
You nailed it on the head: MM and position sizing, especially position sizing, have the biggest impact in your bottom line. Been saying that for a long time.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Impact yes, both positive and negative! Your trade size is specifically designed to allow for 000's of pips drawdown, averaging, and martingaling which is why you're trading for pennies. Compared to a trade with a realistic stop and therefore a leveraged position it's hardly the best use of capital, leverage, compounding, or the market itself. You won't debate that fact because you already know you can't argue with the math, all you say is that math doesn't apply to you!

--- 帖子 #878 ---
He tried but this is still an open thread on a public forum, the challenges, observations, and suggestions continue..... It's impossible to defend the indefensible so he has very few choices available to him when it comes to trying to justify his strategy with reason and logic! Like you say none of what he says is ever substantiated.....it's all just smoke.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Hi Bob.. wouldn't you think all that without a well defined entry point might not have the best impact on the bottom line as it could?.. i was the kind of a guy that used to say entry is just a excuse to get in the market and your Trade Management is what would make the difference and I still believe it to some degree and full believe in the TM part.. but later on as i grew as a trader i learned that a well defined entry to get in accordingly well is also as important and kicks up Traders bottom line a few levels up. so its all hand in hand IMHO. just something to also think about. good luck trading all.. i be hitting the tennis court on a small tourney, be back in a few hours so if i don't respond back in time excuse me in advance you all. Hopefully we all could carry on a good intelligent none abusive exchange of concepts from here on.

Now I have evidence that lillelise is indeed a buddy of an Admin. He is protected and his troll-postings have not been deleted. That opened the way for thelws to post an unsubstantiated troll statement and it hasn´t been deleted too. This thread is thus open for trolls, the Admins have their buddies in this thread and will not look that the forum rules will be respected. Other members have told me this , I didn´t know lillelise before but they were correct about him and his special connection to twee. No place for a reasonable discussion in this thread. The only place to discuss the lock-unlock method would be a new thread where trolls like lillelise and others are banned from the beginning and where the thread starter would keep the thread troll-free because trolls like lillelise will never respect forum rules and what can you do about a troll who is protected by the Admin ? Nothing. I am not going to open a thread. Lock Unlock has been described in this thread, it is easy to understand but it is not for newbies. Everything has been said about it. I will not waste my time maintaining a thread against SL-missionaries and trolls. I am out.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Funny how the person who accuses everyone who doesn't agree with him of being a troll and claims he is the the forum's 'troll-busting' saviour is the one with the most deleted posts! lol, look how that worked out! On the contrary, we were having a very nice discussion thanks. Only in very vague terms, without specific examples, and without any (long term) substantiated results. It's really a non-strategy which needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Questions about your questionable strategy getting a bit too difficult to answer huh, I understand. Well cheerio then, thanks for stopping by......

Put the two together and you make money. Simple enough.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Then they have won.... Unfortunately your wasting your time with these guys. Who pays the wages, who advertises their product all over the forum, who controls the market that we trade in. Any decent system that can make serious money, gets nailed, especially if its a no S/L, hedge idea. Happens over and over again. It makes me wonder why some people descend on a thread like this and then fight tooth and nail to prevent other traders from finding out for themselves whether it works or not, would you bother, I wouldn't. In all honesty would you think they would continue with this if they didn't have other motives..., and as you mention, the private PM's that are floating about have all came to the same conclusion regarding certain members on here, same names crop up on various threads and only when it starts to get a little to close to for comfort with the brokers. Bet this post gets removed fairly quickly.

Compared to a trade with a realistic stop and therefore a leveraged position it's hardly the best use of capital, leverage, compounding, or the market itself. But averaging and martingale is not what we are dealing with in this thread, but hedging as opposed to SL. And the math does work, it´s a very old idea. In the end you need a positive expectancy system.Problem is systems work, then they don´t , then they work again... If you can recover most of the potentiall loosers, however you do it...even semimartingale...with a specific limit...then you get your extra edge. Math again... Mistakes play also a big role on the bottom line...one nasty mistake a month, and that could be enough to waste all your time (and $). And finally, in my humble opinion: time is the most important factor...cause it´s limited...when I look at the time axis of any chart...it´s not the time of the EURUSD or any other, it´s a graph of my time...cause maybe tomorrow I won´t be around...EURUSD most probably will.. That´s why fun is paramount...regardless...one lifetime.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
If you're talking about long/short same pair/amount (nedging) then sure the math works out, it's more expensive, that's clearly demonstrated right here in this thread. Some systems perhaps, others stand the test of time. As regards market analysis you're a Fib expert so you'll know how that performs over time, in all markets and all time frames. It's not necessarily the tools, it's the adeptness of the person using them. Recover? If you mean in the Nanningbob sense then yes, math, it's not in your favor unfortunately! It's a serious business but yes I agree, people should enjoy their trading, I know I do. Why would anyone do something they don't enjoy and which isn't productive, they may as well have a regular 9-5, at least they'd get a regular income, paid holidays, and medical!

oh mine, not to be offensive, but from what you posted, there are quite many points contradicting with each other you are quite probably just like me, a loser (of trading), hoho.

i respect and like Bob actually, been reading his threads for years. i just speak out my different opinions. on the other hand, i sometimes trade with lock-unlock only because i feel comfortable though i now know it brings only a psychological advantage. this is a fun thread, i'm happy to see we laugh at each other, and throw sarcasm at stupid comments (no matter whose). tell you what, making fun of stupid comments/actions is really a major fun of a person's life, at least to me.

Funny I just agreed with the comment made. Talk to the person who wrote it.

Yeah it's that supply and demand thing again..... (Just seen your troll spray, lol, classic! )

now after trading a few yrs, i wouldn't agree with crap comments, would i? no matter if the comments are friendly or not to me. trading is the only thing in this world NOT gray. right is right, and crap is crap. that cruchuf?'s comments, are unfortunately mostly ....... well you know......

Really, if you dont get the lot size to account size thing down you will have trouble making consistent profits, month in and month out, year in, year out. I can trade almost any type of trading system now because of this truth. I can trade with the trend, CT, and range trade successfully and profitably because of sound MM system. Nothing crap about the statement at all. And you know what, whether you agree or not doesnt change the basic truth of the sentence. You can take a successful trading system and use bad MM and turn it into a losing trading system. You can take a losing trading system and change the MM on it and turn it into a winning trading system. People told me you couldnt take a CT system and make money, long term with it. Well I did and proved it, not only by doing it myself but having other traders follow and do the same. You get the MM thing down right and you can be a consistent profitable trader. Rejection of the statement doesnt change its truth. That was the turning point of my trading profitability and consistency. MM and proper lot sizing.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
bob, i think the quote below is wrong. but it is your freedom to believe it. but there are many victim of the write-to-earn guys like V. Tharp (ur belief is his classical claim).

--- 帖子 #896 ---
I have no issue with you and if we disagree on this point, no problem. My experience was, when I toned down my lot sizes and went for a reasonable profit month by month I became successful. Every person comes to the table with different expectations in investing. I have found that buy and hold, (sell and hold) can work in Forex trading also. As you know I get roundly ridiculed for such beliefs but they have been used for centuries as an investment tool. Anyway I have work to do and need to get ready for my trading week. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Correct. A positive expectancy system can still destroy your account if you don't use appropriate MM. Even "proper MM" applied to a positive expectancy system can ruin you, but at that point you can at least say it was just bad luck . Technically incorrect, but depends on your definition of "losing trading system". If the mathematical expectancy of the system is negative, then MM cannot save it (although it can prolong the agony). This is evident to anyone who has tried to use MM to gain long term profits at roulette, or any other casino game where you bet against the house. It is possible to imagine a positive expectancy system to be a "losing system" though, if you use a loose definition.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
I can't believe you guys are talking about money and risk management as if it's some big revelation, it's one of the very first things everyone should know when they get into trading, it's pretty basic stuff! fierceman I don't think you can compare MM tactics in games like roulette to MM in retail forex trading. Casino games have a definitive beginning and end, you either win or lose a hand/spin/etc and then go on to the next hand, rinse and repeat. In forex, (although it's a totally ineffective use of capital, leverage, and effort), you can trade pennies and hold on to your hand for as long as it takes to turn into a winner, in effect meaning any strategy could be profitable. Of course the question then is what someone considers 'profitable' and a productive use of time, money, and effort!

--- 帖子 #899 ---
There are differences of course, if you want to get into details. My point was that MM will not make a negative expectancy system into a positive one. Roulette is just a simple, clear example of the futility of such thinking. Tell that to the people who bought USD/JPY at 262.00 in 1985 .

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Roulette isn't a comparable for some of the reasons stated. The futility is most of these 'recovery' strategies are a very poor use of time, money, and effort. They're designed and used by/for people who lack basic understanding and the ability to trade productively. Take the worst negative expectancy strategy in the world and with the use of some convoluted mix of averaging, martingaling, nedging, and chipping away at unrealized losses they can produce a meagre profit. Sure, for any trader they're a futile waste of time but these guys aren't traders, they're just playing at trading. Money management is crucial for these strategies to survive the drawdown, most of them are limited to trading pennies for that very reason. Even for an extreme example like that there probably would have been ways to make a few pennies or break even. Again, not worth the time and effort but it is do-able.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Right there is the gist of all these various methods. I'm of the belief that they are used by people who truly do not know how to trade in the first place and use them to eek out that meager profit. A total waste of time and energy.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Not really, just an example: trend traders would consider CT trading a losing trading system. However, with proper MM you can turn it into a profitable system. If you trade too big you can lose money and never recover, but if you break up your entrances into smaller pieces and enter the market at different spots you can make it profitable. Oh yeah, I remember we have been down that road before. Sorry to bring it up again. I already know you will reject that but it doesnt change the truth of the statement. If you know how to trend trade, range trade and CT trade then you can take any basic trading system and make it profitable with proper MM.

By the way...if you live in Central Europe...(like Germany), you could save yourself all these discussions in a year or two. SPD party is growing strong with Merkel´s failures...SPD will push the Tobin Tax (Transaction Tax) with all their might...(BS, but politically very popular). They (SPD) want to be an "active part" of our MM. Imagine trading the EURUSD on a 17 pip sprerad...You can try on a monthly or yearly chart....and if you are under 15, you might make some money for your retirement..if brother broker and the SPD didn´t wipe you out before...

--- 帖子 #904 ---
A 17 pip spread would only affect scalpers and short term traders. Those of us who trade longer term, low leverage, and low lot size would still be profitable. In the old days before computers the pip spreads used to be 50 or more. There were no scalpers then. You read the market entered it and followed the trend. According to my trading report my average trade is 4 days long. So when you come to understand and comprehend other trading methods it wont bother you so much. Not that I would like 17 pip spreads but I could still trade my same system with them and be profitable. I would just have to share some of my profits with the govt. that is all. I used to trade the AUD/NZD when it was 25 pip spread successfully when it was a great ranging pair.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Performance certainly is the measure of success, but it goes a little bit deeper than bottom line return. Averaging and martingaling strategies like Bob's et al tend to show very poor performance, and in comparison to traders it's pitiful. If you're going to trade then trade , why play at being a trader? If you don't know how to trade then learn, it's really not that difficult....

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Thanks Naning youré obviously an "old dog", (I mean this with all respect..) You give me hope... Hate taxes, and SL..

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Hate taxes but they are necessary and try to pay as little as I have to. SL same thing have to use them from time to time but only when necessary. Like the aud/usd trade I did this week. Started went about 100 pips down and then went 150 to the good. See no need to take a loss when you dont need to.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Compared to what? Are you implying that should a trader "recover" their way into profitability (let's say 100 pips profit) that that's not good enough? That by using some other technique they should have cleared, say, 150 pips? Is that the qualification of a "good" use of time, money, and effort? That's quite the crystal ball that can realize what the maximum gain should be or should have been. I think simple profitability would be enough....are we now debating degrees of profitability?!

You misunderstand. Google 'Sharpe Ratio', then maybe you'll understand a little more about 'performance' in this context.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
LOL, don't look now but you are being as dismissive as all of you are accusing Bob of being. Until you answer for yourself I'll make an ASSumption. My guess is that your statement that "recovery strategies are a very poor use of time, money, and effort" implies you think they are either not profitable at all or are profitable, yet not as profitable as if one were trading another way (presumably using a conventional SL/TP method). In the ballpark?

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Performance is not measured by profitability alone which is why I suggested some reading material for you, to help you understand. Although Sharpe Ratio can be manipulated and therefore isn't necessarily all that accurate, it should give you an idea of some of the things to take into consideration when assessing and discussing performance. On the other hand if all you're interested in is making winning trades and returning a few pennies regardless then......

--- 帖子 #914 ---
I agree with this. I know your comment was directed at someone else, but I'll join the discussion if you don't mind. I'm bored waiting on price. I believe averaging down, trading without stop loss, or martingaling are dangerous and make terrible returns (if they succeed) compared to a strategy with an edge and a stop loss. The reason being turnover rate and exponential compounding. Few lack the skill, edge, discipline or all of the above to trade succesfully with a stop loss. But those that do smoke those that don't in performance/ROI.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
So do something worthwhile and post your setups. You know where it is Be my guidance ?

--- 帖子 #916 ---
There is very little to misunderstand about you.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
I am doing something "worthwhile". Don't need to prove anything to anyone. Is it that you are looking to copy someone? Well, it's no secret that I mainly use support and resistance. I've said this on here several times before as well as on my sites. I also pay attention to news, trend and recent price action. That's pretty much it. I know many people find it impossible to believe, but you can profit with a stop loss. It's actually safer than trading without one if you can believe that also. Anyway, here's one of my setups for you... EUR/USD on 1 hour chart...

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Now I see. I was blind before I figured out that there are many different ways. Now..... I only trade what I believe to be right while I realize that not everyone else is wrong. When I know that I am always wrong (after all these years) and everyone else is right..... It's a simple picture. Paint it for yourself. 'ay?

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Absolutely, and it's surprising that some people don't seem to be able to understand the obvious benefits of one over the other.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Ok, I get what you're saying here but let's use a quick analogy...... If one were to take a long trip, flying is usually the best option. It get's you there in the least amount of time, giving you a good return for your time spent vs money invested (a'la stop-loss trading, according to the masses). But, there are people who are terrified of flying (a'la traders that just can't get the hang of SL placement, let's say) and decide to drive. It takes them longer to get there, it's not as efficient BUT THEY STILL GET THERE. They are "successful" in their journey. There is a collection of a League of Extraordinary Knuckleheads on this forum that won't acknowledge this. And let's take into account the well known statistical failure rate of traders. The most common numbers thrown about are 95% fail. Whatever the true number let's all agree it's a lot. Surely you all can realize that it's probably some type of SL method that they're using (after all that's the de facto trading standard). Doesn't the scream to all of us that there might be another (gasp!....better) way?

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Nacho, It looks like you should have about three months under your belt trading this strategy. With a good mix of ranging and trending conditions. How's it going for you?

--- 帖子 #922 ---
utter rubbish that 95% fail... if you're going to base decisions about your financial future on statistics it would be an idea to actually research them first. If you look at brokers statistics for retail traders you learn some interesting facts (this information is readily available and easy to find..) 1. the majority of retail traders with live accounts have a win loss of approx 60%, the traders with accounts over 10k have higher win rates than those on accounts of 1k. 2. of those losing money the main reason for well over 70% is losers greater than their winners, a negative risk to reward ratio. So anyone who spent some time to consider these figures would realize that trading successfully has nothing to do with having a stop loss... you're wasting your time being busy fools, sounds harsh i know, but forex is....

--- 帖子 #923 ---
I can't speak for others but my financial future (as it relates to trading) is based on my P/L statement. Not statistics.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
why quote them then as if it made some difference to your decision to trade with no SL?

--- 帖子 #925 ---
I understand what you are trying to say in your analogy, but I think it's a poor analogy to use when comparing trading with a stop loss to trading without a stop loss. What if I told you that flying to the destination had a better chance of getting there alive, say 95% chance of getting there alive (while also getting there faster). Driving to the destination may feel safer, but there is a 80% chance you will crash and be killed. Would you still drive or try to overcome your fear of flying? The thought that unrealized and realized profit/loss are the same is lost on so many people. It's incredible how many people are fooled by this. Now, that doesn't mean that trading without a stop loss can't be profitable in the long term. I've NEVER said trader X can't ultimately profit because he trades without a stop loss. What I am saying is that trader X's ROI will be much less than Trader Y's, who knows how to trade with an edge and a stop. I also believe that not only is the potential for greater return possible with a stop loss and edge, but that it is also safer in safeguarding your account from ruin. Just because one ultimately profits doesn't mean they were technically successful. When you factor in time that may not be the case, however this may be subjective according to the persons goals or objectives. Trading without a stop loss may require years for a trade to turn around and become profitable (if it doesn't get margin called). If you are a trader that makes use of leverage and positive swap, in that time you cannot predict if (or when) things may change. For instance leverage could be lowered due to regulations. Interest rates may be lowered and become negative. Your broker may even go out of business! I like to open my trades and have them close within a relatively short time frame (within the week). If I have a bad week and lose money (which happens), I feel confident going into the next week knowing I have an edge and a better chance of making it back than not. Trading without a stop loss might have meant going into the next week with drawdown and not knowing if it's going to get worse. I would be married to that trade (psychologically and with my margin) and miss other (and better) opportunities. Remember, unrealized and realized are the same. Now if I have a good week, then I can withdraw the profit (if I want to) or keep it in the account and let it compound. This way I don't have to worry about anything but my trading.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Even if that 95% number that gets thrown around was right it tells us nothing about the pros and cons of using a stop loss, because the percentage refers to all the retail traders. We don't have separate statistics for SL, no SL, EA, hedging techniques etc. However anecdotal proof seems to suggest that in fact few SL traders who also use strict money management rules blow up their accounts. Whenever I see an equity curve of someone who did that (and I saw 1-200 of those), or when I read such stories on forums, it's a pattern that suggests something else. What we generally see is people who had long strings of small wins followed by 1-2 huge losses. For example, the guy starts out with a $10,000 account, after 50 trades he is at 11,500, then all of a sudden he loses 7,000 in one day. That pattern is very typical for people who use martingale-recovery techniques, or at least keep moving their SL further away. Let's just think for a moment. If you have 10,000 and set a SL and a TP of $100 (whatever that means in pips), you would need 100 consecutive losses to lose all your money. That's very difficult to do even if you're trying to pick the worst possible entries, working hard to lose money. More than that, nobody keeps risking the same $100 per trade as the account is bleeding. That is fine for a 10,000 account but not when you're left with 2,000. If you do the math you realize that in the real world even with a completely random entry it would take thousands of trades to blow the account assuming that your position size is decent (risk no more than 1-2% per trade). While the death by a thousand cuts is certainly possible (even certain if the system has no edge), the reality is that the vast majority of people losing their accounts experience a different kind of death. They lose because: a) Their position size is too big, risking way too much per trade; b) They keep adding to losing positions and call it recovery or martingale - that can work very well for a while giving the trader a false sense of security; c) They keep moving their SL to allow for more breathing space or revenge trade and that brings us back to point a) above.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Statistics had no bearing on determining my trading style. Again, my comfort zone backed by my P/L statements determined that. I brought up these stats to try and show to the knuckleheads that, given the high failure rate of traders, the knuckleheads should at least allow for the fact that there might be alternate ways to be profitable and that may include using no SL.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Now I/'we don't have stats to prove this but anecdotely I see what your saying and if true what's so bad about being happy with your no-SL-profits even though they aren't as large as they "should" be or aren't as large a trader Joe who is diligently making use of SL? Someone somewhere is surely outperforming trader Joe....should he make revisions to try and keep pace with Super Trader? Here's where I think there's the biggest disconnect in the understanding of using no SL. WE TAKE LOSSES TOO!!!!! I would not let a trade go months/years....I'll accept I was wrong and close the trade for a loss. By not using a SL I've given the trade it's maximum "wiggle room" to came back to me. And another big misconception I see is that the pro SL crowd assumes price has to come back to the original entry point. It doesn't. If I can capture the lion's share of a 38% or 50% retrace of a move that went against me I can recover most or all of my initial position.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Ugh, I can't believe I've gone this long without bringing up position sizing. Thank you Lazy Pawn! Position sizing is key whatever side of the fence you are standing on, maybe even more so for the "recovery" crowd.

solid post brother.

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Semantics, you are in fact using a stop loss! There's nothing wrong with having a wide stop as long as your reward justifies the risk, the obvious futility would be taking several small gains and one large loss. Obvious, but that's in fact what some people do! That's just strategy, there are many variations, but what I have noticed is a growing number of people who follow these types of strategies offsetting winning trades against the unrealised loss of an open losing trade, in effect they're working to cover unrealised loss as opposed to working to make profit, it's as if they believe it's not really a loss that they're spending their profit on!

--- 帖子 #933 ---
True, there are many variations......of every trading style. The main point of contention I have with you and some of the others here is the apparent total lack of belief that a method such as Bob uses and advocates (though I have yet to see him hold a gun to someone's head and proclaim his way as the only way) works. It just plain does. And I think we're talking more than just semantics. If a position goes against two different traders, the one that used a SL (and it gets triggered) has absolutely lost that money on this trade (let's give him credit for being good enough to earn that back and more on future trades). I will let the run against me consolidate and re-enter and give myself at least the chance to break even on the retest/countertrend move. It happens and it happens often and I end up ahead on this trade . And just as I allowed for the SL trader to make money on his successive trades, I give myself the same allowance only I won't have to use some of my profits to offset my stopped out trade. To be fair, I can't trade back to break even all of the time and I'll close my initial position with a loss. BUT, I've given that original entry a fighting chance. A chance an already stopped trade doesn't get.

--- 帖子 #934 ---
We're back to square one here (Sharpe), it depends how you define 'works' and where you set the bar as far as productivity goes (time, money, effort, risk, return). If your only criteria for 'works' is a bottom line profit, any profit, then there is every chance it may work, but grossly skewing risk:reward doesn't put the odds of longevity in it's favour. Small gains for high risk, it doesn't sound good, and win:lose doesn't seem like it's going to save the day in the long run. A few of the main advantages of trading this market are liquidity, leverage, low transaction costs, and the clearly defined tradeable patterns/levels which develop. Strategies like Bobs fail to exploit most if not all of those advantages. Trading retail forex is traditionally accepted as being speculative rather than an investment. The main strategy difference is you're using a wider stop, but it's still a stop. The disadvantage you have is that if/when that stop gets hit it's going to take a whole heap of profitable trades to cover the loss because the profit on your profitable trades is so small. If you had a comparable reward then it wouldn't be so much of an issue but you don't. Ok now we're getting into a traders adeptness at market analysis, some traders don't need to let price run far before they know their analysis was wrong so they close and look for other opportunities rather than spend time, energy, focus, and money trying to force a trade to be profitable. The advantages are obvious. The other thing to take into consideration is that unrealised loss on an open trade is still a loss, it's just not realised yet. If there's any doubt about that then check your available equity. If they're honest with themselves I would hazard a guess that any of the Bob traders (even Bob himself) would much prefer to develop the necessary skills to trade in a more traditional way and be infinitely more productive rather than do what they're doing. Sure it's more comforting than being one of the failure stats but to be perfectly frank with you it's not really trading. The Bob approach to trading isn't anything new though, it's been tried in all different kinds of formats, all equally as non-productive as the other. For most people it's just a phase they go through on the journey, they eventually realise the numbers don't add up and that it doesn't really make any logical or financial sense so they move on to greener pastures....

--- 帖子 #935 ---
For ME, I'll take any consistent profit as "working". You say it's not really trading.....I'll concede there too. Given the choice of calling my self a trader or being consistently profitable, I'll take what's behind door #2 thank you. And the high risk you speak of I assume you're talking about risk of the catastrophic trade scenario but that's offset by correct position sizing. Remember, misdirected though we (non SL "traders" are ) are, the burden of correct entries with proper account risk is still at the top of the priority list. Aahhhh, but why must you assume that the profit on my profitable trades are so small?? I have my share of correct entries that turn into good runners. Don't we all? Yes, anyone can fall victim to letting a trade get away from them. Most likely they're being stubborn in their ability to admit a mistake. This affects us all, though. "Run far" is highly subjective and is a function of acceptable risk. A SL trader may set his stop at a point that would make another trader throw up and bail out. But can we rightfully say that one is wrong and the other right? You can substitute SL placement for "acceptable drawdown" and just as easily be talking about two differing non-SL traders (or market participants, if you'd rather ). Really!? Those that held firm through 2008 vs those that bailed would love to take you to task for this statement right now. I feel that would truly be a hazardous guess for the one's that are doing this profitably. And I agree that "traders" of all sorts have had to move on to (for them) greener pastures.

Some great thoughts and posts on this thread. Never let anyone disuade you from what you believe is best for you - myself included. My comments are based on my experiences. I truly wish the best for everyone here. Thank you for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #937 ---
has anyone built a risk model on these ideas?

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Ok, so you'd rather be consistently profitable than be a trader. Well that's half the equation, what about risk:reward? Only from details of the occasional trade posted. Risk seems to be in the hundreds of pips (or perhaps even unlimited, those details are conveniently omitted!), reward barely 100 pips. With that kind of risk:reward the probability of meltdown is extremely high. No. The smart money bailed and sold on before it hit the fan, others were left high and dry with no escape route. Your 'catastrophic trade scenario' played itself out and we all saw and felt the results. Ask some of those institutions whether, in retrospect, managing risk would have been a good idea. Ask some of the investors who went bust overnight whether they think they should have accepted a loss earlier on rather than hoping and praying the thing would turn around. "Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent." from A. Gary Shilling, Forbes (1993) I can't imagine anyone being content with making pennies for the rest of their time in this business. Once the novelty of not losing has worn off they'll want to get where the real money is, it's only natural.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
It's impossible to do. The strategies are vague and constantly changing to suit circumstances after the fact (ie 'I wouldn't have taken that trade because of x y z rule/indicator/circumstance, sorry I forgot to mention it before!'). Retrospective trades are always the best, unfortunately my broker is a party pooper, he doesn't allow me to trade on historical prices!

Well it seems we've reached the inevitable diminishing returns in the point/counterpoint debate. Just pretend I posted some more retorts for "my side" and I'll pretend you did the same after that and we'll each enjoy our weekend and get back to what it is we each do. To the OP, I'm still interested in how you are doing since you opened this thread. To anyone else that is having a tough go of it, don't despair, there are other ways to skin the cat! Don't let some of the negative usual suspects chase you off of trying something new. Remember, they bash only in theory....I haven't heard (though, admittedly, I may have just missed it) of any of them actually trying what they "KNOW" to be wrong. Some of us have the perspective of actually having tried both methods.

......and cue smoke The very pertinent questions still exist and it's quite odd that to date not one of your 'group' has ever answered directly, hmmm.... Nothing definitive, no long term results, no statistics, heck not even a (live) trade example. Just a bottom line 'it works', 'it's consistent', 'try it for yourself' etc etc etc, and from that we're somehow supposed to evaluate and discuss? You don't have to put your hand in the fire to know it's going to burn you! In the past before we knew any better most of us have probably tried all sorts of weird and wonderful strategies, or at least considered them as an option, but it's not rocket science to understand the pitfalls. What, you really think you've discovered some sort of groundbreaking approach that no one has ever thought of before? Oh please.....

--- 帖子 #942 ---
LOL. Okay, we shall continue. Yes, "trying it for yourself" always works best. I learned a couple of things from the cheesy Driver's Ed videos, I learned BEST and definitively by, you guessed it....doing it myself. You get a point here for catchy sound bite but a goose egg for substance. Are you in American politics? A review of my posts will tell the tale that I didn't ever think of this as groundbreaking. Simply another way.

hi, It is going fairly good, although now I have stopped entering new positions (been 10 days now not trading) because I have a few audusd longs open right now (yeah I know, bad moment to buy the aussie) so I want to reduce my floating loss before opening new trades. I know this will affect my equity curve and I'm probably not gonna make the same amount of pips I did last month since I'm stopped now, but I'm still confident abt the final outcome !

--- 帖子 #944 ---
hi 60minuteman, to reply to yr points 2. my "edge" is that I open only positions with high win probabilty (see enter rules on post #1). I agree, using very small lots does not reduce the risk, but reduces my account exposure signigicantly in terms of $$$ 3. yes, possible, I'm going through a 2 weeks lock now, but I think I can cope with it. Here I could start again with the hedging story but I think it's already clear now. I also believe in retracement that happen every time even in the biggest move up/down. Now I have a problem because my account is too small and I admit I've been greedy and opened too many trades breaking my initial rule of max 5 trades open at the same time. I ve learned from the lesson and wont break this rule again. If respected, this rule allows me to have floating losses and keep opening new positions/counterpositions.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
lol, I thought the very same thing, avoidance of answering uncomfortable questions and sidestepping real issues and concerns! Anyway I thought the hand in fire thing was a great example, you certainly haven't countered it. But is it a viable 'other way'? From the information provided it appears not. Any experienced trader, speculator, investor, businessman, financial advisor, and in fact anyone who makes any sort of deal will tell you the first thing they want to know is the risk involved, and then the potential for reward, how else would they be able to assess whether it's viable? You suggest they ignore the negatives and 'try it for themselves'? Hardly.....

Near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in the early 1900's........... Orville: Yo, Wilbur, you know that stuff Bob's been working on? He sent us that info the other day? Wilbur: Oh no....not this 'flying an airplane nonsense again'! You know my bicycle is working just fine. Orville: Yeah I know but mine isn't really doing it for me. I'd like to explore this additional method of travel. Wilbur: Explore?! You mean learn? For ourselves? Nah, I'll just wait til Bob shows me every last detail. Orville: I don't know. I mean, I respect Bob but I don't want to just completely rely on his way. We're smart. Let's go out and see what works for us. We'll know it a lot better that way. Wilbur: Won't work. Orville: How do you know? You haven't even tried it? Wilbur: Too risky. I don't need to poke a horse in the butt to know he'll kick my teeth out. Orville: 'scuse me? Wilbur: Yeah, you know....risk. Besides, you do realize we could crash and burn? Burn, I said. Fire is hot. Orville: Well of course it's risky, that's why we need to go out and practice. Learn everything ourselves so we can identify and manage the risks! I mean, Bob's nice and all, but I'm not gonna just take his word for it. Wilbur: Your crazy. If flying is so great, why are so many people riding bicycles smart guy? And have you already forgot about the fire? Until Bob comes over here in his own airplane, takes me by the hand and flies me around for a few days, I'm sticking with my bicycle, thank you. Orville: That's fine. Though I did hear Mary Jane Petersen comment on how cute you were and how sexy she thought the airplane project was. Wilbur: Well what are we waiting for!? She's definitely worth some risk!

From the 'Principles of Learning' Wiki page: The principle of exercise states that those things most often repeated are best remembered. It is the basis of drill and practice . It has been proven that students learn best and retain information longer when they have meaningful practice and repetition. The key here is that the practice must be meaningful. It is clear that practice leads to improvement only when it is followed by positive feedback. The human memory is fallible. The mind can rarely retain, evaluate, and apply new concepts or practices after a single exposure. Students do not learn complex tasks in a single session. They learn by applying what they have been told and shown. Every time practice occurs, learning continues. These include student recall, review and summary, and manual drill and physical applications. All of these serve to create learning habits. The instructor must repeat important items of subject matter at reasonable intervals , and provide opportunities for students to practice while making sure that this process is directed toward a goal . Seems there's a theme here. Note the use of words like "practice", "application", and "repetition".

A little weird but well, ok....... You can't compare something which was never attempted before to something which has been tried and tested over decades, in numerous formats, and failed. There's a classic example right here in this thread, the OP has unfortunately managed to paint himself into a corner and is stuck there until either the proverbial paint dries or the floor caves in! .....funny how you had the time and inclination to copy and paste all that irrelevant stuff but still managed to avoid some very pertinent questions! What's next in your catalogue of smoke-blowing avoidance tactics, an analogy about the Titanic maybe? Be inventive, surprise me, I'm getting bored here!

I can only assume you are talking about trading without a SL? And, if so, I can only assume you have actually traded in this manner (without SL)? Surely you are not: -on one hand asking me to provide proof of success, while on the other hand spouting off 2nd, 3rd, etc..... party knowledge that you "heard of" somebody somewhere "proving" this can't be successful. tsk, tsk Let's see. Since I hopped on this thread I believe there are 2 questions I can find that I've overlooked in my quest to keep you from dying of boredom. I don't quantify r:r in the sense of the accepted norm although I am very much aware of the risk of losing my invested capital. I position size accordingly. Now here's where I don't want to lose you but I know by my historical trading performance (ie, not what my wife's cousin told me [even though he's really good at math and knows "proper trading"]) what my entry size should be. Again....no "accepted truths". My. Own. Records. THEY tell me what my current (given my account size and current market conditions) entry size should be. Why not? It seems you were told (you still haven't admitted to even trying it for yourself) somewhere that a no-SL method is not viable and you seem to have evaluated the hell out of that advice. And don't lose sight of the fact that I'm not trying to out perform the next guy. You all get yours and I'll get mine. You earn Lambo money? Fine. I'll drive a Ford. But I'll still pay for it with money I made sitting at home in front of my computer.

With a stop, without a stop, I've tried and tested all sorts of strategies, weird, wonderful, obscure, simple, complex, heck even moon cycles for crissakes! After many journeys up the garden path I eventually conceded that maybe the gurus had it right after all, so I gave that a shot and bingo. Why try to reinvent the wheel and start with a square template anyway, especially when it's less productive. However, irrespective of whether I've tried it or not, the numbers don't stack up for a strategy which has many hundred of pips stop loss (risk) and &lt;100 pips reward. Like I've said, grossly skewing risk:reward doesn't put the odds of longevity in it's favour and win:lose doesn't seem like it's going to save the day in the long run so why even bother? Now we're getting to the crux of the matter.....how do you quantify it then? Me either, there's always someone better, but why purposely choose a strategy which has the odds of longevity against it and is less productive, it doesn't make sense. -

--- 帖子 #955 ---
So exactly WHO are the gurus? How did you decide "they" were right. In order to concede that "they" were right you admitted that you are wrong. Correct" It logically would seem then, that someone who traded outside the realm of your "gurus" is simply something that you have not yet discovered. Just as you only recently discovered the "gurus". Again, logic would seem to dictate that there is more than one way to trade successfully and I still fail to see why you can't get that through your dumb dog brain. Who has trained you so well ?? How did they do it ?? Please reveal all so that I may be the Master of the Universe (apparently)??? Brainwashing is the SECRET ??

Now we're getting to the crux of the matter..... Pipmutt, after talking to the guru's who gave you the lightbulb moment, I am intrigued as to whether it was a mindset or money management issue that turned your trading around rather than a new way of trading/looking at the markets? Just interested as this post whch I could relate to when I first started in forex was placed on the symphonie thread and perhaps is more relevant to trader failure than any thing else http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...94#post5702894 M.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
In regards to "classical" risk:reward measurements, tight risk controls, stops, etc.... here is an article on a blog by a guy who I respect as a trader... in fact, I believe he used to have a thread somewhere on this site... anyway. He conducted a pretty detailed analysis of a small data set...and while I'm sure we can all argue about the margin of error on such data, and why "this here is different".... I think one would be better served to consider the logical "endpoint" to this study. http://www.nobrainertrades.com/2010/...placement.html As most will see, in fact the TIGHTER the stop, and the greater the risk:reward ratio is... the more money one makes in the long run, at least in this study. What I do like about this little data set in particular is that there is that it demonstrates a steady, relatively smooth inverse relationship to the R:R ratio on one axis and the win rate on the other. In other words, it's not just a "fluke" that a partiuclarly tight stop and distant target pays the best... in fact there is a clear and obvious direct relationship that can be seen regardless of how one varies the targets and the stops (at least in this one example, thought I speculate other examples would demonstrate similar results) The problem with really having "no stop" is that should a position lose, at no point in time will one close it, regardless how bad the loss is. In effect, if they are ever completely wrong even 1 time during the course of their entire trading career... they no longer have a trading career. For all the "perfectionists" in the world... "perfect" is still the exclusive realm of spiritual deity's, not humans. the alternative is to risk such a tiny amount that should a currency pair lose 50%+ of it's value, that such a loss would not create any significant setback in ones trading account. Of course, if this is the case... it is doubtful one is making a return that would approach even 10% per year. Most people who trade "without a stop" actually do have a stop.... an emotionally reactive stop, that is generally terribly ineffective at actually protecting their trading capital... but they have a stop nonetheless. It's a stop for their emotions...not for their money. If anyone has any hard data showing a 12 month history of successful stop-free trading, in the spot forex market, I would be very interested to see it posted. Anecdotal only goes so far... but a sample of real data, derived from trading real money, would be something I for one would like to see. X

--- 帖子 #958 ---
i agree totally, people just can't accept losing trades, they want high win rates and as such close their winners too soon.... Nobody looks at risk models and likes to accept hard facts and figures. That's why I'm trying to reduce my win rate... because i'm looking for bigger rewards, higher r/r.... I know a will take more losers but my winners will far outweigh them... simples

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Well...hehe...i wouldn't go THAT far As for myself, I am working on a few aspects of my trading that are prerequisites before I can really dig into trade optimization, however, I have recently started to organize and classify previous trades by "setup" and then determine what stop size would have been "optimal", and how far the market went before pulling back to my entry... as well as how to optimize stop adjustment, scaling out, etc. I'm sure it'll have the effect of reducing my win rate, but i wouldn't say that's my intention... All joking aside... it should just make for more profit, and less time spent monitoring trades, so such optimization is probably something most market participants and methods would benefit from. X

--- 帖子 #960 ---
yeah... i should of said im looking to increase my r/r and im prepared for win rate to fall to achieve that... but you know what i mean...

--- 帖子 #961 ---
*a quick aside.....could someone jump in (or PM me) and let me know how to insert the name of the poster of a quote?* Thanks! I start with the a basic 3% of account and divide that into 1/8. I enter with the first 1/8 and keep the other 7 to "feed in" to the trade. Whether it's against me or going in my favor. Bob's 'recovery document' can explain the particulars. How/when the other lots get entered is rarely ever the same. It's subjective based on my interpretation of things like strength of move, nearest s/r, fibs (including extensions), etc..... As far as whatever this strategy has going against it, I think we're at the point where we'll agree to disagree forever. No? If you'll promise to pay attention this time I'll answer this. Again! It works for me. To me, something that works is "more" productive than something that doesn't. To all you successful SL traders out there, I applaud you! Bravo! Good on you! And you'll notice I haven't tried to bash your way of trading nor have I tried to "convert" anyone to my way. I'm simply trying to explain that there is another way that people are having success with. So when this OP or someone else comes along who may be taking the worst of it, they deserve something more than The Bitches chiming in with dismissive gems such as "that's dumb", "that will never work....no, no, I've never tried it but I'm certain so-and-so is lying to you that he's making it work" Really?! That's why we're all here at FF? Let's say you were asked to comment on a sandwich at a local deli that serves up 20 different sandwiches and you've tried, say, 7 of them. Five of which you didn't care for. But you haven't tried the one you're being asked about. Someone raises their hand and tells the asker that they have had the sandwich and thought it was very good. The Runts start chiming in saying that it couldn't possibly be good because 5 of their other sandwiches were not good, and until we get proof of a lab taste analysis from the guy who told you it was good, we simply refuse to believe it to be true. Oh, and then you would be so tickled at your response, you would add a bunch of these

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Not true, though. If we were to believe this, we need to stop believing in s/r. A trade that goes against you will find s/r and retrace. That presents the opportunity to recover. Maybe not recover all of the loss mind you, but definitely recover some capital. The tiny amount is only the entry. If the trade goes in my favor I'll add to it (maybe a nice 1-2-3 on a pullback). I'll agree at least there's a "jumping off" point. You'll never hear me tout "100% winners" as some do. Sometimes that initial entry was destined to leave my account. We can consider this a SL, sure. But I think the heart of the matter lies with entering without a SL and thus no defined r:r upon entry. I don't know if it's still up but Bob has/had just the thing you're looking for. Even twelve months I think.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Well Randy... the fact that you do acknowledge that sometimes you take a small loss when the trade is just not working out at all in fact completely negates this whole "no stop trading" conversation. No stop is no stop. period. Margin call i suppose. having subjective stops, or variable stops, while often ill advised, is in a completely separate category, and can possibly be involved in a viable trading approach that ends up producing a profit over time. you know, if you traded in the futures pits, you would know that these "differing catagory of orders" is complete nonsense. If you traded futures in chicago at any time in history, or trade them via your computer on the globex or cbot or cme today.... then what most believe is a "stop loss" order is something that their platform "creates" artificially. There are only market orders, and limit orders. "stop loss" orders don't exist. My point is, for the vast majority of trading history, there was no preset stop loss order. you simply stood around, knowing what price you will throw up your hands and scream at some guy across the pit that your gonna close your trade. If one didn't have the discipline or resolve to plan that trade and exit as planned, well, they filed for bankruptcy and got a different job. But a variable or mental stop, even if it allows for potential large losses on a per pip basis, can be viable depending on how risk is managed. I personally still feel what your doing is limiting...if nothing else, but by no means "doomed to fail". Keep it up, report back here in a year... I'm sure many besides myself would like to hear the result of your journey here. X P.S. as far as S/R and retracing goes... I am a huge fan of this concept, however, it's the 1% of the time that retracement doesn't occur in a reasonable price move that a "no stop" strategy will fail at. If you went long the eur/usd at 1.4195 on october 28th... your still waiting for a retracement, over 1500 pips and 8 months later. Or what about the guy who went long "on the breakout" on May 4th, 2011 at the 1.4905 price. One year and 2,400 pips later, and he's still waiting too. And 99% of trades won't be so poorly taken... but a true "no stop" strategy, given enough time will end up having at least ONE of those terrible trades... and for that trader, it will be the first and possibly only losing trade they can ever afford to take.

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Your point here does not negate the conversation. A trader who enters a position with a hard stop loses that amount should the trade go against him the amount of his stop. I don't enter with a hard stop because I anticipate price will retrace at some point (again...not return to my entry. It may never do that and I don't need it to), allowing me to recover and possibly even return back to my entry (no loss) or continue in my favor (profit!). The hard SL user, that has a stop triggered, never has this opportunity. Heck, the amount I enter upon my recovery point may go into profit enough to eradicate my entry loss (remember, my entry is small). A second possibility at profit! Or, to zero out a loss without price returning to my entry point! You don't give yourself these opportunities with a stopped-out trade. After the Oct. 28th entry, price retraced 50% from mid January to late February. Easy recovery opportunity. After the May 4th entry, price retraced roughly 70% a mere month later. Even better recovery opportunity.

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Randy... maybe you didn't catch the part of my response where I acknowledge that such an approach, while unorthodox and one I feel is ultimately limiting, can nevertheless be effective... in this statement, the implication was that I do agree with your point that what you are doing can be successful. but make no mistake about it... it is not the same as trading "without a stop". It is trading with a variable stop, that sometimes (maybe even often) creates situations that would skew the risk:reward ratio well into the realm of "risking a pound to make a penny"... but I fully acknowledge that one could generate a profit using this strategy. I don't want to denegrate this thread into an argument of semantics, or otherwise take it off topic... but maybe a real example of a story I came across will better exemplify what "trading without a stop" looks like. I heard on the radio a story about an elderly woman who was retired and worth a 7 figure sum due to her wise investments in General Motors corporate bonds. In 2008-9, when GM was in a world of hurt, and looming on the brink of bankruptcy, rather than reduce her position, or cut her losses (as the bonds were devalued due to questions of solvency and continual rating agency downgrades), she wasn't to be swayed in her faith that GM would pull through. Then, GM did the unthinkable, and filed for bankruptcy. In one fell swoop, her entire life savings and financial stability was reduced to the point where it wouldn't buy her a meal at the buffet, nevermind anything of real value. Now, THAT, right there, is "trading without a stop". your trading with a variable stop, and occassionally accepting trades that risk a great deal more than they will likely ever make. Fine... it's still not trading without a stop, and when you explained this, I immediately agreed that it is possible to generate an edge with such an approach. And as far as retracement goes... while reducing ones loss from what it could have been...the mere fact you close a position that is losing shows you do have a situational/variable/psychological stop of some sort, and that if you (or anyone) were to wait for all trades to retrace to break even over the course of a trading career...it would only take one very poorly placed trade to have that person and GM lady in the government assistance line together. X

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Nor do I want to debate semantics. All I know is that when this strategy is discussed, the naysayers come out en masse and start shouting about how trading without a SL is dangerous. It's like when 'mutt told me what I'm doing is not trading. That's more than fine with me....I'm not a trader. I'm only concerned about showing a profit and "trading" in this manner is what I've grown comfortable with. My title and the title of this strategy are secondary.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
That is also called putting all your eggs in one basket. I trade 20+ currencies, so if one goes bankrupt the rest will keep earning money. Spreading your risk is also a very traditional way of handling an investment. Here is a pic of the eur/jpy. It has had 6 major trend direction changes and one range area in the last 1.5 years. These trends will last weeks or even months at a time. If it is above the line you buy if it is below Sell. Every trade except the last one will become profitable but that one can be minimal if you also stay above the weekly open on buys and below the weekly open on sells. All you need to know is what will make it change direction or watch if price crosses the line. As long as you are above or below the line, you dont need a SL. You just wait patiently for the trade to go into profit and take the ride. It makes the whole trading process simple and basically easy to do. Low leverage and low lot size can make almost anyone a profitable trader. That is why I have such a large following. I have made it simple, easy to do, and profitable. Just have to close out the trade that is going to go the wrong way. Once you master that you can always be a successful Forex trader. I dont have to sit all day and watch a screen either. Just follow PA in the direction it is going for the week. Anyway off to work. The red arrows tell the story. Oh did I tell you my win ratio for last week was just under 80% but of course I have no edge. LOL you guys are funny.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
First off, claiming an 80% win rate doesn't do anything to support or negate whether you have an edge or not. I can show you a system that has a 98% win rate... but i'll tell you upfront that it'll cost you a lot of money over time. And I'm not sure who "you guys" are, or why you quoted my post exactly... In fact, I'm pretty sure that this is a 3 way conversation with each person not even really discussing what the other one is. I was inferring that trading without a stop, without any stop, is not a responsible way to trade, and I believe in almost all cases leaves open a door to invite unnecessary loss in, and can often jeapordize one's trading career. Turns out Randy does have some situations in which he will close a trade out that is going against him, for a very small loss (per his very small risk amounts) So, in fact he does have a stop...it just isn't preset. Neither of us were dicussing win rates, or methodology, and I said nothing about a methodology, working, not working or otherwise. And by the way, I completely agree with you regarding longer term time frame trendline breaks. I help my brother manage some of his money using weekly and monthly charts, while considering supply and demand zones for potential entry points/targets, and trendline breaks for signals to get in. We still use stops however... and after just a few months, the win rate is quite high (not sure off the top of my head, but there have only been a few trades anyway) I guess I am glad your doing well with your approach... my brother is doing well with a similar approach that I've showed him. That was never the debate. I am right now showing him how to move down to a daily chart, and take an entry to the market if the market moves back to the trendline. It's too early to say what the results will be, but risking 1% with a 40-50 pip stop as a daily candle touches a trendline that the weekly/monthly is currently riding up, and targeting 200-500 pips can provide some outstanding returns... particularly if that daily candle pulls back 3 or 4 times early on in the trend before reaching an opposing weekly/monthly supply or demand zone. Anyway Bob... not really sure where your coming from with this or why exactly you quoted my post... maybe it's just a misunderstanding on my part. If i'm missing something, please let me know so I can properly address your point. X

--- 帖子 #969 ---
I answered your statements in blue and in red. ???? You stay within the parameters I said in my post and you will have success. Dont see any difficulty with that and also why your assumptions that disaster is just waiting down the road, when I clearly showed it is not. The reason my win rate is so high is very simple. Just follow the weekly trend. Get that and you will be a successful trader. That is an edge whether you admit it or not. And yes 80% win rate is doable and successful. You just have to trade high enough charts to see what price is really doing over the next several weeks and months. Trade small, trade smart, be successful. Dont let the so called professionals brow beat you into doing something else. I heard on the radio a story about an elderly woman who was retired and worth a 7 figure sum due to her wise investments in General Motors corporate bonds. In 2008-9, when GM was in a world of hurt, and looming on the brink of bankruptcy, rather than reduce her position, or cut her losses (as the bonds were devalued due to questions of solvency and continual rating agency downgrades), she wasn't to be swayed in her faith that GM would pull through. Then, GM did the unthinkable, and filed for bankruptcy.

I was inferring that trading without a stop, without any stop, is not a responsible way to trade, and I believe in almost all cases leaves open a door to invite unnecessary loss in, and can often jeapordize one's trading career. It is an example of how you can trade without a SL, be profitable, and knowing when the run is over and get out. Getting out is the SL point. Didnt think you would be that touchy. Sorry.

Man... I knew there was a reason why I didn't register on this form for such a long time... and after 2 days, I remember why. Bob, did you even read my posts? or did you just give me some sort of "form letter" response...? I'm actually kinda wondering, because I'm going to clarify, line by line, the communication here as I see it. If it still feels after this that we are just not even talking about the same subjects...then we'll have to agree to not understand each other, and maybe we an try again in a slightly different arena sometime in the future... I don't see any blue and red. If you attached an image, forgive me, because FF site is not loading for me as it should, and I can see no avatars or images from almost anyone (already contacted them about it... we'll see) I already have success...been full time for a couple years now. also, your putting more emphasis on disaster than I intended. I believe trading without a stop is limiting (and I still do), and I believe eventual disaster is likely for most, given enough time. But I never once stated "dude, this is just a career crusher waiting for the other shoe to drop". Furthermore, I'm not even sure what post your talking about (the first one to me? some other post somewhere in the thread?) Ok...now I KNOW you didn't read what I wrote....because I spent over a paragraph going into detail on how I am helping my brother learn to invest and trade, and am using supply/demand zones on weekly/monthly chats combined with TL breaks, and the success so far is great. We do use stops mind you...but rather than state whatever you are doing is not working... I believe my bro and I do something very similar...and so far, so good. No doubt man, but it's also possible on the 5 minute charts. Check my trade explorer...i know it's new (as am I here), but it shows last week, up 9%, using stops, with over an 80% win rate, and approx 47 closed trades. I know 1 week doesn't really mean a hill of beans...and it's a good week for me, I'm usually lower than 82%... but, as I said, I do this full time and have for a while. Totally agreed, but as for the professionals browbeating... the only professional that browbeats me is myself. In fact, my burning desire to eliminate my own inconsistent results (I can make money every week for 2-3 months, only to make nothing or lose half of it back for the following 8 weeks...etc.) I had a rock solid 2011, and suddenly this year old habits are back. I'm up for the year in my primary account, but it's a far cry short of what I can do. And starting a public journal here is one tool I am using to find and plug "leaks" in my game. Anyway... ya. so, either you didn't read my posts, or i didn't get a very important image attachement. At any rate... feel free to respond here, and please correct me if I am somehow even more confused than I currently believe myself to be. X

Bob...I see the blue and red now... sorry, we really are crossing wires here. posts arn't loading properly in some cases for me, and the grapics and attachements are a complete clusterf*** on my end. I think we pretty much agree here tho... and I'll post it. just wanted to PM you before we create some sort of conflictual situation over a forexfactory technical issue (at least primarily) X

I have no problem with you or your examples, just gave an example how you can trade without fear and trade without a SL. Just stay on the correct side of the line and you wont have any problems. It can be simple and profitable. Buy and hold strategies can work in Forex also.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
lol, well after all the back and forth it turns out that no-one here is actually trading without a stop loss after all, classic! Performance is the measure of how successful a strategy is......

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Why don't you just trade how you want and stop arguing about stops... you shouldn't have to prove a system to anyone just trade it for fucks sake. That being said +rep to nanningbob his system has made me some cash but i don't trade it anymore

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Why not?

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Finally! Ok not so revolutionary and not as bad as I thought, at least you're adding to winners as well, and using a stop loss. The whole thing isn't actually a million miles away from more traditional methods of trade and risk management albeit slightly convoluted and dare I say it less productive! Right, so now it's only a matter of how successful someone aspires to be, some people are happy for a while just not to be losing any more. Who knows, six or twelve months on from here once that novelty has worn off you'll tighten the whole thing up and be doing pretty much the same as any other consistently profitable trader who takes advantage of the benefits offered by this market.....or maybe not, I guess only time will tell.....

Hi Pipmutt, thanks for the reply earlier although now the post has been removed for some reason, I can relate exactly to what you were saying. You mention that most still have a stoploss of some description or other. I use a pending order ( again its been done to death) however I do use a stoploss but only for money management calculations, but not for closing a trade. If my method gives me the signal to trade I use a money management spreadsheet to work out lot size. Nothing new in that, however the s/l figure has to be inputted into the calculator to get the lotsize, I place a pending order though not a s/l after taking the trade. If another trade on a fresh pair comes in with the first trade still running, for lotsize calculation I input the first trade into my spreadsheet as though it was a loss. The spreadsheet then number crunch's a lower lotsize so reducing the risk for the new trade whilst allowing the original to run. If trade 1 then hits T/P I can choose to add to the 2nd trade at a suitable position or place normal lot size for trade 3 and so on. M.

Hey M Yes I edited it and then it disappeared, lol, the forum's been doing some weird shit lately or maybe it's just me..... Me too, same odds really as they all turn into market orders at the time of execution, I suspect SL and TP attached to a trade ticket is a platform feature for simplicity and user friendliness (or for the conspiracy theorists among us perhaps there's something more sinister behind it! ). Excellent and it sounds very versatile, a useful tool to have.

Hi This system won't work. I tried it on Oanda 's Demo acc. On American Oanda there is no leverage on Gold and Silver, therefore I made 5k demo acc just for Silver on 1:1. Silver was around 32$ then. Quite quick I made 300 Pounds on it, and then price went down. As I was sure nothing will happen on 1:1 I was waiting till the price will go up, and sooner or later it has to. Recently I took a look at this account: of 5k invested on beginning I had 4,7k, I checked what happened AND THERE WAS MARIGIN CLOSEOUT. Another thing: imagine yourself that you invested in gold at its peak around 1950 per oz. How long will it take to get to that level again? maybe a week, maybe 10 years. So the system may work few times and then will eventually fail.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
"system"... man, I know it works for some... but to me, that's a 4 letter word. "method" I find is better. I know more than a few full time successful traders that have a trading "method"...but I hardly know of any with a successful "system"... maybe I just need to get out more tho. X

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Actually you missunderstoond the "system", for me no SL strategy only works if you open another position while waiting for the 1st position reach it's TP. I often open many position in same direction or opposite direction based on the result of the first position, and this strategy really works, the only thing that you really need to watch out is leverage u use to open position. I recommend 1:1 for each position u open.

Successfully closed my last position which was floating in the loss - it took me 2 months to close it but eventually i ended in profit. I was long on AUDUSD at 1.0350 2months ago and it went all the way down to 0.96, which is a pretty big floating loss in terms of pips, but due to my tiny positions it was sustainable for me in terms of money and now that aussie is on the rise again i was able to cash in green pips on this trade + a good load of positive rollover.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
Good job at staying patient, Nacho!

--- 帖子 #989 ---
mental stops can be just as good, I assume you are reversing the trade or close a buy position if it goes under the ma? I noticed you didn't post for a while, is your strategy still working for you or did you stop it?

Hi,nacho Is ur strategy still working out? I've been offline 4 awhile and i havent been up-to-date with ur thread so hows the strategy going? Making positive pips?

--- 帖子 #991 ---
I had read this thread a few times and the first 20 - 30 pages..i had also read previous 'dead' threads about trading using no Sl some having success some do not. Some of these traders baffled me about their methodology which they gave some clues about their method but i constantly failed to reach any conclusions about it. As i tested it demo since 2009 you will have several weeks or months of winning after that you will get the big loss. Mine was such it was big loss that it eliminated most of the profit. I also considered other of using no sl will get you wiped out. So i changed gears and i switch to having a good Risk : reward Ratio 1:2 minimum. I had gained some money on the demo then here comes the sideways market. 10 consecutive losing streak wasnt uncommon. I questioned myself , how do i regained this losses. I didnt recover the losses obviously. Then i tested FA analysis, complex macro analysis and ended up confused. Then tested many TA methods some winning some losing...but always ended up -ve in the end. But i will not learn anything if i had profits all the time. I like loosing since i learned a lot more than winning. I also learned a lot myself. Then i read somewhere that trading must suit your personality. Im a horrible trader everytime i trade it will shoot for the SL no matter playing with fading the SR or playing breakout. In the meantime i heard more success stories from the No sl players and the SL player both can be profitable, but why i couldnt get there? Something is definitely wrong. I remember on another demo account i was heavy on long EURUSD and then there was a huge long term DT i shorted more ,ended in -ve overall. I sought to replicate that. I always tried to incorporate SL into my trading but always ended wrong ,either it is too small you get stopped too often &lt; 50 or too gigantic of SL &gt; 200. I realised i need a healthy balance no matter what method i used. It is suprising in this forum there were so few people talking about proper SL. I searched for SL and ADR indicator and it took a while to find it. The best was ADR since it will notify me about the current range . To me its important to not get stopped out prematurely and get stopped when the trend really changed to i could prevent further losses. I liked to overtrade , i dunno why. I dislike getting stopped out often, hated it when the price when to your favor after stopping you out. I also hated big lossestoo. A trader also said that if you have 20 -30 pip SL you will get killed as your trade need room to breathe. I wonder how people with 1:3 or even 1:10 make their trades without stopped out frequently. I also read about stop hunting which maybe is bread &amp; butter for some MM. i know they wont hunt small fish like us but what is odds that your sl is near or the same of people that MM is hunting? Even when EURUSD is trending they will bound to be fluctuations above 50 pips before moving with the trend. So i kicked all the FA / TA and started again with simple rules, buy when up sell when down. I used some winning traders SS to guide how they trade then traded on demo based on it. Added some MA to see trend direction on H4 , and adding to winners . I had a big SL for every trade based on ADR, If the daily range is 100 i put my SL even bigger like 150 or 200. So my tp for every trade is 30 or 40 based on ADR. Its like a grid...when the sideway market showed up i get both buy and sells top and down onEURUSD. Its feels weird that the tp got taken out when the sideways market is prolonged since it go up then down again. I also traded on 15 min for daily consumption or counter trend. But the H4 trade is main driver. All trades 0.01 lot no exception. Then the equity when up , i dont take note of the balance.Hmm must be doing some thing right. When the trend came it was booking in profits faster so i dont have many trades open. The worst was when i have 10 trades open but few of these is stupids trades that didnt follow the method. Still the equity when up.Sure the Sl is hit one or two but the equity is up. I thought this wont last long then traded another method which eats up the account. The account statement looks like garbage /mess i wont post it here. Even i got a headache looking at it so its hard to analyse previos trades. Few weeks ago i tradedusing the method again and the equity is slowly coming up.Now with the current strong trend the account is going up faster. The risk reward is horrible On average Risk 5 : Reward 1 . I had seen some ppl trading successfully using risk:reward 3:1 but they are good at cherry picking trades. The know somuchabout the market structure ,sentiment,trends, cycle and the overall market. SOme even using orderflow. I had headaches studying all of that, i like simplicity. If you had to consider 10 -30 factor before making a trade im out of there. Complicated analysis is killing the brain. SOme even say KISS. I will try to make it simpler gradually. I will also try to have smaller SL so my R:R is not that bad but if this produce streaks of Sl i will stick with those gigantic SL. The bad thing is i have to monitor it constantly ,if the market moves then guaranteed i have some orders up or down.If this is the price to pay for profitibilty then so be it,since i enjoy trading.. LOL. If i have some break or holiday i will make sure that i have SL so i wont blow everything when im not around. Now i knew there will be 'holes' in this strategy but this is what im looking for in FF ,hole finding then improving. The pros : 1)Surviving during sideway market even with little profit 2) Thriving when strongly trending 3) Less SL hits 4) You do have SL even when hedging even when your gridding after 20 pips 5) H4 for long term and 15min for short term, one slow and steady, another to satisfy the greed in me 6) Some times the 15min helped a lot during sideways since the TP is hit frequently bringing the equity up faster The cons: 1) maybe there is no edge after all? 2) Need some babysitting especially closing everything when equity is up when satisfied 3) Horrible R:R is this good or bad? 4) Need to adjust grid spacing depends on market 5) Pants Shittan when power/ internet goes down 6) Sleep irregulan 7) Stress inducan (even in demo , LOL) 8) Market gappan, slippan, broker pissan Any holes? TQ Also thanks for many traders on FF since they give you some information 'gold' in snippet if they didnt comment here i wouldnt have even conjure this pitiful method PS . I also like to sabotage my own demo account to see if i can bring the account up again. I like to purposely leave a bad trade open...no wonder the account never reached +ve LOL

Hi Nacho, What I really am very very interested to know is, where can on open an unleveraged forex account with OK spread (like max. 30-40pips per trade and not a few hundred pips)??? Thank you so much for a tip. Best regards, Kitty

Hey Nacho, I was wondering if you still trading this system

Lot of suckers here then. How do you hedge exactly? When to enter and exit the hedge position?

--- 帖子 #996 ---
can someone explain how to use this properly?

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Please suggest what to do in this situation? how to close hedged position without accumulation of DD as price will return after reversal or we dont know even price will return or not? what could have been done to avoid this situation? Margin level: 1300% and equity is 150 Balance is 2270$ and PNL is -2100$

--- 帖子 #998 ---
What is this? Back I have had the same and I was long long long time in the pair. I reduced it by closing one long and one short, if both are in profit. Why you have no short in the upper chart? Before margin call come you must have a balance of short and long trades. Heavy, hope you came out and do never again such a thing. Why you increased size? If you focus the double profit and one risk, you can have under 50 % hit rate and you are in profit. Let trades running and bad trades loosing. That is true self destruction and your chart is a warning, if you can not handle this, so forget it. Learn to read a chart naked, focus on money management and prepare your personality to live with loosing trades. Sorry. Search now for short trades, so you have no in the near. If you have done it, hope you done it with a system, reduce the short and one long if both in profit and if it make sense for the short. Bring the maximum out of the short now.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Simple, close a buy trade and a sell trade, if both in profit. So your margin level is nearly untouched. Do it so long if you have most trades reduced and if you can live with the loss. Another option is to increase capital and trade from now on, with a clear system. Cut loss if you have made enough profit, that you came out at break even or a loss you are fine with. How many lot have used for each side? Better you have the same on every side.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
i dont want to add funds,i cant add funds,i have to manage with this. if i will close buy trades and what if the price reverses? buy trades are very small lots,so closing buy will not help.buy and sell both are 2 lots each.so it is locked.thanks for assisting.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
My English is not good. I was in same situation, margin call near. I open opposite trades to have margin for building new trades. I closed fast as possible one sell and one buy trade at same time. Both are was green. In the end I was with small positive out of all after closing the rest. This cost me more as one year to recover this nonsense and learned that lesson for sure. What means locked? Can you not enter new trades? If I take your picture, I would fast search for a short opportunity., if you have more buy lots in the run. Keep it balanced and decrease running trades to the point you accept the overall loss or wait for nearly break even. And never again make such a mess.
