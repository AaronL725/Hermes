I was going to post this on the thread by EURUSDD, but for some odd reason he has locked it. In any event, there are a lot of things going on over there, but one of the great things to come out of it was the similarity principle. The idea is to find zones of dissimilarity that can act as targets for price to go towards. There is apparently a lot of mathematics behind it. The other thread uses two stochs set up to be similar 99% of the time, so that when they become dissonant, a zone is marked on that bar. After doing a bit of research on a slow Friday night, I remembered two indicators that were designed to mark the weakening and possible reversal of a trend. This happens when the indicators become dissonant. Their slopes literally are pointing in opposite directions. The are the standard RSI and the Composite Index. The Composite Index was formed by Connie Brown to mark areas of weakness when the RSI could not respond and vice versa. For the sake of discussion I will call it the CI. The formula is in the public domain. At any rate, I was lucky enough to find a pair that had just formed a dissimilarity bar. I also marked another place where a dissimilarity zone was created on this chart. Now for the system. After a DZ is formed, we wait for price to move away from it. It needs to move far enough away for price to breach the BB, a semaphor and zigzag must also have formed. The original similarity thread has gone deep into theory, so I thought I would use a piece of that theory and create a system for everyone to test. The rules are not in stone. So everyone is welcome to contribute. The idea for this thread is to have clear, concise rules. Coders and testers are welcome, of course. These indicators are similar 99% of the time, so when they become dissonant, it is something to watch. Here is the first chart. Joe

Hi Joe, great work Subscribed

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thanks Shiva, I'm trying to get enough vouches to post on the thread, so I thought I would start with some the ideas here. We will need price to get going on Sunday to really kick things off, though.

Indicators and template

--- 帖子 #5 ---
You got mine

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Jmn, thanks for starting this. I have subscribed and down loaded your templates and very pleased to find 'everyone is welcome'.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hello Jmn Thank you for start this treat. Bülent.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Joe I continue to find the concept extremely interesting, subscribed. Hope to learn and contribute where I can.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi jmn5611, The template file ( !similarity.tpl ) provided by you is different one...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi there! You got my attention. Will follow this. Hopefully you wont kick everybody out at page 236.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
jmn - I like the visual colour approach of the RSI. How do you do that? or is there an indi for it?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
fractal differences, kind of common sense, must be some kind level where big money is active

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I am one of the exiles with interest in the thread, so I will try to help. I'm slowly understanding more about the system, I have developed an algorithm in matlab and when I made 15 operations, all successful. I think EURUSDD taught us to look at the market differently and for that I thank you. I read that also teaches math, I would like to share with the knowledge of this field. The treaty algorithm based on an algorithm of pattern classification, only instead of classifying patterns candles, because I classified areas of similarity. I have to relate more to increase the odds tf as the pair EURUSDD is persistent and therefore closely related in all tf. The same concept could be applied to other markets if you are persistent therefore continue investigating but in this line.

Whats the difference in the fractals Juhanimi? I cannot seem to tell from your image. Can you explain further? Thanks

--- 帖子 #15 ---

you get the picture

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I thought Im the only one who got locked ( block) from EURUSDD thread. I've been testing on my demo. It turn out well. Will share my view on this thread. See my journal as I only trade EURJPY. Subscribed.........

--- 帖子 #18 ---
JMN5611 - thank you for doing this.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Liking your attitude, keep going!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Had build enough confidence with the system and trading it in real account now instead on demo. Typical approach in taking the trade. Example from yesterday EJ trade based on 60M TF. MT4 is the set up. Market scope is the real account entry. My template attached

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Juhamini, great to see you here. Thanks for the charts, gives me a clearer idea what to look for with fractals, coupled with volume.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Lirbig, lovely clear template and work on the RSI. I can already see some DS on Eurusd using it. Looking forward to getting some time to trade next week with these new tools. I see you use 40 with the RSI on the hourly, it seems to work on other TF too.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Im really glad to hear you seem to have found something that works for you! Please continue explaining your method and im looking forward to see more charts from you in the future!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Reason I don't use MT4 to trade I've read a lot on this broker here http://www.forexpeacearmy.com/public...epperstone.com Trying demo with their platform. I'm disappointed by lack of credible in executing my SL. I use "love EA" as trade manager for TP &amp; TP. This trade just got suspended, without any solution. imagine if it is a REAL account ???? Watch out when you deal with brokers.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi all, Hey Lirbig, would you mind explaining (hopefully with pictures) your reason to enter where you did. I have read many things regarding this similarity idea from the threads but for some reason just can't get why you entered where you did. And obviously great results so far, I hope it keeps up for you. jt

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Lirbig Nubee I'm agree with Juicyt Step by step,pleaseeee....

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thanks to all who want to continue this very interesting discussion. So, what is similarity? What does it represent? What are these so called black holes? Well from what I can see, which is not very much, using indicators to spot the black holes has to do with momentum. Or better yet, uniform price flow. I think dissimilarity begins when uniform price flow ends. So price has to go back there to correct that "error" Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks! Hopefully I can continue to add some quality content.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I don't use MT4 to trade with either, just the charting. MT4 is too inflexible for my taste.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
As i said way back on the other thread, this system (algorithm) appears to have many facets - supply and demand and regression to the mean.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
No code, just draw rectangles. Not my idea either, I got it from Brapp, who was exploring the ideas of Connie Brown before he vanished into the bermuda triangle!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I think that Vlad was kicking around trading just to the middle of the BB. I like that if there is a DZ up there above the 24MA. I think you are onto something with supply and demand. This is what drive trading at the end of the day. When a DZ occurs, that is a point where there was a lapse in demand/supply. So traders will test that zone again to see if it is legit. That is how we can make money. Price moves away from the DZ far enough to get the sema, and the ZZ, and is outside the BB. Kind of like rubber band trades.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I think what makes EURUSDD is to use all tf and see the similarities, in the moment you begin to produce similarities begin to obtain possible nodes, each time with more accuracy using "force" check price over those points

--- 帖子 #34 ---
jmn hi! thanks for starting this thread. Hope to understand more. I have question. What made you decide about the two DS candles? I can see some DS candles between the two you have drawn.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
juhanimi, Kindly please explain more about your chart. I think we are talking about DS candles. KIndly please point out where is in your chart? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Maybe this is a start, feel free to tell me I'm talking rubbish if I have understood wrongly. Here is my chart set up for monday (Lirbig's template, thanks) , I found some zones on the 30 min eurusd and have put red lines as potential targets. The zones are created by xixi's indicator, pink are disimilarity zones created by 'big money entering market' as explained by Baillie Post# 849 and we were told to trade back to the price where the zone started, to trade when disimilarity ends rather than during it as this is the safest option. (I presume the 'big money ' is taking a breather then and waiting for price to get back to the spot they traded before although this concept seems far too simplicist to me.) That actually means trading the green zones back to the start of the pink. I want to try Jmn's system with this idea as he/she has started this thread and I haven't waited for the extra criteria before....below "Now for the system. After a DZ is formed, we wait for price to move away from it. It needs to move far enough away for price to breach the BB, a semaphor and zigzag must also have formed. The original similarity thread has gone deep into theory, so I thought I would use a piece of that theory and create a system for everyone to test. The rules are not in stone. So everyone is welcome to contribute. The idea for this thread is to have clear, concise rules. Coders and testers are welcome, of course. "

Think GPS system operation. The GPS continuously send and receive radio signals from satellites. If we have a satellite the accuracy will be bad, if we have two satellites, the accuracy will improve because we get the intersection of two lines that give us a point. If we have 3 satellites obtain the intersection of three straight and will therefore have greater accuracy. The more lines we have, the more accurately we get. Because the functions and time dependent, I think the points will be given by a value and the corresponding time (t) in order to make the representation in the chart. Of course there are other methods that can compensate for achieving greater precision movement.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
In your chart example, where do you supposed to trade? buy or sell?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi jmn5611, Thank you for starting your own thread giving a new twist to the Similarity concept. And I thank you again for giving the indicators and template. The template you gave doesn't match with your chart. Hope, you will have a look in to it. May be I am wrong. Roy

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Please post a pic so I can see what errors I may have made.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Jmn, Can you pls recheck your template, I got stoch indicator instead of RSI and CI, later i added these indicator manually.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
BTW, you can all call me Joe. That is easier to type than jmn5611.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Putting my normal traders hat on, rather than the similarity one, I can see negative divergence on the RSI so under the normal ideas for trading I would be looking to sell but that little green zone above could attract like a black hole then we could get the fall after. If I got straight into a trade from this point on the chart I know I would close half at the red lines. HOWEVER Jmn says It needs to move far enough away for price to breach the BB, a semaphor and zigzag must also have formed. So that may imply shorting at the top red line and vice versa?????

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Yes, please post a pic so I can see what I missed.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Maybe. This is why price action is so important. DZ zones are dynamic and depend on price action. Tomorrow we can see where I was right and where I messed up, and we can sharpen the concept.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Please understand that I am a learner just like all of you here. I am not the Guru. I will never be a Guru. I will always be a learner. I am just putting out ideas. If I am wrong, I can learn from you just as you can from me.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi jmn5611, Attached is the chart using the template given. Roy

--- 帖子 #48 ---
You also have to download the indicators.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
This what it looks like.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Okie dokie, I really messed that up badly!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
This is after downloading the indicators.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I think I forgot to save the most recent template. If the template does not look like post one, then I messed up. That is why I waited till the weekend to do this. I am forgetful.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Try it now.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Joe, It is O.K. now. Thanks. Roy

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Joe, It's interesting to see you open another thread for us "students" of similarity to discuss and learn more about it. That's a good idea!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Well, we got locked out. I never got a chance to post my ideas. You are a coder, and if you can contribute in any way, feel free. If I get 1,000,000 vouchers, I will never lock this thread. Like the people's Pope, who I believe is the greatest Pope in my lifetime, I would like to be a thread for anyone to come and contribute. Any way they feel like it, as long as we can be in a general direction. Just my tiny grain of sand in the ocean.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Yes, correct. If you look at price action, though, those prior zones have been taken out. If the high or low of a zone get taken out, that zone goes away, because price has corrected it. If a zone is more than two weeks old, it "expires"

--- 帖子 #58 ---
This is what next week is for. Finding DZ and watching how price acts. This is not a mechanical system. We have to look at price action, relative to other DZ and see how it acts. I would like to see price move away from a DZ to the point where we get the sema, the zigzag, and price is above or below the BB. Then I would place a trade to target the most recent DZ with a stop below or above the last swing. Of course, your own money management rules apply.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Xixi, great to see you here! I like your indicator as it shows the start and trade out of the pink zone, only leaving the remaining untraded zone in green, but why do you think Ralome's was further adapted by Eurusdd into rv1 and rv2? Why didn't he use yours? I needed to try out the two rv1 and rv2 so i had to switch back. Did you produce a rv2 equivalent as it would be very useful?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yes, sounds like we are on same wavelength. Off out now but thanks again Jim, think we needed this to explore ideas further. I had spent a week trying to figure the Sim system out just to be locked out just when getting somewhere and no more questions/opinions allowed unless already on the right level. So this is great and I hope vlady joins us!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
well, I see you guys are talking about the indicators, some even based on the "sim/dis-sim zones" indicator to trade but as Eurusdd said it's just about 60% correct. Do you believe on something with 60% probability of correction or something which derives from that 60%? I'm not. So what I wonder is how to find "true" sim/dis-sim zones. That takes me come back to the fundamental concept: similarity. As Joe has just posted: So, What is similarity/dis-similarity? Why? When? How? I think if we can't find the clear and correct answers for those questions first then we just based on "wrong" understanding of the principle. So I hope to see elaboration on those questions as I read the threads many times but I think I still haven't understood those concepts at its deepest. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I wish to present some whiskey-induced thoughts here. (Might be offensive to elephants and other large mammals, chihuahuas not included) What is true nature of price? If no one manipulates it, price tends to go to zero. Similarity is equilibrium and dissimilarity is the anomaly. Price always tends to reach an equilibrium whereas the market participants tend to disrupt this to profit from the anomaly. . Our job is to find the relative 'zero' towards which price will gravitate after the anomaly is resolved.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
There is a 10+V invisible member reading here and I bet my gonads that its our Guru EURUSDD

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi taypot, Thanks for your interest in my indicator. Basically my indicator and Ralome's has no difference. Ralome is the originator, I just modified his indicator a little bit to suit my style. Here you go. I've just modified the code a bit so now you could switch back and forth between rv2 equivalent and the latest one.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
My 2 cents.... Why is it so important to find the "Black Hole"? I know that this is of the utmost importance as the price is supposed to return there........ But lets face it, if you are as mathematically challenged as I am then it will forever be lost.....LOL Fact is that just trading eurusdd original introductory method with the CI,ZZ and BB or BB,ZZ and Stoch is more than enough for me.... This is what I am currently developing....

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Xixi, The indicator's formula is correct. The 60% figure he seems to be referring to, must be the other TF's that are not being analyzed.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Black Holes = Potential Targets, CI, zz, bb, stoch = entries.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
It appears that a person needs NASA,s SGI Super-computer to find this Black Hole. Like I said I am content to trade the dis.... on the indicators....both ways...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
great thread jmn5611 !, would you share your RSI indicator with the colored background zones please?, thank you

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Post a link to the EURUSDD thread.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Well, I think many of us want to know exactly what it is. EURUSDD said that there are many ways to find it, or at least an approximation of it. The cycle indicator is horrendously unstable. I personally wanted something that will not repaint. The stoch method is one of many ways to find it. I hope that next week you post your trades. I am hopeful that a lot of people post their trades. I do not believe in just one road for this concept. As long as your indicator set up is according to the rules that the charts must be similar 90% of the time, when it becomes dissimilar, that should be a price point of interest. I am no math genius either, but I do not think you have to be. I think we have to understand what the anomaly is, after we get that, we can reverse engineer our way to pointing it out on our charts.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks for your work xixi

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Karish, the colored zones are hand drawn. Use the rectangle tool.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
He should be pleased that he inspired his very own independent classroom!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
GVC, it seems you understand the strategy very well. KIndly please post your chart examples with caption pointing your entry and target? Thats is the only thing I need to understand at first. I think. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
What is really nice with Joe that we don't find elsewhere ? He was banned from another thread, so he could ban people from this other thread. But he did not. For me this is a more valuable voucher

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thank u Joe... Subscribed..

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Xixi, thanks for the indicator. When I run this through the MT4 strategy tester, this looks amazing. Does it run the same in real time? jt

--- 帖子 #79 ---
add this, then maybe you can see dis-similarity thing http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...68#post3747868

--- 帖子 #80 ---
maybe some coding needed here with fractals-&gt; show only when 2 or more are on the same side cleaner charts

--- 帖子 #81 ---
much better

--- 帖子 #82 ---
That looks interesting! Do the fractals repaint much? If not, your "double fractals" indicator could be great for determining short term trend changes in the longer trend!??

--- 帖子 #83 ---
yes, and looks like real SR-levels in future too no they do not repaint

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Yes that 1.3302 line looks like really strong S/R. I must dig into this later and see how they line up with the zones etc.! How did you get the fractal indicator to only show double fractals? Would you like to share the indicator?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
editing picture with paint, no indi, maybe someone here can do that? i believe that is fractal dimension with higher math?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yes it would be awesome if someone could make one!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
also in stoch-bb-zz method, stoch 24-1-1 looks much better than 300-1-1, so everything else is 24 period and stoch 300, i do not understand that

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Fractals will re-paint if it doesn't have to its 5bar set up.... Its formed by two previous candles a top/bottom and then another two lower/higher before it a confirm fractal.... Just be carefully because until the 5 candles confirm the top or bottom it's normally too late.... Would add chart but not a home! Good luck

--- 帖子 #89 ---
not late when used in future sr-levels, let price come to you said our master

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Juhanimi, definitely worth checking out.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
i use stoch and bb for years with set stoch 72-1-1 and bb 18 in every TF. it's work for me.. lol Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello Joe and Fellow Similarity Students, Firstly thank you to Joe (jmn5611) for starting this discussion thread. I personally think that the separation of the threads is practically important so that (a) original authors can post their own thoughts without having their thread turn into a fully fledged classrom and (b) for followers of various skills, experience and knowledge of the topic to learn from each other. Having all these posts in one room is just unmanageable. So Joe, thank you for your initiative. Now only 5 pages in, I see the same questions popping up from the Main thread as to "what" and "why" we are doing what we are doing. I've been thinking about this all weekend and the simplest way I can describe it is that: SIMILARITY = constant trending momentum on all timeframes. DISSIMILARITY = a change or disruption to that time frame in one or more timeframes. When we are trending a strong bull market that lasts for months.... you would generally find that we have more up days and a few retracement days. But after a strong bull trend and a crash is imminent, that change doesn't occur on the 5M or 15M... it has to occur on all timeframes. This change in trend isn't a synchronised event across all traders and investors. Some will have more knowledge than others. Some may be instigating the change. If trades were put in that disrupted the flow of the underlying trend - then we are sure to see a blimp in the smoothness of the price trend. Therefore the mysterious black hole - is nothing more than identifying an arbitrage moment or opportunity from price. And the mathematics behind it (I'm not a a mathematician at all) is "similar" no pun... to something else I do understand called sympathetic resonance. If an object (eg. price) is resonating, it will affect other instrumentation that resonates at the same frequency. The moment that it doesn't - you will be able to detect it, which signifies a CHANGE. So I think some of the people here are starting to cotton on to the fractal nature of similarity. I think that is the way forward. You can use any instrumentation of price... as long as the scale on the graph is made to be the same across all timeframes... then you will be able to spot a dissimilarity.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Great idea to open a thread for the "similarity - students" and people who aren't allowed to post in Eurusdd' s great thread but also want to figure out a system with a clear approach . Thanks Joe. Hope we can develop and find interesting things and views to similarity here too. Will post my view about similarity and things I noticed soon. see you guys on Monday!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I agree vlady. One could use the price itself for the detection of similarities?, Without any indicator.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
eu daily

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Great explanation! Thank you! Would give you a vouch for that, if I could.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Someone told me this many many years ago. But he was a programmer / mathematician... funny how that is. I don't know how to implement this. The practical problem is that a charting software instantly defines the timeframe you are watching. The concept of looking at the last 300 bars then creates an indicator anomaly. You need to something to read all timeframe data at the same time.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Let's expand this a bit more. WHAT IS PRICE? For MT4... price is a discrete value.... but actually.... on a charting software. "PRICE" is actually a co-ordinate. X/Y.... x is a nominal value against time. TIME then is your problem. Because Time is relative.... but it defines the price HISTORY. So really.... Dissimilarity is a disruption in the flow of historical trend. Maybe we are wrong... we have to find a way to flatten price into one index to allocate to price? Will dissimilarities at the 5M ripple up into one big dissimilarity in the 30M or 1H?? These are the ideas I am wrestling with at the moment.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I agree, so whatever we use, do we need to see dissimilarity from the top down, or from the bottom up? Connie Brown says we should look for indicator anomalies from the Month down to your trading frame. So if you see dissimilarity from on the monthly, weekly, daily, and finally hourly time frame we should pull the trigger. Do you agree or would you look from M1 up?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I need two more vouches before I can vouch for others. Believe me, I have a list

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I think you can evaluate all tf while the code is just longer, but as you evaluate one tf, can assess all. It takes all the values ​​of all tf prices and from there, noting the expression indicating the similarity and point out the mathematical expression to indicate the similarity. The problem perhaps is that we must be constantly downloading data to evaluate whether or not similarity. Of course we know in advance that EURUSD is persistent in all tf as a track that has been used EURUSDD is that all tf.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Great question. I've had numerous traders say to me Top Down, ie. Month &gt; Week &gt; Day &gt; 4H &gt; 1H &gt; 15M &gt; 5M &gt; 1M. That covers all bases I think. Even from a non-SM point of view, if you were a 1M scalper... wouldn't you want to know that the entire week has been an UP move and therefore your scalp targets are all going to be Longish? I know some people use different combinations as well... eg. Day &gt; 4H &gt; 2H &gt; 1H or 1H &gt; 30M &gt; 15M &gt; 5M Doesn't really matter. What if for example, Eurusd was bull for 6 months then we got a DS on the current month....wouldn't that impact on every other timeframe eventually? And sooner rather than later?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
+1 Done!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Working on your really interesting fractal idea Juhanimi with xixi's indicator (THANKS! Xixi). Any thoughts on this EURUSD 4 hr? Blue/orange rectangles, inserted by me, show double fractals (orange are a group of 4 ) Pink zones are dis zones created by indicator and they appear before/mark a major change in trend

--- 帖子 #105 ---
The use of indicators may delay the answer, but we must also take into account that using small tf prices may bring more noise

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Is that an indicator drawing those arrows?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Here's Xixi's new indicator on the 4H

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Thanks Vlady!

--- 帖子 #109 ---
hi vlady, good to see you here, its just the fractals indicator (Bill Williams, already presnt in MT4 indicators). I have never used it so keen to understand what Juhanimi is showing us. From what I can on the chart see those double fractals could imply a change of trend a good percentage of the time.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
That's true, so top down would be the more logical choice. As the zones become tighter with the smaller timeframes we will eventually get to a very small window as the price target for our next trade.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
The coders might already be working on this, but it appears what we need is MTF DZ indicator. Something we can put in the corner of the chart and as zones light up we can see it. Do you think that is doable xixi?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Kiads, although we can see your position, can you mark on the picture and/or explain your entry? Thanks, jt

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I still think that the data should be suitable platforms for mt4, do not make optimal load and reduces the probability of success

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Quote: THE SIMILARITY PRINCIPLE!!! Let X(n) be a random/pseudo-random process that satisfies - certain well-defined conditions (known as the fractal-conditions). Let F and G be functions that satisfy the Black-conditions and agree almost surely on the set {X(n)| n&gt;0}. Then the set of values on which F and G do not agree is a predictor of the process. One has to construct F and G , continuously as the process evolves or use the back-door approach to extend F and G . This is the hardest part!!! If you can construct good candidates for F &amp; G , then you are close!!! ------------------------------------ -------- ​This principle is good and applicable to forex-trading. The price-process of EURUSD satisfies 8/10 of the fractal-conditions! You need to find indicators F &amp; G that can read all time frames one one time frame.

Your describing Point and figure/Renko charts. Since these charts do not require Time, its ideal for identifying Support/Resistance.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I like to trade in the direction of the Renko if I can as I read once that renko candles continue in same direction 79 % of time. I have attached the PRT charts I was using to trade from last week before i came across the similarity thread. It shows the Renko chart that I keep in front of me. Note the upward trend since 9th July and the fib retracement numbers. Sometimes I trade against it but I am careful.

I think there's no difference between testing environment and realtime.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I'm not sure. MTF maybe a part of the system but nobody know what correct formula is except Eurusdd.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I don't think there is a "correct" formula. We are looking at concepts. EURUSDD has built himself a way to define DZ in the manner to his liking. I am thinking there is more than one way to do this. The anomaly we are looking for is in price flow. That signifies change. When price goes back to similarity, that signifies continuation. When the market goes back to change, it is going to head for the last DZ. That is the theory anyways, to my limited mind.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Do you mean MTF DZ indicator is similar with the indicator at the corner in the chart which will let we know at the moment we are in a sim or dis-sim zone on other TFs? I think such an indicator is code-able.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I think what we need to do is to find dissimilarity at the same time on all time frames(5min, 15min, 1H, 4H, 8H, 1D). We first find what stoch setting on the 15mins will correspond or give the same value as the stoch on the 1hr TF and what 1hr setting will correspond to the 4hr TF. If all the TFs are all in sync then dissimilarity should appear at the same.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Yes, exactly. If we can see sim/dissim zones in that way, we can analyse charts in a glance, and be confident when we take the trades towards the target.

--- 帖子 #125 ---

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Yep, the thinktank seems to be on the same page. The coders are working on something I think. Until they finish, us mortals will have to do it by hand. Again, there is more than one way, so if you have a way to get there, feel free to contribute.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
That's great! Now according to EURUSDD that makes for a great target. If I misstep, let me know.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I think he said it's better to trade away from it, for our level of experience. What i know is that the zone acts as support/ resistance.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
btw xixi, as soon I get my fourth vouch, you will most certainly get your seventh. Thank you for being the coder on this thread that is speaking up and participating. I have noticed that every good thread here at FF has at least one good coder, who turns ideas into indicators. The original thread has Ralome, and we have you, so again, thank you very much!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Okay, my understanding was that price will return to the DZ to correct the "error". This thread is a democracy, so we can do it both ways and see what works!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
For the chart i posted above, 300 Stoch on 15mins is equivalent to 75 stoch on the 1hr TF so we need to find the values for other TFs.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
You are correct. But the the thing is, we don't know when. There are zones that have not been taken out for more than one week, i think they also have lifespan.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
What I'm figuring out for a MTF DS indicator is similar with the current one but it could display zones of other timeframes as well on the same chart. I think it could be more useful to help us see the zones in history, not just at a moment as the "corner" indicator.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Okay, great! The more tools the better!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks Madmoney! Feel free to post and let us know how we are doing over here. I think we have come quite far, and the market has not even opened yet. That is the true power of positive collaboration.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
we're here to share and contribute as our own ways so that we all benefit. I'll try to code the indicator and let you guys know.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Great thread keep up the good wrk guys!!! I am currently testing many things and will share once finished.... you get my vouch mate

--- 帖子 #138 ---
They have a 14 day lifespan. After that, the probability of them being viable targets falls off the cliff, according to EURUSDD. There is something like a 90% probability that they will be taken out within 14 days. Even if we do not know when, if we follow the rules we have set for ourselves so far, our R/R ratio should put us in a good place.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thanks josh! We are definitely on the trail now.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
This may help with converting indy settings to different timeframes.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
In my view, you find your base timeframe, which is the one you will be trading from, and multiply or divide for the other TF. So if you are using 300 on M15, H1 on is 75, H4 is 18.75.....uh oh, do you think that maybe we need to find a number that will divide without a remainder on the upper time frames? Fractals should not have a remainder.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Sweet....let's see how it works!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I am currently working on using the BBZZ to detrmine tops and bottoms.... Fact: [highlight=rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)]According to Bollinger, the bands should contain 88-89% of price action, which makes a move outside the bands significant. [/highlight] If you go back on your charts once PRICE or 1EMA hits or closes outside BB and ZZ it will always come back in... Many time it moves from top to bottom of the BB giving us good targets!! What I am currently testing is entry points to confirm tops or bottom....

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I'm having problem with the H4 as well. I just downloaded fmsfx .xls file let's see what that gives us.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Also here is an MTF fractal indicator to play around with, you might find something...... Fractals are a relatively new area of development in mathematics which provides us with an interesting way of looking at what appears to be random chaos and breaking it down to a well structured formula .

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Agreed, that is one of the reason I started reading the original thread. Somebody had an understanding of probability. I saw that Vlad had suggested that instead of targeting the actual DZ, when price does come into the bands, maybe we should only target the 24 MA. What are your thoughts about that?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Great Madmoney, thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
This is an option but for me the entry is more important... I use other indictors that I have used for years like the average price bars which once in a trade it can help you manage your exit! Because through back testing if you exit at the 24ma it will give you a profit but if you have the top/bottom which is what I am looking for you will cut your profit short!! Still testing at the moment but looks very good

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Sometime simple is key. Look for instances when price bounced. What were the indicators saying and where did the bounce occur?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I agree about price coming back in to BB. Its too dangerous taking entry at what you believe is the top when price is outside the BB. Price often continues away in that direction and stops you out. It would be great to be able to wait for price to come back into BB and take entry there, BEFORE we get to middle band. Have anyone tried hedging for example? Wait for price to get back inside BB and place one pending order at the top/bottom BB and one on the middle? There is a lot to try out regarding the stoch/bb/zz method.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
stoch 24, eu m15, kind of clear picture?

--- 帖子 #152 ---
2 clear dissim things and in both case, price comes back straight away, no waiting for many weeks

--- 帖子 #153 ---
That seemed a buy signal. What about sell signal? Thanks

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I grapple with that as well. Hopefully your testing will bring some insight. In the meanwhile we are armed and at the ready! It appears there will be a good amount of forward testing going on, I am looking forward to that.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Well, the worst we will ever have to wait is 14 days. After that, the DZ is invalidated.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Yes sir, I learned that a few years back. DO NOT trade if price is outside of the bands! It could be a runaway train!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Could you post the template?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks for starting this thread. Here is something I was working on before getting locked out. I have been working on 2 strategies that came from different ideas that were presented which I think show some promise: Strategy 1 Stoch goes outside band EMA goes outside same band ZZ Top or Bottom forms Enter trade SL = 10 pips TP is middle band Strategy 2 Stoch goes outside band EMA goes outside same band ZZ Top or Bottom forms Price crosses mid band enter trade SL is opposite band (top band if a short, lower band if a long) TP is next ZZ top or bottom I posted a PIC showing results since July 22 nd : The light blue vertical lines represent where conditions for strategy 1 were met to enter the trade. I didn't mark strategy 2, but you can see where the mid band was crossed afterwards: Strategy 1 15 trades. 10 wins, 5 losses 119 pips Strategy 2 11 trades, 10 wins 1 loss 195 pips In real time live results would likely have been a little different, but both strategies have merit. What I wanted to do next is work on an EA to test both strategies. That way different settings can be tested, optimized and then a walk forward analysis to see if this is ready for live trading. I am not the greatest programmer, so this may take a while because doing the stoch of the BB is a bitch. If someone else wants to step in that would be great.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Looking forward to you testing this in real time here next week!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Spot on with Strategy 1 Dewey. It is a high probability trade if the Stoch reaches the 0 or 100 level with your conditions in strat 1.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Yes, and tie it in with the period after a DZ forms in order to test the system Jmn proposed in post 1!!! We have a plan. Quoting Jmn Now for the system. After a DZ is formed, we wait for price to move away from it. It needs to move far enough away for price to breach the BB, a semaphor and zigzag must also have formed. The original similarity thread has gone deep into theory, so I thought I would use a piece of that theory and create a system for everyone to test. The rules are not in stone. So everyone is welcome to contribute. The idea for this thread is to have clear, concise rules. Coders and testers are welcome, of course. Quoting Dewey Strategy 1 Stoch goes outside band, EMA goes outside same band , ZZ Top or Bottom forms , Enter trade , SL = 10 pips , TP is middle band

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I have marked an example on the picture below. That is not a dissimilarity, but one of eurusdd methods on his indicator thread..... The real sweet trade is on the bottom left of the picture. A dissimilarity with the Stoch almost on 0 and all the other conditions....

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I actually find it easier to trade away from the "unborn" zones than finding the right spot for entry when price wants to go back and close a zone. Done some good trades in simulator today and I really find the Stoch/BB/ZZ method combined with the zones indicator very promising! This is actually the first time I have been able to expect where price is going rather than hoping/guessing. However, I have a long way to go. Have to manage my entries better, with right S/L and T/P strategies. What im currently testing is Stoch/BB/ZZ with dis-similarity combined on the H1 chart. Will post charts as I demo-trade it live and we will se how it goes!

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Nothing for me to post yet, price has returned to similarity, but is still inside the DZ. I need to take a nap, so when I wake up, I will post what I see. If I missed a trade, I will post that also. I am still waiting for FF to give me vouch privileges so I can thank the folks on here who have expanded my knowledge. I will use the vouches responsibly as the rules state.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hey Dewey, Thanks for a clear outline but you must take note of the following I think: Your analysis and your win/loss ratio is based on the history of your charts. This looks great on historical charts yet the problem is identifying these anomalies and applying it in real time when price is actually outside of the BB. For example your first strategy was suggested as this: Stoch goes outside band EMA goes outside same band ZZ Top or Bottom forms Enter trade Yet in real time it looks like this (and this is what we are trying to solve using the similarity principle): Stoch goes outside band ( and could go further ) = problem #1 EMA goes outside same band ( and could go further ) = problem #2 ZZ Top or Bottom forms ( but as this indicator repaints, it cannot be considered a real top or bottom unless confirmed by the principles of similarity using the stoch/bb/zz method developed and still being investigated by vlady and others from the old thread and this one was well) = problem #3 Enter trade ( you would be entering on nothing more than price and the ema being outside the Bollinger bands in which case we are not entering the market with any correlation of similarity, thus making this entry void on the porinciples of simlarity.)

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I wasn't expecting to take any trades in the Asian session, but when I pulled up my chart this was right here in front of me. Since it is a demo I decided to go for it, even if my entry was a tad late. I also clicked the close trade just before it hit the middle band--trigger finger but you get the idea.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thanks Dewey Now we got your point...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Ok thanks Xixi, I hope that is right and I am watching the charts as we speak.. Is it an option that we can make this indicator for other pairs and/or other time frames? jt

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Well defined!! How do we overcome the issues then? To me we are just entering based on indicators..even with the sim principles. Its is mentioned that even with sim principle, accuracy is only 97%. So I won't bother with the perfect entry I focus on placing sensible stops. I won't say I can solve the issues but for myself I mitigate them using the zones as S/R.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Your points are well taken and this strategy is by no means a proven one at this point. The idea came from the Similarity thread and I simply felt it is worth exploring further. A couple points though—if you use the ZigZagN indicator you can see where the ZigZag indicator painted to help with visual back testing. Also, the idea of only taking the trade when you have confirmation from both the BB of the stoch and the ZigZag should help reduce the runners which kill any BB-only strategies. What I have observed, albeit from a small sample, is that you can use a small stop loss (10 pips) and still have mostly winners which will average being higher than most of the losers. What I would like to do is to code an EA for this as mentioned so I can back test it over a longer period of time, then optimize and do a walk forward analysis to see if it is really worth running live. My coding skills are very limited so if I do this on my own it may take a while. I might try this on the Zorro platform first because it is easier and the testing phase is much faster as well, then transfer over to Mt4. In the meantime, I will also try this on demo since forward testing is best anyways. I have done a few weeks chosen at random on a trade simulator with decent results. The sample is too small to say this is a great strategy yet but I think it warrants further testing. Will using Ralome's similarity indicator make it more viable? I don't know yet. At this point I wanted to test this further

--- 帖子 #171 ---
So strategy tester and live aren't at this stage looking the same. See the red and green dots/bars which are the targets on pic 1? (strategy tester) bu nothing on live chart no. 2. http://i43.tinypic.com/ou8jv7.png http://i40.tinypic.com/2pzjzig.png

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You can use it for any pairs or timeframes if you like but you must find the optimal parameters. Eurusdd said parameters we are using is optimal for EU M15 only.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Looks like there's another indicator included when you run strategy tester. The red and green dots are not from StochDifZoneX indicator.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I deleted everything and ran it and those dots/lines still appear in the tester. As you can see, nothing else there.... Help! http://i42.tinypic.com/555ekn.png

--- 帖子 #175 ---
ok, so it seems my mt4 has decided to put those dots/lines there as it knows the future. All indicators deleted and there they are, appearing all over the place. http://i43.tinypic.com/116pa1f.png

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Metcalfe, sorry for late reply here my template and also u need that 3 custom indicators for complete setting the rest are standard indicators.. pass for #Signal_Bars_v10a ff : free_at_ff hope it helps Kiads.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi Bro, I am in. Thanks for starting it.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Yes, that really correct. i use 2 bb (high and low) to reduce that problem..

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Joe, or anybody who already know.. why 14 days.. could you explained the logic behind please ?. and counting from when/where ? because different broker time zone will give us different set of data especially on H4 above.. and if we want to know when that 'big boys' enter or exit the market i believe that we must 'see' similar price data with them ( base on 0 gmt maybe..,) so we must use indicators that capable to make time shift adjustment.. and we will 'see' same sim-disim zone when we discuss about that..

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Note that you're using Ralome's indicator, not mine.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi, I was thinking of strategy 1 too. Looks full of promisses. Use the mean and extremum points. Then i go back to the definition of the bollinger bands and i swap my interpretation : IF the price makes almost tops and bottoms outside the bollinger bands in accordance with the deviation parameter, THIS IS BECAUSE the price now is almost a gaussian function around its moving average mean, SO THAT it i use the bollinger bands, it seems we are trading the NOISE of the market. So, the next question was : is it good to trade the "noise" or to remove it ? When we have dissimilarity, this "noise" is completly distorded and we don't have alternating high and lows anymore. Fractals indicator shows mutiple tops or bottoms, ZigZag repaints its extremum, stock makes multiple '100s' or '0s'.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Interesting! Would you like to explain that or maybe show a chart how it looks and how you use that method?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Exactly what i am looking at actually, but i think this is trading the noise and actually the market is swinging rather than trending. This is not "a practical approach to similarity", even this is great work.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I found better to enter at the mean of the bollinger band and exit at the extremum : - Not sensitive to runaway at extremums : VERY GOOD. - you ask or bid at an "average" price so you have a good chance the price will go at least away from its average - works during ranging AND trending markets : VERY GOOD Then for the direction of the price, i choose the alternation principle (after a top, a bottom. And vice versa). So the idea is good only 97% of time because when we have dissimilarities, this alternation process is not working there. 97% of the time ??? No, because the noise is distorded by news, market openings and closings, etc... But for me this is trading the "noise" and don't know if its better to trade it or to remove it...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
There was/is a thread here based more or less on that principle.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Good morning guys, With the BBZZ "method", let's not try and analyse it to the point of optimisation. If you were to do that, you'd need the complete DS Framework which we don't. At best it is a method - a flawed but useful method of applying an observation by Eurusdd. The "similarity principle" being applied here is that PRICE = STOCH. McG's 2 strategies are a reflection of where we were on the other thread at the time we were debating the things we are discussing now : Repainting of ZZ. Essentially, the 2 strategies are a) OUTSIDE TOWARDS INSIDE : trade it from the extreme going in b) INSIDE TOWARDS OUT : trade it from the BB towards extreme. ---- Someone made the comment that the stoch needs to be at extreme ends of its measurement spectrum. Correct! If its scale is say 100 to 70 and it values at 85 AND is outside the BB.... I would say it's a week signal. If it's at 70-75 and outside BB (ie a ZZBOT) it's more powerful. Reverse for the other side. ---- Just because a ZZTOP/BOT appears on a 5M.... doesn't mean it's a signal to trade. If it resolves to a 15M signal, yes - potential trade setup (now look for your own entry signal). At this point, I don't have a full blown method that is shareable because everyone is different! Where do you stop? Some of you may know that I am trying to figure out a Daily Direction method.... I can tell you this relies on ZZ, BB, Price/Stoch and 2 extra indicators that haven't been talked about as much. That's it. Small sample size (4 days... 3 correct so far), but the results have surprised me. What this leads me to believe is that the resolution should start from the highest to the lowest timeframe you are comfortable trading in. Eurusdd never explained why he uses 4500 minutes or 300 bars of 15M. But the 300 has also been used in his version 2 DS Zone indicator.... which he said could be applied multi-timeframe. So he is basically saying 300 unites of time is enough. The 14 days of expiry - he turned into 35. I don't know why but just be aware of these. So let's not try and "automate" the BBZZ method just yet.... let's continue to debate it. But I hope we don't dumb it down to the point that just because you can't write an EA for it - we mentally discard it or create the impression that the principle isn't "systemis-able" Peace! Out!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Good morning guys. Here I post my thoughts / views and approach to work with sim (similarity) and dissim (dissimilarity) zones. It may be a little different from the rest here. I do not use MT4. As tools I use only BB and stochs. The zones you see are hand drawn. sim zone = Price outside BB (close) and Stoch outside BB. As my zone I mark the first retrace candle. The zones are the grey boxes! dissim zone = Stoch outside BB but Price NOT outside or Price outside and Stoch not. As my zone I also mark the first retrace candle. The zones are the blue boxes! Clearing of zones: For Upper zone (Price and Stoch above BB) we need a close above and a close under to clear it! / On the downside we need close under and a close over the zone! The zones with a frame aren't cleared till now. You can see how the zones act as S/R too when price breaks the bb on the downside. Hope this helps to have another view to sim/dissim. More later. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #189 ---
okey, first, ci is like 100% correct with dissim thing we do not need to know why dissim happens, we can use it anyway even if we don`t understand it me thinks, that there is 2 kind of dissim things, but we don`t need what they are we can use them anyway why Eurusdd is talking like he is talking, well, people has difficulties to keep secrets, because every one wants to be a hero, and in this case, all info is all ready given, he is trying to make chaos, because he feels bad, that he could not keep mouth shut, and trying to correct that mistake with chaos one question: you can trade dissim with ci in m1 and m5 and get many signals every day, wtf is this stoch 300, why should you wait for weeks when you get many signals every day fractal dimension with higher math is nothing else than dissim with fractal indi, normal thing for fractals is zigzag, dissim is there where this fails this is my analysis about this thing these levels was created in weekend from double fractals, eu-m5

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Very interesting, do you think that the main function is that PRICE = STOCH?. This must be studied from all tf from highest to lowest?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
it is a holy grail when all is put together, when you have everything in it

--- 帖子 #192 ---
then the first part serious PRICE = STOCH to produce similarity PRICE STOCH than would have dis-similarity. This I would have to do for all tf. If we PRICE = tf STOCH in 1day and PRICE STOCH than in TF 4H, that means it is producing a change in trend, but lower tf guess the dis-similarity has already been produced not?. something more is needed to predict the turning point.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi mate something I thought I would share with you.... If you look at the first three hours from london open you will see that most of the time the hi or low of the day is set.... So if we can identify either the hi or low of the day we can trade away either to set targets or ATR.... HOD= High of day LOD= Low of the day

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Like EURUSDD said it took him 5 years to put all together.........a long time.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
For the BBZZ method yes. The Bollinger Band is set to 24 periods. So the DS Time Unit is 300 and the Bollinger Time is 24 ie. Price is Price Stoch is 300 units of price (can someone mathematical or technical elaborate on this?) or setting of 300,1,1 Bollinger is 24. I believe on the other thread, someone explained that the dissimilarity occurs when LL or HH enter the 300 time unit zone and basically disrupts the "averaged" result of the period. Continued trending results in DS until it stops. That DS "value" is then persisted?? over 24 units of time in a Bollinger Band to give you the extremes in that visual aid. Something like that. So if you change the TIMEFRAME, you are in effect changing the number of bars you are representing on the MT4 screen. My own questions: Is it possible to overlay all the timeframes together in one screen and then zoom out so you have 300 bars of the highest timeframe? 300 months is different to 300 weeks / days / etc. So what is the ideal or practical timeframe? 4500 minutes is the equivalent of the 300 x 15M unit that we all use. Translated, that is 3.125 days. Is this a magic number to anyone? Pi?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
you just have to read what he writes, everything is there question: how long have you been trading this? EU: demo 2003, live 2004 he is 27, so... now is 2013, it was then years ago when he was demo trading, he was 17, so... it took 5 years to make this thing... 2003 - 5 years=1998-2000 or something...how old was he when he started to build this up.....12-13 years old, okey, maybe, or maybe not

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Has anyone considered simple divergence when price and stoch are out of kilter?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
On the 1H... we have a ZZTOP. It's in the middle of the BB, so it's not valid. It's not resolved so we should expect a higher ZZTOP. (This is one of the main reasons I am calling for an UP DAY today - see other thread). Therefore by inference, all other lower timeframes needs to catch up to this dissimilarity.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Good morning traders! As far as my part in the experiment, I marked the DZ on H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then went down to M5 to find the trade, there was one when price was just above the zone with the following entry criteria met: 1. Price moved above band 2. zigzag 3. Semafor 4. Bearish price action candle. Price then went on to take out this zone. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Perhaps this will spur further thought.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
i looked that friday with stoch 8-3-3 when i had stoch 24-1-1 in use in eu m15, looks good to trade towards dissim

--- 帖子 #202 ---
The difficulty here is "what is a Day"? On your charts, some of the LODs are not..low of the day, but Low of the London TF that you are watching.... not saying you're wrong but the definition of your timeframe will influence your triggers. Eg. 25th of July, that spike up/down was broken topside for the real high of the day. How would you trade that? I remember that day. I predicted UP. So really.... you're London open timeframe isn't a day... but perhaps Franfurt + London.... 6 hour timeframe?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
What does 8,3,3 actually mean...Besides the 8 periods?

hello vlady,base on what u did your daily forecast on EU for up day?can u explaine please? thanks Eitan.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Not yet. Need a sample size of 5 trading days. I may make this 8 as I started last Wed. So I will give the full explanation next Sun/Monday. But I have mentioned that I use only the Similarity measurements provided by Eurusdd... nothing extra: no MACD, candlestick, RSI, blah blah, nothing. He said, everything is on the chart: ZZ BB PRICE BB STOCH EMA Thats it.

You're good Matt. It's actually great that you're doing it manually. If I had more time I would do it manually as well as you get the nuances that computers remove from the human perspective. Keep it up! EDIT: Here's a challenge: If you stick to the 5M &gt; 15M &gt; 1H (3 TFs only). Trade in the direction opposite to the ZZ signal that is fully resolved on all timeframes. Hint - the 1H ZZTOP is a fake b/c it is in the middle of the bollinger band... therefore it will repaint with higher target &gt; look towards the shape of the Bollinger to give you options of where price could be. I think it's around 1.3309. Got (demo) SELL LIMIT at 3316.

yes bro this is my style too..

When is Sydney open? Is that 2 hrs + from HK open? Perhaps someone can provide a matrix? I guess this is key of Time dictates the number of analysis units LOL.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
8 is the moving average of periods 3 is the smoothing average of the 8 period moving average( this is the first line plotted) The other 3 is for the second line, which a three period average of the first line.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I understand what you are saying but you need to look deeper..... from london open the hi or the low of the day from that point will be set in the first three hours!! Back test and you might just find something.... Good luck

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Where is your location relative to GMT?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks Josh, I'll take a deeper look and think about what you're saying. There's definitely something in it.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
its 3 hours before HK

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I am in London. We're on British summertime (BST) as well. So, GMT now is 9.52am, BST is 10.52am

Vlady very good reflections and explanations. the best must file tf similarity and dis-similarity should be monthly. I think that is what is most persistent and thus containing higher Hurst exponent. If you remember, the first templates that were also published monthly EURUSDD. to develop the equations necessary the expression of stoch, and introduce optimal parameters. I think it's possible but put it all together and superimpose different mt4 platform. I have worked with MATLAB and you may do this. Begin to appear important concepts for the principle of similarity. Obstantes not think you need something else to predict. By using the value of stochastic noise is to eliminate price, so I think the price is represented by EMA1 equality. The answer is still delayed because the points of intersection will know later. So I think the system is EURUSDD DELAY prediction equations such points: these equations may be differential or regressions if they approach a straight line.

OK,sydney open at 10pm your time zone,HK open at 1am your time zone UK OPEN...well u know i guess and US open at 1pm your time zone wish u G/L hope i helpping here.. Eitan

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I have no maths background but I do think I understand what you're saying. I agree, Eurusdd has set EMA1 as price equality. Theferfore, he is also equating this with Stoch equality IF setting is 300,1,1. But what is ONE MONTH? We had some people have difficulty defining time when you go higher than 15M. I have a feeling there is another equivalent "resonant" time to 300 of the 15M tf. 600? 900? Let's go with 900 900 x 15M = 13500 minutes. = 225 hours = 9.375 days. Do we include the Sunday open as part of Monday or separate?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Sydney should open at 8am their time which is 11pm your time.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi Vlady, if u use my market time indicator from my post here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...27#post6851827 maybe more easier to find out the starting of the day.. most of people set beginning of the day from Auckland then Sydney.. etc. but smaller group think that the day 'start' from where the 'biggest money' in the market came from.. and that is Frankfurt/ London.. market. then goes to New York, then Auckland, Sydney and HK / Tokyo.. most of trend direction changes appear at euro / american market time not at Asian market time.. even for AUDJPY.. lol.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I think for fractal purity we have to include Sunday in the equation. So the week is from Sunday Sydney open to Friday New York Close. Is there a number that divides evenly through all time frames for that time period?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Closed one of my Euro longs for 16pips!!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I guess a month tf the maximum value obtained Hurst, price cycles are closely related and tf be the most responsive to this method, this does not mean that the other tf not served, but they have lower Hurst exponents and explain less price movement. Tf are used to accommodate shorter trading for small traders. Older tf require more money to cope with price swings. Yes I think tf 15 min is also very optimal for trading. But my question now is: Considering we have two optimal tf eg f5 min and tf one months, we can find a few moments before the node that will be played in TF15 min?? I think so, hence that EURUSDD minutes before approaching a node, shares its strength

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Juhanim, I'm wondering and trying to understand, have you hand drawn the pink zones on your chart? Are they based on dissim with fractal indi that you mention?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
he is now on DST mode so 10PM his time zone its Sydney open.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
If you remember, we took two graphics EURUSDD r-r-v1 and v2, we compared two tf them and one of them was the possibility that an area previously appeared in the other graph. This mismatch occurs because the f5 min gives more accurate information than TF15 min. In this gap and knowing the node that will be touched can risk a lot because there are many chances of success

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Im guessing you took entry at the bullish candle before BB middle band at around 1.3271? I was looking at taking entry above the middle BB, but hesitated as there a zone above. And the zone has rejected price before. There is very strong resistance around 1.3292.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Would it be good if the stochdif indicators said in which way the ema and stoch are dissimilar? Just looking at the ema-stoch sometimes it appears the dissimilarity goes from stoch high to stoch low during the same dissimilarity period (relative to the ema), but I can't be sure. Maybe it's a step in the direction to creating the signals in these pictures http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...6&amp;d=1373286368 (bottom arrows are moments of similarity?) http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...2&amp;d=1372758098 If that's the correct thing to do, then we also need to combine all the TFs into it.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Thanks for the correction.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi Vlady, I tried a lot of different stoch settings. EURUSDD gave us the settings 300/1/1 for the 15 min and this works best for all longer time frames. I only chanche settings for smaller timeframe 5min. Here I use 900 /1/1. I know we look at different time periods if we doesn't change the stoch settings in the higher timeframes but to convert it down makes no sense I think. For example you should use then Stoch 18/1/1 for the 4H and Stoch 3/1/1 for the Daily. This doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Beside similarity, one have to look at other element in PA. Eg S &amp; R , bounce area etc. Entering position in Demo Account.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Yes that is where I entered I close one base on PA and will hold one at BE till I see a reversal... I think we will break 1.3292! we will see... GL

--- 帖子 #237 ---
yes, by hand, just showing, that what Eurusdd said is true, price respects those levels when trend turns

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes, trading-wise I agree... but if you start throwing in these other elements it will confuse the understanding. DS/SM is about dynamic S/R created out of something we are still trying to understand. If we throw in Fibs, Demand/Supply Zones, Pivots, Gann, Trendlines, True Trendlines we will have a mess of a recipe.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
As we are now 3 hrs in from London Open can we put high at 1.32931 and low at 1.32657 (in fact LH and LL than Fri)

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Here's a rule I discovered with another fellow Similarity poster.... apologies, can't remember who! For the template with PRICE/BB and STOCH/BB and the DS Zone Identifier at the bottom..... Important: you must have these 3 windows panes. Window 1: PRICE - normal timeframe setting. EMA = 1, Bollinger 24. All timeframes Window 2: STOCH - CAN ADJUST TO YOUR TIMEFRAME .... so 5M = 900,1,1 / 1H = 75,1,1 Window 3: DS Indicator = DO NOT TOUCH SETTING of 300 periods, 24 periods.... this should work on all timeframes. Can't remember the post but I think it should be on Post #1 of the thread where Eurusdd updated it with an amended Ralome indicator (v2).

--- 帖子 #241 ---
We need higher. Zones are being cleared on the 1M, 5M, 15M, 30M and 4H! Direction UP. LOL EDIT: 15M semafor/ZZ just printed HI... but it's not complete. It's in the BB. No COBB (Close Outside BB).

--- 帖子 #242 ---
LOL....Its already higher!!!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
This is what im looking for right now: I would like to se price go up and close the zone and confirm a ZZ and SMA1 above BB. (Blue ring) But price is struggling with resistance at this level (Yellow rectangles). So if we break it we might go even higher!? Hmm, I might be far away from the truth here, but this is how I try to learn, by observing and watching what happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #244 ---
We're on the same page. But don't forget to look at other timeframes for the zones. 4H has almost the same zone and we are close to clearing it. See my post above... if you keep the same settings and flick between the tfs, you should see some zones close to being cleared. BTW... I am using both v1 and v2 of the Ralome Indicator on the same "page" applied to separate instances of the same timeframe.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Perhaps we get some interesting zones by comparing two differe Attached Image (click to enlarge) nt stoch settings. One with the 300 settings and the other with the converted settings (here 75 for the 1H) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Im also experimenting with same stoch period (300) on the stochdifzones! But im not using V1/V2 right now. Think I should. Do you use 300,24 on both V1 and V2? Wasn't we supposed to use 300,8 on V2? cant remember how to set it up correctly.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Out my 2nd long for 23pips.... Currently short, watching 1.3270

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Just bought on demo, 5 mins disim started, bounce off 300 ma. stoch 20 Other MA lines and arrows to do with another system so ignore

--- 帖子 #249 ---
You're right actually. v2 uses 300 and 6

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Quick 10 pips from 2 x double fractals (blue boxes) forming an area of resistance (yellow line). Set a sell limit, 4 pip draw down. Juhanimi, the double fractal was posing a fairly strong level of resistance, maybe coincidence, maybe not, forward testing and time will tell. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Edit - Entry could have been better, if I waited for ZZ BB. Only demo, just playing with the concept, but thought I'd share.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
It would be helpful if you could explain what you are doing Lirbig Nubee. As already mentioned, I and others don't know why you entered. jt

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Yes, if you use xixi's new indicator and 2 charts i think you have to change to 6 to be like EURUSDD.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Well that was a bad idea, luckily only a demo. My other system winning today.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
me 2 still learning, so do not take this as a trading advice if uptrend continues, watch level 1.3235 if price goes there

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I still have 2 longs triggered from the 5M... one still open from the earlier ZZBOT this morning. I'm not sure if my cavalier attitude is because these are demo or not. Not sure yet. I am trying to religiously follow something that Shiva pointed out.... at the start of each DS... look for the last ZZ signal and look for the opposite of this at or near the start of the DS time.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
That's right! Got my charts set up quite good now, but Im not satisfied with the stoch/BB window. It does not match with Price/BB at other settings than 300. 900 at M5 looks ok. But H1 at 75 and H4 at 18 or 19 does not look good at all. (It must be wrong since we don't want to see dis-similarity all the time!)

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Dissimilarity is the exception. Similarity is the rule. DZ zones should be pretty rare.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Exactly! And they are, as long as I stick to stochperiod 300! Also, I should point out that im talking about stoch/BB window, not the StochDifZones indicators!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Other way round. DS should be less. On H4... the last DS appeared and we changed from downtrend to uptrend. The DS closed once the bull flag was resolved and we continued up. So the FOUR HOUR trend is up... in SIMILARITY. If DS were to appear now, it would be sign of a potential change in trend (C.I.T)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Yes. StochBB window you can change to whatever setting you want. StochDifZone indicator must stay at 300/24 for Version1 and 300/6 for Version2.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
OMG! Now I see what I wrote! What I mean was that it must be wrong because we DONT WANT TO SEE dis-similarity all the time! Sorry for that.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I agree, well spotted!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Don't worry dude. This means we're starting to all be on the same page. Hope that page is right! LOL BTW... this move down, prior to NY open (1am) is suggesting strong buying... ie. not enough sellers. Just like prior to 8am London. Asia didn't go higher than R1 which is where price turned prior to NY open.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
There we go! No worries. Keep on sharing!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
DS just ended on the 5M. DS Zone above price, first bounce resistence. DS zone on 15M, above price, has acted as resistence first bounce. DS started not finished on 30M, price within DS Zone, should act as support 2nd bounce DS started not finished on 1H price within DS Zone, should act as support DS zone on 4H almost cleared near the top of the box but not quite. EDIT: changed 15M and 30M timeframes above for correctness 5M DS above 15M DS above 30M DS in price (Mid) 01H DS in price (Mid) 04H DS in price (Top)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Be careful... Price Action is KING!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Quick short +6 due to last ZZ invalid without EMA touching BB and dis=sim between EMA and stoch relative to mid BB. Waiting for ZZ bottom to form and return to last up swing position and maybe take out zone.agree good chance for price to target the 33s lol zz seems eager to paint

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Nice move! That could be the best way to trade the failed ZZ. I must hunt down the notes/post on this tonight.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Here she goes!!!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Absolutely. Still don't think we've seen the last top before switch though. All tops and bottoms have Left Hand space on the chart.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Don't forget..... 1: Across brokers, same time-frame, same currency pair Wait for the dis between the two brokers to occur and press the trigger. This type of dis trading doesn't seem to get spoken about much, but appears a fairly easy way to make some pips. Another 10 pips for tonight, time to go to bed. Happy trading everyone!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
It's called arbitrage.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Plan A: Price seem to respect EMA89 on H1. We got stoch and price outside BB on both M15 and M5. Possible ZZ and Semafor at this point. As long as we don't get dis-sim at H4, im looking for price to get over middle BB and take bull position. Closed candle above middle BB will indicate entry for me. Plan B: Price continues down, but I want to se break of EMA89 before taking position. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Closed my euro short for 27pip and my GBP 33pips done for today Good luck guys

--- 帖子 #275 ---
And we are touching EMA89!

--- 帖子 #276 ---
LOL... my longs are all underwater. I just wish the 30M zone was cleared so that it can start heading back to the 1H trend.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Try to long too.. lol.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I would be nice to pick a bottom here, but too dangerous to me. Look to the left! "No traffic" at all. Price might fall.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I think your right....price will fall

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Im not sure about anything. But I have a feeling that its dangerous to stare us blind at the zones. Remember, we can not trust all zones to be taken out!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I don't have fractal math skills, sorry i can't help much ! People like Burnssss has... Vote for him !

--- 帖子 #282 ---
This is view of the ranges varying in different lengths. My definition of Similarity = the Lows must match /highs must match. The smaller ranges moving against the main trend create the fractals.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Yes, you want to research into Interations .

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Looking at the 15M, the resistance was strong. But there was no way to know if price would clear it or not. I guess one way to look at it is instead of SL, actually put in a counter trend trade if price reverses and comes out of the zone (green). I'm still holding onto my longs. But looks like my Daily forecast will not be successful.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Can you explain this more? Someone else made the comment that the signal was even stronger if it stoch were right at the extreme: 100 for a short or 0 for a long, so why would 70-75 be a stronger signal than 85? (I am assuming you meant for a short--did you mean for a long?)

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Sorry mate... I was reading off my IGIndex indicator... which doesn't plot the values as between 0 and 100. It just takes the overall spread over however many bars can fit into the screen then shoves it into that range... 100 to 75 in my case. Basically.... the more extreme that spike is, the more likely the stoch is going to be outside the bollinger. So if I go mobile and can only see via my phone, if the stoch is in the middle of the range I know that it's not outside the BB. If it goes to either extreme top or bottom, I know it must translate to outside the BB. Angle and sharpness can come into it as well but extremes are the key to reading this, IMHO. Here's a BIG HINT for everyone else. The 300EMA and the 50 Line on the BBStoch can be used as a "similarity" device. Another big hint. Look at it on the 1H timeframe. Hopefully you will notice it. Probably need to zoom out alot (another big hint). And it's related to the positioning of price or stoch.... (Gosh, I'm practically giving it to you! )

--- 帖子 #288 ---
whats up bro,do u have any daily forecast for tomorrow? Regards, Eitan.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
New here... J ust wanted to add something, Bottom and top formation are almost always retested immediately (Volume spread analysis), not exactly to the same pip value but almost close. Post 1 shows two top fractal arrows which looks like a re-test. Instead of going in when price and stoc go below BB, wait for Stoc and Price to come inside BB but approaching the bottom + 3-4 pips (again) and then enter, This will be your confirmation and much better entry (like a discount). Thoughts?- I am back scrolling to see how this works.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Total +22 Eur/Usd not particularly efficient though. Trading 101 plays a big part still and so does matching highs and low

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I started last Wed based on comments by Eurusdd. Projections for Daily Candle: Wed = UP = True Thu = UP = True Fri = Down = Draw (really was UP by 0.0004) Mon = UP (currently false) 3/4 or [2/4 + 1 draw] Hahahaha!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I've played a little with other indicators to show me dis-similarity. Most on 1 or 5 MTF. Where I could find inconsistencies, I have drawn a line. I was shocked when I saw it, but the price traveled a little bit (10-20 or 30 pips) but then return to the line. Still on test, but at 1.3294 there is "something is wrong". I have put on a sell order at 1.3294. We will see.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Is this all derived from the thread started by Eurusdd?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
My projection for tomorrow would be UP, but it depends on Hourly Close... so we will see where she lands tonight.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
0.0004 its ok for BO ..but not for spot.. waiting for your forecast,will folow.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Even 0.0004 is not bad

--- 帖子 #297 ---
In strategy 1, the win rate goes up if you only take shorts when the stoch is 90 or higher and longs when the stoch is 10 or less. The total number of trades goes down so will back test to see if this is worth adding.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
WHAT?! Could you post a chart!? I guess you guys did some nice pips today from that bottom. I noticed that some of you took entry there! Good work!! I was scared to enter the market there. To little experience, not the right tools in my box yet!

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Niiiice!

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Sorry, this chart does not have much to do with similarity, but I still find it interesting because I think its important to know where we have support and resistance when trading Stoch/BB/ZZ or sim/dis-sim or whatever we trade. Price is currently "stuck" between EMA89 and EMA365 on the M15. If it breaks EMA89 I think we could get at nice move up and close the zone. Se also how price respected the EMA365 after that fall it did. Anyway, whats your view of this?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
If you going to post charts, try to stay on the topic of similarity. So the question is, how can you tie this information in to what the thread is about? I am not attacking you, I am trying to encourage to think outside of the box, but inside of the realm.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Don't worry! Ill stick to the similarity from now! Sorry!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Just my opinion about a few things, so take it for what it is worth. Eurusdd gave us a lot to chew on, some of which we can work with now and other information that may have been there to tease us, throw a curve ball or was simply beyond my ability to fully comprehend. I believe in focusing on things I can work with so here are the things I think where we can be productive: 1. The CI method which he used to do 47 trades in a row (or some ridiculous number) without a loss. The draw backs are the CI indicator is unstable. He promised a better one but changed his mind before posting it. A few people did say they were quite successful with it though, so I am posting an updated summary of the most relevant posts on this if anyone wants to pursue this further. 2. The BB-Stoch-ZZ method(s). Eurusdd said this was better but some of the methods were just for “the big boys.” There are a few ideas though we can look at: The 2 methods I am working on are based on his principle that there can't be a trend change without similarity. The hope is that the similarity of the EMA1 and BB's is close enough to the stoch and BB's that with confirmation from the ZZ we have a new top or bottom and can take a trade in the opposite direction. The questions are now do we trade from the extreme to the mid band or the mid band to the extreme. Also, should we wait and only take those trades when stoch is at an extreme. I have someone working on an EA for me for this to test this further. 3. DS zones and how best to trade them. I admit this one gets me confused whenever to I try to figure out how best to trade them. One simple idea I think that should be explored further is setting pending orders to open a trade when a zone is breached with TP on the other side of the zone. We know most will be taken out, so I think we only need to work on the best SL for the few times when the trade is entered and the zone is not taken out in a timely manner. I know there are more, but I think it is best to stay focused on the ideas where we might be able to come up with something we can use rather than the ones we have no chance of replicating with the resources we have available.

Great post!

Posted this on the Similarity Thread: Projection : 30 July 2013 UP DAY Open: 1.32618 Commentary: I have a price target 1.33337. I don't have a day target for this price. I have one zone one the 1H that is begging to be closed from below, top level price @ 3305. I also have another zone (different indicator) with a clearance price @ 1.32992. Prior to today, 1H timeframe had a ZZTOP that was in the middle of the Bollinger Bad insinuating a fake top. What I failed to take into account (still!) is that the zone it was in was very strong resistance. Today, price fell to the bottom of an existing zone that has not been born yet.... 1.32377. And turned, forming a ZZBOT. We have another zone above this zone @ 1.33184, so the move that must happen this week and this can only happen from a ZZBOT.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Fantastic reminder! Here's another one!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
There is also Lirbig's approach if he would be so kind to share what he is doing

--- 帖子 #308 ---
So this is where everyone went... Mind if I join in? Here is a pic of last weeks market with the Stoch Diff Indicator on the 15 min chart, I counted up the bars of DIS similarity and came to a total of 298 bars out of 474 bars for the week. give or take a bar. That is less than 50% Similar. We might want to consider making an adjustment to the indicator(s) to get closer to 90-97% before running too far ahead.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Glad to have you on board, Baillie. Can someone who isn't banned on the other thread post a link to this thread?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I would like to but we should probably ask permission from EURUSDD first. I'll send him a message.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I think this one might be better or not, I have not checked the repainting

--- 帖子 #312 ---
That's the one I use already. I think EURUSDD has a custom one

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Actually this one is a loss. But it seems you don't have a stop loss (or hedging).

--- 帖子 #314 ---
He just showed a graph of the perfect indicator. We never had this one in real. Maybe it doesn't exists and if it exists nothing tell us that it doesn't repaint.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi, congratulations ! but what do you mean by "trading 101" ?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
This is the problem : the thread looks like a chatroom. A lot of noise that is not related to the thread main idea : A PRACTICAL APPROACH. I will stop posting now by respect to thread creator.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Not a loss yet. Still short from that picture at this time. You are correct, there is no SL, but this is also Demo

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Ok, just a 'potentially losing trade'. But no stop loss or hedging = a practical approach ?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Its more of a learning exercise. This indicator unfortunately does not allow for backtesting, thus forward testing is the only answer. And no, its not practical to trade w/o a SL . I am not allowed to hedge, being in the states

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi Neio ! happy to see you reading here. I was impressed by your results you have with the dissimilarity but can't find them in your trade explorer... Do you have another method of trading ? Something practical ?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi FxGunner, To be totally honest I am still trying to figure out a CONSISTENT way to trade this. I have a few good trades then a few bad trades knocks me back. I am not confident in my approach to the similarity method yet. Things I thought I knew do not always work out as planned. Drawdown and recovery can be tough and I am not confident enough to start trading it live yet. I removed the explorers as I was getting too much attention and I blew the one I started last week. As you might have noticed in my explorers I am also trying to combine this with high leverage trading. I want to be able to start with a couple of £1000 and build it up to a nice sum. So in summary still finding my way at the moment if I feel I have something worth sharing I will. Regards Neio

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Heading to bed....here is current pic of same trade from today.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hi Well I don't see the difficulty with the DS methods. Infact, after experiencing what i went through last week i think trading the DS could be so simple. I trade only the EURJPY market. I first tried the DS method 3weeks ago. Unknown to me price at the time was gearing for a two week long up trend, unfortunately, my first DS was below the price so i quickly took a sell knowing that price will always come back to that DS zone. Price went against me -350 pips for my first sell. -250pips for my second sell and 140 pips for the 3rd sell. I noticed that as price kept pushing up it was creating new DS zones below. That gave me more confidence that i should hold onto my sell. Now how do you hold on when you do not have equity? Then i realized. 1. Have a good trading system 2. Take a trade targeting a DS zone. 3. Make sure you have enough equity to last you 800 pips plus. 4. Use the recovery system when price moves further and further away from your zone. 5. Most importantly, Have a little faith that price will come back to your DS zones. Do not chase price. I thought hedging would be great.....I don't think so anymore. Hedging is going to protect your equity, but you not making money that way. Have the courage to take a position and allow price to come to you.....the benefits are rewarding if you practice good money management and by that i mean, being able to hold on to trades for weeks. Make sure you trust your DS zones. 97% accuracy is all I need to have confidence in the DS..... This was on my live account, today i am 250% up in profits because I made money when price finally obeyed the laws of DS. Good Luck.

This is what I have been feeling to when looking at the charts all the way back in Eurusdd´s thread. That is why I asked early on if it was ok to use other stochperiods that gave us less dis-sim! On the other hand, Eurusdd used the 300 setting on the StochDifZones and then that should be right!? But something don't add up to me here. If we have less than 50% similarity with out charts and indicators right now, we should also count in that only about 60% of the zones are valid? Maybe that's why we have so much dis-sim? Don't know if 60% is still relevant, when we use V1/V2 indicators together though?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Someone I can repeat the stochastic settings for all tf possible? thank you very much

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Our problem here is that we don't have full information. That's it 100%. We have been provided a concept that Function A and Function B hopes to derive similarity almost all the time but sometimes doesn't. We can use whatever "indicator" we want as a proxy for A or B. This leads to inevitable inefficiency. Let's not even begin to talk time frames. Bottomline - "we" don't know: what conditions perfectly identifies a dissimilarity what combination of indicators and their settings will yield the above. However, here is the risk. If the author/proponent of the concept says that the Optimal Settings for Ralome's StochDiff Indicator v1 and v2 is 300/24 and 300/6 and they must be combined together when reading the chart.... then we run the risk of getting less than the 60% he already mentioned was capable from BBZZSTOCH method. Not many of us here are mathematicians, so the best we can do is theorise and implement best "trading strategies" using the existing tools that are tuned already according to the "master". He never elaborated on trading strategies - and that was a distinct lack of the other thread. I think this is the heart and soul of what Joe's thread is about. If we start re-optimizing the tools themselves, then borrowing from a Formula 1 analogy - we've changed everything.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Careful. The stochastic and bollinger settings can be whatever you want. The settings of Ralome's indicator stay the same: v1 = 300/24 v2 = 300/6 v2 = unless someone can read the code of the indicator - the change by a factor of 4 to the bollinger band alters the precision (obviously). I don't know what is done to this data. Let me hunt down the formula that was posted on the other thread.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yes it is. If this tool is 60% accurate, Would you be able to be profitable 100% of the 60%? That would be my goal.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
stoch settings: 1min = 1500 with BB 125 (I saw this setting EURUSDD uses in his new thread) / 5min = 900 with BB 24 / 15min and bigger = 300 with BB 24. That is what I think works best.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
It is based on 4500 min in a chart. I don't know where this comes from. His optimal figure for calculation? 4500 = 300 x 15M 4500 = 900 x 5M Now obviously you can't have 4500 in a stoch for 1M.. so 1500 was chosen... but that means it's at a resolution of 3M..... so 1M = 3M (ie no difference).

--- 帖子 #331 ---
yes but the BB for 1500 was changed to 125. Perhaps this matches with 4500 /24 and it's easier for MT4 to calculate??

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Right now I'm focusing on the problem, I do this because there are still things left to relate but until you build the model, I can not improve it. My first step is to study the Hurst coefficient for all tf to make sure everyone keeps relationship with each other, and if not so operate with those who are closely related. Once done and checking the tf that are related to a number of periods, as it may change over time, build EMA1 expressions and STOCH with optimal parameters for one of the tf. construct the expression of relationship (EMA1 = STOCH%% similarity) and point out the dis-similarities. I build the relationship with other tf, and calculate the turnaround points. At the time that both graphs are realigned is where CREO be operated as the level of correction and we have to dis-similarity is above, but this part I have not very clear yet. If you acordais, EURUSDD compartia one chart in which there were two arrows, one with a green dot and one with a red dot. At the time no one appeared, meant that the price would return to that level. Well I think those arrows are relations of which I speak. If someone mt4 expert programming logic would think you can try, but that's the way

--- 帖子 #333 ---
That's an interesting mystery mate. I've collated the following based on the the #1st thread. It outlines the definition of how the Stoch and Dissimilarity is defined in Ralome's indicators (v1 and v2). The settings are the only difference. In effect... it's 300 bars analysed and any differences must persist over 24 bars. If not similarity returns. Changing this means that you have eg. 300 bar population but difference period of 6 bars. This would potentially create MORE DS Zones than the 24.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Interesting thoughts. The drawdown is the problem for me especially as I am trying to use high leverage. But I am trying to trade away from DS zones as I recognise that price can go a long way before returning and this is what Eurusdd recommended doing. Also I mainly trade EUR/USD and have noted that some of the zones expire and do not always get returned too. Which is obviously a problem if you are making trades based on it returning there! PS...Glad to hear you have made this work for you! I hope it continues to be profitable. I am also starting to look at EUR/JPY. It was my favoured pair before I started looking at Similarity but I recognise that what has been given to us has been optimised for use with EUR/USD.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
1H DS Zone born. Funny how price went down to the bottom of that range prior to being born so basically it can only be cleared from above. Does this imply that prices MUST go higher? 1.33X ?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi guys! This is MTF disimilarity indicator which I'm done up to now. Currently, it can draw the "difference" lines only. Dissimilarity zones drawing will be for the next stage. Read indicator's parameters for more info. I may have cut my last hairs to write this one. Please test it.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hey guys, Have been playing around with multiple ZZ's from different time frames on one chart and this is what I have found. It seems almost the opposite of Dis sim zones but rather using "Sim zones" instead.... 1. Similarity will at some point occur between the zz's of two different time frames (maybe more TF's as well but have not checked extensively yet) 2. When similarity finishes, a trade could possibly be taken in the OPPOSITE direction of the direction of price DURING the "sim zone" (example - if ZZ leg is down you would buy and if up you would sell) 3. However, this should only be taken WITH the trend. 4. From a historical perspective price has returned many times to the beginning of the "Sim Zone" without ever having retested the low or high of that particular zone (making your SL fairly safe). Please see attached image: The white lines identify the beginning and end of a "Sim zone" The green line would be your long entry and you can see the red line as TP (when price returns to the beginning of the zone) Vlady do these particular setups confirm or correlate with your method of a ZZ bottom/top at all? Thanks hope this helps possibly. Effex

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Awesome. Thanks.

Eur/Usd needs badly to break ou t of this 1.3240 - 1.3300 range!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I thought that the general idea was to detect when the banks were in the market manipulating price. Afterwards price would then return to a level reflecting natural order flow etc. However banks do this on a daily basis so shouldn't we be seeing this reflected by a zone's appearance and then being taken out on the same day as price returns to its normal ebb and flow? Just wonderin because i'm not really making sense of this after studying it for three weeks now. Has anyone been able to tune this system into a profitable method?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I have a zone born on V1 but not on V2 yet. Sould be a good zone then right?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thank you! Ill get right to it!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I have both born on mine. Actually if I look closely, v1 appears first or is early. But yes, if v1 shows but not v2, the zone should be good when it appears.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Great job, Dewey! Very impressed!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
It does correlate. If the ZZTop and Bottom that you've identified on the 5M, corresponds to say 15M and 1H and they are in phase ie. They are all ZZTops then the logical extension of that is SELL. Whether or not you enter on the next bar or at the BBMid is up to each trader. As for price returning to this point.... welll..... it's harder to say. In your chart's particular case, price went sideways so the return was inevitable. Also, it's 5M so yes, I'd imagine price would return alot. Different story on a trending chart.... you would find that price and stoch stays to one side of the Bollinger and returns to the mid more often. Just something I've observed. The extension of this is that if you spot a eg. ZZTop and you observe price and/or stoch crossing the BB to the other side and then staying on the opposite side - you may have a counter-trend day. If the price behaves like this and perhaps crosses the 300EMA and the StochBB goes below 50 line .... then you'd have a down direction that should become in phase on all timeframes

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Closed some longs on demo. The discussion on hedging and SL is interesting. On an account this large.... all the trades are without SL. If I have projected a higher timeframe direction, then the trade based on that will stay. But a lower timeframe trade that is opposite direction will also stay. So if 1H ZZBottom Signal + my Daily Projection is UP.... then trade is LONG. If price is below Day Open... I could enter with a 10pip SL and leave it. If ZZ is wrong, the it will cost me 10 pips. If I trade without SL... then my account is large enough on 1 lot per trade to keep going and enter until a valid ZZBottom. I guess it's like a fade. I find that the invalid ZZs tend to occur more often on the lower timeframes.... so if you're trading alot at this level (15M, 5M, etc), perhaps a SL is warranted. But if you're trading on 1H or 4H.... well there's only been one ZZ signal per day so far!! Trading in the opposite direction would've been okay! Just vocalising some thoughts....

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Yeaah baby!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Yes!! Price just took out two zones on M5 and the one ive been looking at on M15! By the way did you see that we got dis-similarity again on M15 just after the zone was closed!?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
We got new DS on 5M and 15M.. so now they're synchronised. So this unborn zone will definitely be Support. Dissimilarity ENDED on the 1H about four hours ago.... can anyone explain this then? DS ending in one TF triggers DS on the lower timeframes. The born DS Zone has clearly rejected price and it shot right outside the zone in a northern direction. Dissimilarity continues on 4H - one can only imagine that if it ends we will see a similar spike/reaction. Nothing on the Daily... although if you have Ralome's DS Predictor version... I have 2 predicted zones that haven't printed (error in software? dunno) but the next ZZ is definitely gonna be a ZZTop!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
[ By the way did you see that we got dis-similarity again on M15 just after the zone was closed!?[/quote]Also on the 5 mins

--- 帖子 #351 ---
try draw horizontal lines where disim starts, how that looks, post pic of that then like this, could not see start of the candle, so messy pic, but anyway

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Thats right. Just noticed that. Also got dis-similarity at H1 again! So now I have dis-sim at the same area in three TFs! To me, it will be very interesting to se if this lead to support OR resistance.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
so this is from last week monday

--- 帖子 #354 ---
It implies that whoever gained advantage on the first bar, caused a reaction from the market such that some became sellers and some became buyers, but the point at which the market was in absolute agreement was the LOWEST PRICE of the move.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
starts there where arrow is, then draw vertical line and wait price to come there, then do what you think is right, uptrend, maybe buy?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
That would atleast follow the principle "Trade away from dis-similarity".

--- 帖子 #357 ---
i believe it was here somewhere http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...85#post6785885

--- 帖子 #358 ---
But then, that would also mean DS is a Zone of prices. Or is it? What if we said, if uptrend DS Low is what we trade away from.... and if downtrend, DS High is what we trade away from?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
mark open of the candle, uptrend downtrend, mark that price, price should come back to there, wait price come to you, then do what you do, okey, gotta go

--- 帖子 #360 ---
have to add this, do not use daily or H4, they are not universal things, H1 and M15 are same everywhere in this planet, maybe

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I would agree with this on Daily... ie. Don't use Daily. But the 4H is useful.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
As I see it, that could mean that we have a zone of prices. In this case, where we have uptrend and dis-sim candle opened at prices from 1.3266 to 1.3275 depending on what timeframe you look at, that could maybe be a zone and the mean level at ~1.3270 should maybe be our point where we trade away from dis-sim?! But you maybe mean zone of prices in an other way?! --- So if this could work, we wait for price to get back to around 1.3270 and if we get a ZZ/semafor and a good signal for entry. We go long?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Demo Longs (3 remaining): 50 pip SL in place [this really means 5 pips] LOL TP @ 1.3309 for all posn

--- 帖子 #364 ---
To calculate the DS... stoch must use the CLOSE of a bar. I had asked Eurusdd before about zones and he said, use the HI and LO of the triggering bar. There is no set way for you to enter a trade... it's really up to you and your style. You could enter on the Zone Low. you could enter on the open, or BUY stop on mid/mean, or be ultra conservative and set it at Close or Zone Top. I think what's more important is that if the zone is triggered, you can try and trade away from it. When an extreme (ZZ) is reached, there is a strong chance price will return to that range of prices.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
On the 15M, the current unborn zone is 1.33005 (top) to 1.32734 (low) = 27.1 pips. Remember... the DS hasn't ended yet. So the actual zone has not been "born". It's not in effect. Where do you think price will be when it does come into effect? And therefore, what could price do? My guess is that DS will end and price will be above the new born zone (1.3328 hopefully). So it will act like a magnet and price should go towards it. Probably act as initial resistance at 1.33005 then go through it, perhaps to the mid, then hopefully to 1.32734. We just don't know how long (time) it will take to do this.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Sorry not at my platform. Can anyone tell me if the last ZZ top yesterday got corrected? Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
On the 15M, yes it did.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Actually mate, now that I look back at this on the 1H.... I have a feeling we're gonna have one of these "technical problems" that Eurusdd mentioned. The last two ZZ swings prior to the new one are both out of sequence. ie. The previous HI was not really a high, therefore the following low should not have occurred or been tagged as a Lo.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
SLs triggered. All out. Pending shorts at 1.3309 to 1.3316. Will probably add another at 1.3325

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Nice! should have held my longs longer lol still a bad trader at heart At least theories are holding water and we got a new "reference" level at that price point Yes, I noticed that the entire series of swings was quite a mess. My observation (limited data) when price corrects "fakes" she is usually very efficient. 3 levels imho. Lvl 1)Price moves till a valid ZZ before turn Lvl 2)Price turns 1st makes a valid ZZ and returns in one swing for correction Lvl 3)Anything less than Lvl 2. Like yesterday with the "extra" swings some of which do not appear very valid to me Lvl 3 is rare i think like what you 1st observed and now the technical problem.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Watch out! 15M DS has ended... similarity on the 15M... I will check the 30M and 1H for synchronisation. Big moves happen on similarity. BTW, the 5M scored a ZZBOT so aggressively took a long (demo). EDIT: And another long

--- 帖子 #372 ---

Woow! Zone Clearing Day! Big Zone cleared out on the 1H. Didn't expect that. Higher unborn zone in play... my projection is that this is a buying maneouvre and I've loaded up on Longs. Don't know if I'm right... we'll see.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hello everyone! Nice thread, even better title - practical means it is usable, testable and NOT cryptic (I wonder why some were proud of the "cryptic" presentation of sim idea...). I've tried to approach similarity/dissimilarity from the same angle - make it clear enough to test it and prove it works (or it doesn't). How have I based things? I have neclected the fractal dimension, because I firmly believe that different timeframes are 100% self-similar as lower timeframes build higher timeframes. Data is essentially the same, so you see the same thing only in different scales (timeframes), so I haven't included any form of fractal analysis to my testing work. As a side note - I did experiment with FDI (written a lot about in the fractal finance blog, which link was posted some time earlier in this thread) and I concluded it is worthless in lower timeframes. The base is the idea of signal dissimilarities, the same way as Eurusdd used the cycle identifier. My testing is a work in progress at the moment, but the first stint is done now. How I did it and what did I find? I took Awesome Oscillator, settings: 10,5, Median; base timeframe M5, currency pair EurJpy. Signals are like this: AweOsc rises=BUY, AweOsc falls=SELL. I did the same thing on M1, with a exception of AweOsc parameters: settings: 50,25, Median. Then I compared the signals from M5 to M1 - similarity for 1 month = 88% Then I tested the dissimilarities as trading signals. Mind you, there are many ways to use dissimilarities! Eventually I developed 4 usable approaches. The testing strategy itself: open a position at bar opening after confirmed dissimilarity in the previous bar, TP around 4 points, SL of 7. Eurusdd said if you have a dissim, you're in a high probability trade. He demonstrated it in the trade explorer taking 1 point profits most of the time, therefore I chose similarly to take a tiny profit with nearly twice as large SL. For better evaluation I look only at win/loss ratio, which needs to be roughly 0.70 to show some kind of profit. Alright, now approach and its result: 1. Dissim on M5/M1 (comparing M5 directly to M1, this means at every 5 minutes, trade direction defined by M5 signal) = win/loss 0.67 2. Same as 1. but reversed signals = win/loss 0.57 3. Madmoney approach, taking M1 signals in the direction of M5 signals = win/loss 0.65 4. Comparing current and confirmed M5 signal to the last 5 confirmed signals form M1 (purpose is to align the signals to the used data, in other words I tried to use the same data span to compare signals) = win/loss 0.66 5. Same as 4. but nondirectional, trade direction opposite to the last leg of ZZ = win/loss 0.71 Testing carried out on a reliable platform (not the crapergy tester of MT4). Last notes - I will carry on testing using other indicators, it seems to me that it's quite important what indicator is used, AweOsc is not dishing out tops and bottoms at dissim events.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I'm trying to wrap my head around all of this, so please bear with me.... ..all of this has me thinking, that despite our best efforts, we will never be able to get 100% of the DS zones. The reason for this all has to do with time - right now the comparison that is being used is 300 bars x 15m. However anything greater than this , is not being factored into this.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Great work! This is more of what we need

Great post. In my world moderators should be nearly invisible. The participants in the thread should police themselves in a civil manner. I see this is starting. I expect the thread get more focused after this. As long as you have an idea that is tied into similarity, all are welcome! When xixi gets the mtf DZ indies online then we might ask for a bit of standardization, just to see what works. Until then thanks for the contributions. A lot is being learned!

In the previous thread I posted a chart similar to this one, It's a Daily chart with BW MFI and volume to identify Broker, Institutional Speculators. They are identified by the BLUE bars marked. They also happen to be Sunday bars, I use these zones in my trading ALL the time regardless of which system I employ. WHY? Because these zones we are trying to identify are created by these players, so logically, If these players are in on this bar they will create zones that reject or propel price to and from these levels. EURUSDD said, " support and resistance traders are not far from the truth" Now we also need to know that price movements that you see on your chart are NOT created by the retail traders. If you toss the BW MFI on a 1 min chart you will see every bar starts BLUE, then at some point in that bar they stop supporting that move and at the close the bar prints. You can do the same for any time frame, the players will be in the market at the open moving price to entice other traders to jump in. Anyway, Daily bars and charts are important and should not be ignored, any other bar where there is a close of BLUE indicates the players are all in trying to establish another zone. Look and see if these zones would or would not help.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
The 1H continues to be the timeframe for reference. We now have a ZZTop and ZZBottom, with DS started giving a potential zone (blue horizontal lines) Eurusdd used to say a lot, "where is price in relation to the un-printed zone" hinting that it would be cleared from that direction. So in this case, I would like to think that the Green DS Zone will act as support and price will break 1.33XX to take out that north zone once DS ends. Of course, price could prove me wrong and take out the green zone. However, the fast move we saw today I strongly believe was caused by the "fake" ZZTop which appeared in the middle of the Bollinger Band. This unresolved state created a "black hole" that needed to be resolved. The new Top and Bottom cancels out the wrinkle and thus leaves us with a ZZTop as the next swing. P.S. I triggered the longs based on the 5M which was a bit silly. I should have been looking at the 15M. Lessons learned.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Many thanks for this... very revealing!

--- 帖子 #388 ---
For me these pivot values look very similar ( ) to the "supply/demand" concept. In fact it seems a lot of people are saying the same things with different words or systems. Please do not reply to my remark, this is not the place to do. Thanks for sharing !

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Question: Since this indie takes (HI -LO) divided by Volume, wouldn't the volume be based on your broker's volume only? ie. (not meaning to get into the classic "there is no volume qty" in FX) Don't get me wrong... this is actually fascinating stuff and should help "validate" some of the DS Zone levels.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
very much sums it up

--- 帖子 #391 ---
3 longs closed in profit, taken from Signal #2 on Semafor on 5M. Interim finding is that, if you took the signal as an entry - whilst a drawdown is possible, the target will be reached. Just based on memory, I think I only had 1 day where this did not happen by close of play and I closed the trades at a loss. But you need a large account size, no doubt about it.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Well done Vlady!

--- 帖子 #393 ---
This is awesome work. I will have a look and test it as well. However, this is compelling : opposite last leg of ZZ strategy - increases win/loss ratio. It should give confidence in pursuing and persisting with this "method". Interesting that if you align M5 and M1 signals it was .66 then whenever you took the opposite signal anyway, it increased to .71. Perhaps the ratio can be increased with better entry/exit rules.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Joe, I already posted the first version of MTF DZ indicator here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...50#post6854750 Take a look at it if you want to try before I complete the full version.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Yes, I looked at your pic and got the same conclusion because I saw something. To describe/explain what I saw... We know DS zones being S&amp;R and all that plus now that both our indicator lines are out of the BB (assuming I'm seeing the chart correctly) So stuff should be in BB most of time when they are out of it means......plus this happened at/very near the DS zone and I recall someone mentioned brick wall.So i do not think price has much to travel south. I dare say it is a very high probability long. Will it take out the blue zone yes but when? Is good enough to make pips? Sure. Why? I am very confident price has very little room to move south

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Thanks xixi for your hard work. It was very useful to look in the indicator edit file to see the values you give to the various TFs and stochs. I will keep to those in my tests as its good to have some standardisation.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Maybe an idea to see if your borker is representative of the whole volume in the market: take one support/resistance and measure the buy and sell volumes between the first bounce or break of this line and the second one (maybe this is the sum of the bear and bull indicators). The sum of the indicators should say '0'. Maybe i am wrong : please correct me...

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hey Southern. I'm with it, I understand that EURUSDD would have taken so long, because there are many things that must be taken into account and when aligned as it has incredible results. All data streams must be persistent over time, which if used other pairs is quite possible that this principle does not work

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Yes, Tick volume is broker specific. Your question just gave me a light bulb moment!!! Remember where EURUSDD said this could be traded cross brokers? well the MFI is calculated only one way with volume regardless of which time frame or broker. A cross broker sample looking specifically for the BLUE operator bar starting with the monthly to 1 min chart would be able to identify anomalies to create, I believe more accurate zones or even a specific price to target. Way more accurate than a zone. The only problem in doing this would be that your screen would look like a giant mess on lower time frames because of the same or relatively the same price being plotted from way back when across all time frames. I started to plot these levels by hand on the monthly chart using the BLUE Operator Bar opening price on the EUR/USD. I went back to AUG 1994 and as long as I do not add any more lines from other time frames, I can see price reacting to these levels. I think it could work out on any broker or cross broker sample as long as some of the prices were filtered to be more important if there were numerous prices being identified. Here is a screen shot of what I did, I hope you can understand and maybe we can develop something that correlates with the similarity concept. This is the weekly time frame of the lines I plotted from the monthly chart.

The runners crossing Naz also a EURUSDD thread. Could you explain more about this?. I have not understood because of language, that English is not my native language. thank you very much

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi, Jahanimi: I've been re-reading the original EurUsdd thread. I saw that your records at the early phase of that thread is astonishingly great. Why don't we carry on that route? Have you experienced deteriorating performance after that? i have same doubt for MadMoney. His CI trading is straight winning. why are we still trying to figure out these elusive concepts instead of using the proved successful methods?

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hey Vlady thanks for the reply mate. Do you have a definitive post number somewhere or a pdf or anything that clearly reiterates the main points (as you have found) of a ZZ top top/bottom and the stoch/bb/zz method? If so it would be great if you can share. I have found various posts in the old thread but cant pinpoint your main idea on any particular post... Thanks heaps. Effex.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I have read the old thread from start to finish and agree with your enquiry here and statement, sometimes the basics first are a good place to start again, especially considering the "elusive concepts" being hammered out here, yet none the less even the first successful method was "Hammered out" at one point... The problem with the first CI method is that not many guys could ever agree (or find on their platform!) proper settings for the CI indicator to make it stable in order to provide proper dissimilarity signals... Those that did achieve correct settings and posted their settings on FF did not work on another's platform.... Some guys however could apply the right formula to achieve the correct settings to suit a method for them; And in fact if you look at the way Madmoney was trading it was in fact "His own method" derived from the first post on eurusdd original thread, but not "Exactly" what eurusdd had explained or intended yet it worked for him.... This is what makes the similarity principle so interesting...there are MANY ways to profit from it, the application of which we only have to derive a method of our own. Eurusdd was going to create a "stable indicator" for the original CI method yet never did....Maybe one day we may see something of this from him again if he ever returns to give more insight to his theorem.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
yes...Master said that CI is LEAST used or something like that, but I think CI is LAST used in this dissim thing when everything else is in order, then comes LAST reason for to open the trade, super confirmation or something look that prediction, took 28 hours, and there it is, so there is more than just shooting blindly with CI, and i just love solve things http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...50#post6856150 but, that CI thing works, when used M30 H1, works smaller too, but more relaxing higher timeframes and more pips, so you can do that, demo first few weeks so you really know that indi and behaviour and have confidence

--- 帖子 #408 ---
thanks, CI does show potential in identify swing hi/lo s, i'll look into more.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
IQ I use it together with the intersection of media with EMA1 and the truth that I had never failed until now, I have repainted and made me doubt the system. I try to combine with other indicators to make chances. Personally I like the individual because I'm comfortable. But the idea is always the same. the comparison between two tf. I like to use with the intersection of media and EMA1 because otherwise repainted the lot and could not balance between the 2 tf and the filter applied. In this way I have a confirmation pegadita additional half the EMA1.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
No . The CI method (not "CI thing") worked on higher time frames, but truly worked AS INTENDED on 1m and 5m time frames with the best results as examples provided by eurusdd speak for them selves.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I checked in specifically to see how you were coming along, xixi. This will be a great help to the community! Can't wait for the next iteration

--- 帖子 #412 ---
okey, thanks for the info

--- 帖子 #413 ---
If shooting for 1-2-3 pips works for you, then yes, the 1 min and 5 min TF will work the best for you.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Dissimilarity: Price has moved outside of the zone, now coming back in, so we should expect price to take out the top of zone.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Weakness of CI is that it only tells you about how price is swinging but no estimate of how far it will go. One reason Stoch and BB is "one" up from CI is that you can use it to get an estimate of swing length

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Select 'view', select 'navigator', drag bb to stoch window, then select drop down menu and 'apply to previous indicator'. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Excellent Excellent work! This entire suggestion is more in line with how I normally trade....ie. Demand/Supply and S/R levels that I leave on the chart forever more. What we're doing here is then pre-inputting a chart with key price levels at key timeframes. The process we will need is the reconciling of dynamics DS Zone levels to these "MFI Price levels"...... and you're right.... you can't have them all on one chart as you would go crazy. Question on the MFI and multi-broker - did you download multiple MT4 platforms and export the data? Or do you think that any MT4 platform could be used as a proxy for the tickvolume. Or is it a case of picking the "best" reputable broker? Mine is straight from MT4 so I can't recall who they plugged me into.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I went out last night and so didn't get home til late. As a result there's no daily prediction today. I probably would have said an UP DAY, but I'm guessing. What I will do is disclose the method and let you guys comment and test. I'll do this in a little while.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi Baillie, Are you able to post your indicator and its settings? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Just something I noticed on the 30M. The last Swing Low (ZZBOT) has the STOCH inside the BB. There have been similar instances in the past where a major ZZ swing has occurred and a stoch has been inside BB. I think this will mean that the finishing ZZTOP will break 1.3300.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thanks Baillie, Yes, truly excellent work. Its a Bill Williams indicator. (I can't get the Sunday bars though on my platform) Vlady, great stuff, This maybe gives the numbers that EURUSSD says 'there is a technical problem" . ( ) Its led me to look at Bill Williams in more detail and I am really gaining some useful info here (especially understanding fractals more) http://www.alpari-us.com/en/alpari_a...ill_chaos.html The very second statement on this page sounds like something eurusdd said Williams says that fundamental or technical analysis (link to 4.4.2.1) cannot guarantee steady profitable results because they do not see the real market. Moreover, he says that traders lose because they rely on different types of analysis, which are useless in nonlinear dynamic models, i.e. the real markets.

Attention everyone: the forecast function of my indy has problems on larger timeframes (H1 confirmed, but probably on others too). Solution: TBA.

Hi Vlady, The indicator is standard on MT4 platform, I just changed the colors for mine, but blue is blue on the indicator (not changed) On MT4 go to&gt; Insert tab &gt; Indicators &gt; Bill Williams &gt; Market Facilitation Index (BW MFI) Here is a pic of my indicator settings. BTW, The lines are from the Monthly chart, the red lines are from years ago, 1994 to present, see how they are still relevant? And how recent levels (white lines) are still attracted to those prices.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Just use weekly candle open instead, but this would be a good broker to use since the candle is missing to compare against other broker analysis. But we can still use this for individual broker analysis. I think this is the closest thing we are going to get for MT4 data that will give us a better than 60% similarity data.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
My data is different to yours. So your broker may be more representative of population.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi, The stoch-bb method for me has been the best. I have been using it since last week, though still needs to be tested more. i have taken 23 trades with 100% success rate. 23 profits with no losses. my stop losses are much further away and if a trade goes into a loss then i prefer recovery method. The fundamental of this method is: ZZ will appear almost 97% of times when stoch will hit the bb band. the screenshot is attached as a proof. Ravs

--- 帖子 #431 ---
With this system, would you buy now on hourly? 75,1,1 stoch = 0 and touching boll price =1.3227, under boll price fallen heavily but sim zone started, semaphor appeared and leg painted

--- 帖子 #432 ---
ravs - can you post a chart please. Always good to compare.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
This DZ zone was taken out. What I am trying figure out now is whether it is best to enter when price reenters the base of the zone in anticipation of that zone being taken out, or whether to wait for the BB/ZZ/Semaphor signal.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
YES!.... Waited for stoch to increase, now 5 pips up

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Great trading! Can you post chart with entry? If ZZ appears when stoch hits the bb band, what do you do about it repainting? Or do you enter of the first zz when it appears? Also what TF are you trading? thanks.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Taypot, Though I do not trade hourly but here is what I think - ZZ has formed on hourly. Stoch is also on the outer band. I will wait for the ZZ signal to be confirmed. Which for me will happen when it crosses the daily support turned resistance at 1.32298 I will be interested in placing a pending buy if the price retraces back to 1.32391 with TP @1.32597 and SL at your discretion. But hey I am still a noob with this method. The 23 winning streak might also be luck(I am no EURUSDD So do not place orders based on my analysis with real money.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi joe, Can I ask you how you make use of your RSI and CI ?

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi Handy, It is below

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Good for you! More success to you.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi Effex, The chart has been posted above. Red lines denote entry and TP. Blue arrows are the various signals that I look for. If ZZ appears the outer band I do the following: Place buy at a little distance above the ZZ Place sell after it has been confirmed in 5 mins TP on the other BB band I trade 5-15 mins chart

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I wait for the dissimilarity in the indicators. Believe it or not, this concept is not new. The best person to get books on about this is Constance Brown. It is high level stuff, tho. What I do is I just wait for the RSI to be pointing up, and the Composite Index to be pointing down, or vice versa. Very easy to spot, and works on all timeframes. Similarity returns when both indies are going in the same direction, or one of them is flat. This is the vast majority of the time. I will post charts whenever I spot a DZ in my setup. Also, remember, there is more than one way to apply this principle.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I do not use similarity-dissimilarity. I find it too confusing for my little brain to grasp. And it seems to follow no rules. I know EURUSDD said that most of the time the price comes back to the dissimilarity zone. But most of the times it also seems not to. Also there are too many variables with this method. First of all we do not know if the dissimilarity that we are looking at is the real one or not. According to EURUSDD there is 65% chance of that dissimilarity to be the true one. But I cannot trust my luck. Strong money management might help here. But still even if we know that a zone is a true dissimilarity we do not know if it will act as a support or resistance or it will attract price and let the price pass through it easily. We do not know if this is going to happen then when is it going to happen - at what time the price will return back to take out the dissimilarity zone. On the second thoughts the true ZZ top/bottom might help here. But do we know how to judge a true top/bottom. Too many variables in this method but only if you can manage them properly and find an optimum equilibrium between them then this method can be a real winner. But till then be cautious and keep experimenting.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Thanks Richterzoo!! I hope everyone here gains something from this thread and become wiser with this tricky market. Success to all

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hy Rav, Very good and many thanks for sharing ! We can see during the climb of the ZZ how much it repainted and not confirmed by the stock. Multi-phase setup, each step is confirmed by another one gives the result is more reliable. Please correct me if i am wrong : 1 - ZZ shows a new top or bottom 2 - Is Stock = 100 or 0 (100 here) ? No : wait for a new top or bottom of ZZ in the same direction. If not the same direction, goto 1. 3- Put pending buy above top, pending sell at blue line (and move it on every bar) 3 - Wait for buy or sell tiggered, cancel the other one. 4 - Exit at the last bottom if the price retraces 5 - Exit at ? when price continues (not shown in the graph) For confirmation, your blue line is an EMA ? Wish the best for everybody.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I thought her CI is used to capture the +/- divergence/reversal where the RSI divergence/reversal did not capture. Is it you called the Dissimilarity in the indicators ? OR your dissimilarity in the indicators is refer to the stochdiff created the zone ? How about her derivative osc, can it use for the same purpose ?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi FxGunner, Very well summarised though I do not use the blue EMA for placing my pending order. My orders are more based on the distance from the daily pivots and/or ZZ top/bottom confirmation on 5 min or 15 min. Ravs

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Hi Joe, Would you mind giving me your view on this 4hr difference which I have spotted. I am trying to understand what is happening with these two indicators as there is at first glance strong divergence but I think its just the scale or time of charts I have wrong as it doesn't make sense to me at the moment.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Here I have put them both on the same 1 hr chart. Maybe I can compare them easier like this

Ravs, The 65% of dissimilarity zones being true, is ONLY based on using Ralomes indicator to find the zones. Also thanks for sharing your setups. however, just wondering if you have tried using the below method: Placing one sell limit order above the FIRST point that ZZ appears rather than a buy stop above? This was effective on the 1m time frame to great use by placing a sell limit/buy limit order above or below the point at which the ZZ FIRST appears. You need to be very aware however of the average number of bars it will take for the ZZ to repaint...During different volatility periods this can range depending on the pair as well. Sometimes price hits your order and sometimes it doesn't. Here is the link to the strategy with explanation, perhaps this can be used with the ZZ top/bottom method, just ognore the part where he wants to make it into an EA. http://www.forex-tsd.com/elite-secti...new-lines.html

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Wow thanks Me3w.. i have homework to do. So much interesting stuff today and my demo trades were mostly winners too! I will take a look at CFG MO but in the meanwhile here's an interesting (pretty) view of Joe's indicators with some DS blocked in in blue. They seem to mark turning points, fractals often accompany them and the BF MWI shows most of them as low volume fade areas or high volume fight areas . There's actually one taking place at the moment on the hour chart

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi Joe, OK. I see some thing. Seen also linked to you zigzag Top/Bottom Look forward to your posting.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Just to get back on topic similarity . Is anyone using this template from the other forum? I took a trade after the dissimilarity. Used the fib numbers to get in and out. 1.32418, 1.35192. Practice account up $333.00. I like how it predicts when dissimilarity will begin. I don't know where the template can be downloaded. Any thoughts? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #455 ---
It is now the 6th day price has failed to break and stay over the 1.3294 level. There is massive resistance at this level and two zones (one currently painting) has been acting as resistance at this level. If we spike up now and take out that currently painting zone, I will set my aim on the zones below. That is ofcourse if not price closes and stays above 1.3294. If it does I think we will continue the uptrend. Another thing that makes me feel that we are going down soon is how we have that strong resistance at 1.3294 witch have put us in a rather ranging market when looking at higher TFs, and at the same time we have lower lows on the bottoms each time. There are some zones below that should be closed! At least some of them! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi guys! I'm relatively new to this method but I have traded micro lots using EURUSDD's similarity approach in the past few weeks. Still using the CI method though, haven't really go through the Stoch-BB-ZZ method yet. I just want to say my thanks to EURUSDD, madmoney, vlad, and Neio (for posting the pdf) for the method. Here's my result for the past few weeks: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, I've increased my lot size today to indicate my confidence in the system. I have also set stop losses after the huge loss on 25th July. Still, I am having problem figuring out the core theory/idea behind the similarity system. Hopefully, I'll be able to learn from the experts here. Till then, happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Congrats Xuenn ! As a "practical approach" of the CI indicator : how do you handle the CI repainting ? I am always in the "learning phase". I hesitate into the two methods... CI is really easier but this is the repainting stuff that makes it not easy. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
All right, so that did just happen. It will be very interesting to see what happens now. Got new dis-similarity on M5 right on the bar that took out the zone. Looks like we could get dis-sim on H1 when the bar Closes.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
By the way, that move was huge! I took out the zone in a matter of seconds. Crazy! This is to me a hint that these zones are not just there by coincidence, there is some big forces behind it.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Great post Xuenn! Congrats for your results! The CI method continues to be great profits for many The problem I had (and I think many others) was getting the settings right on the indicator. Did you use Eurusdd original formula on the indicator or did you have to adjust anything? Do you mind posting your settings for us to try out as it seems it differs a lot cross brokers as well when using CI. (in fact this was one of eurusdd main teachings as well - cross broker dissimilarities) Happy pips!

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi FxGunner, Since I am new to this please take what I say with a huge spoon of salt. I have lots of repainting going on in my CI as well. I do not mind some repaintings actually if you trade in the trend. Most of the time, the price continues off in the main trend. (Check #1) I used some of the methods in the old similarity thread (you can find them in Neio's Similarity CI pdf as well): 1.) Trading in the direction of the trend only. You can find similar ideas in the old thread. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2.) I use bollinger bands. 3.) My target is quite small (~10 pips). This may be more of a turn off. 4.) I have a stop loss set. If the stop loss is too far away, I will not take the trade (too risky for me). I tried switching to a smaller time frame (5min) from my previous 30 min/1hr time frame to have a better picture about the repainting issue. Perhaps you can observe the repainting using a demo account? Anyway this is my understanding of the method. Please correct me if there is any mistake.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I did not use EURUSDD's original parameters for the CI. I have two computers running the same platform of the same account- both of them are using different parameters! The same parameters on my two different computers produced different charts. I am ashamed to say that I actually haven't got much clue about the workings of the Cycle Identifier (what are the data used etc). Perhaps other users can shed some light on this? Especially on the price action filter and the length.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Apparently if you have entered this bar, you would have netted in ~50 pips by now Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Really thank you for sharing your ideas. Wish you all the best pips. Ok, i will work on that. The cycle identifier is based on two moving averages as i can see in the code. If i have something valuable to share, i will.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
This is really interesting. I wonder if it is a memory thing on your PC's....

--- 帖子 #466 ---
One of the steps I've completed. The principle of similarity must be used from tf 5 min. 5min tf according to the data used is antipersistent and therefore does not meet the conditions of fractality so the price behaves randomly. Despite having much less data, I think insufficient, the monthly tf is the better show. I will continue my analysis in TF 30, 1H and 4H. This gives us the market testing calculation shows relationships between these tf and the possible application of algorithms to indicate equality between these tf

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I'm back! Thank you for those who spotted my earlier post and encouraged me to plow ahead. I've carried on with Awesome Oscillator, but trying a different approach - constructing a short AweOsc and a longer one on only M1 (previously I compared M5 to M1). The longer inevitably tries to play the role of AweOsc on M5. So, I compared AweOsc(50,25,Close) with AweOsc(10,5,Close). Results a bit unexpected - only a 50% similarity between signals! For the sake of the similarity principle, I tested different parameter after parameter to get as strong similarity as possible (to ease things I kept the original 2x distance between slow and fast period). Parameter set of 48,24,Close produced similarity of 90%. Initial testing on 1 month of data, keeping the same closing point of SL7/TP4, trades opened at bar opening after confirmed dissimilarity: For 90% similarity: win/loss 0.65, 442 trades. For 50% similarity: win/loss 0.66, 1184 trades. I wasn't happy with M5/M1 signals, as they were not even close to relevant turning points, but M1-only-signals are different. For the 90% similarity trades are happening quite close to tops and bottoms even though win/loss ratios are quite sad. It seems that the signals themselves are more nondirectional than directional. It's a fuss to nondirectionalize the signals, but this what I'm gonna do next! I'm yet to test another indicators, but I'm feeling more upbeat about SIM than I was yesterday.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi, Are you comparing one tf to another tf for fractality or are you analysing timeframes separately? If it is not a secret, how are you carrying it out?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
EURUSDD said early in the primary thread that any two indicators can be used to spot dissimilarity as long as those indicators are similar 90 percent of the time or better. The dissimilarity is in the indicators. I have not used her derivative oscillator enough to know.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I am conducting a study of tf separately. Through a series of mathematical expressions to calculate the Hurst exponent, and if this exponent is between 0.5 and 1 indicates that the series has fractal behavior. The calculations are very simple and are as follows: - First calculate the price returns: return = Ln (Pt/Pt-1) -After calculating the average of the returns - Calculate deviations from the mean (x) -calculate cumulative deviation (y) - Calculate the range of (y) ---- (R) - Calculate the standard deviation of returns (S) - We divide R between S, R and S range the standard deviation - Calculate the Ln (R / S) -calculate the ln (n) where n is the number of elements of the series - H = ln (R / S) / Ln (n)

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I believe Hurst was one of the major contributors to this stuff, There is an mt4 indi if I remember but like most indi's wasn't much good.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
The indi mt4 not make precise calculations because it is not a mathematical software

Daily Prediction Method Hi all, I didn't get time the last 2 days to post daily projections. Yesterday, I eyeballed the charts in the morning GMT and mentioned it could be an up day. It turned out it was. Today, I did the same although I had noted where the price had closed last night. Below is the method. PREMISE Eurusdd mentioned in the original thread that we had everything we needed on the chart to predict daily direction. He said he could do it within 1 hour of the new day. This fascinated me. Looking for the answers, I discovered the following: ZZ = ZigZag Indicator, but you can also use Semafor 300EMA = 300 exponential moving average Price = Price on main chart. You can plot a 1EMA on it if you wish Stoch = Stochastic set to 75,1,1 for the One Hour and 50 Line dividing the indicator window PriceBB = 24 period Bollinger Band StochBB = 24 period Bollinger Band on the Stochastic Indicator window 1H CHART ONLY If PRICE is above 300EMA, the default daily direction will always be UP. Other things to look for to support an UP projection PRICE is also traveling the upper half of the bollinger band PRICE closes the day near a ZZBottom and the next major swing into the new day has to be a TOP. STOCHBB is above the 50 Line Stoch is also travelling the upper half of the bollinger band​ ​​ If PRICE is below 300EMA, the default daily direction will always be DOWN . Other things to look for to support an DOWN projection PRICE is also traveling the LOWER half of the bollinger band PRICE closes the day near a ZZTOP and the next major swing into the new day has to be a BOT. STOCHBB is below the 50 Line Stoch is also travelling the LOWERhalf of the bollinger band ​​ Other things to look for Counter-trends during a main trend occur when PRICE: Creates a ZZ swing Travels from one end of the BB to the Other and crosses the MID If the Counter-trend move is in a Bullish Trend: When this happens, look for the StochBB to go lower than the 50 Line momentarily to signal a ZZBottom before continuing upwards If the Counter-trend move is in a Bearish Trend: When this happens, look for the StochBB to go higher than the 50 Line momentarily to signal a ZZTop before continuing upwards Changes In Trend Are Dramatic and tend to be Vertical in change. That means the price travels across Bollinger Bands in vertical fashion or a violent suddent way. The 300EMA and the 50 Stoch Line and the Bollinger Mid are measurements of the 50% line where it swings from UP/DOWN. By taking the above into consideration, you are then able to make a projection based on the Hourly Closing price of the day + 1 hour into the new day. I factor in the movement that was made during New York and London and think about what Asia would want to do. I don't factor in news or announcements as this dilutes the above "signposts". If you can prove this for yourself - then you can tweak it by adding: News / Calendar events Candlestick patterns MFI volume (thanks Baillie!) Fibs and Pivots (I used this myself and it worked out well: if projection was up and Open +1 was above Daily Pivot, I was more confident). Attached is the 1H as of now-ish. See how the StochBB has moved below the 50 Line!.... is that signalling something? Enjoy!

Thanks Vlady, this is great. Its really good to have clear guidelines. I am a bit of a butterfly when it comes to trading so all the different ideas have me trying out all sorts of things and getting distracted. I have to say that I have been profitable with most dissimmilarity ideas so long as I avoid trading around the news and have just opened a trade explorer in celebration.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
This is great stuff! Thanks a lot for sharing!

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Vlady, i hv similar way to determine general trend, but i use 288EMA (not so different with 300EMA) and BB 72 applied to that 288EMA with dev 1 and level +/- 2 to 10. we can use same setting for H1, M15, or M5.. because the 'time' ratio will more make common sense.. btw sorry if the image too wide..lol Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Thanks for the feedback guys. Currently seeing a "black hole" on the 5M chart which is why I've loaded up on longs for the 5M timeframe.... so essentially my time goal is to get a ZZTOP on the 15M. 30M has given a ZZBOT and Dissim ended giving birth to a zone that is higher than price - will it attract and repel price? The conflicting signals are that 1H has not completed a ZZBOT yet. So I'm on a countertrend trade. But loaded up big style on shorts.

Hi, can you please show how (with charts, 2 chart), where, when you did get that huge loss? like detailed explanation, thank you there is a reasons why i want to see this... first... maybe you was not trading right or this could fail sometimes(M30/H1), i think it could fail...when market is veryveryvery slow and get sudden volume coming in... or high impact news when price moves up and down very fast

Hi, Apologies for the omission: ZZ = 24,5,3 Semafor = Default. But if you wanted a super clean chart, change Zone 3 to 24 and the corresponding setting to 5,3 or 1,1 - they will then match the ZZ.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
wanted to ask one thing: when we EMA1 window and BB and in window 2 have stochastic and BB with the configurations indicated depending on the TF, two windows to compare, compare different timeframes? for example 5m and 15m? I think I messed up a bit.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
If you're doing it visually and not using Ralome's or Xixi's indicator, then yes you have to scale the 2 timeframes back to the same equivalent. Base = 300 bars and Bollinger period for 24. Base time = 4500 minutes (??? I don't know what reason this number was used.... optimised for EURUSD? Dunno... he never said) Therefore.... 15M = 300 bars 05M = 900 bars 60M = 75 bars Also, from a purely mathematical point of view.... I also don't know why the period 24 was used in the Bollinger. If EMA1 is bollingered to 24 periods.... are we not representing the moving average of 24 time bars?

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi Burnssss, if i'm not wrong, compare window 0 ema1 and bb24 with window 1 stoch 75.1.1 ( me 72.1.1) and bb24 on stoch.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank you very much. Bülent.

Right. I wondered what I think I'm rolling and now I need the specific concept of how to study similarity dis similarities. I if one side I have TF15 min. Study the similarity in this timeframe with EMA1 and STOCHASTIC (300,1,1) On the other hand tenfo 1H tf. similar study in this timeframe with EMA1 and STOCHASTIC (75,1,1) 15m timeframe sI in I get a dis-similarity framework for surely at that point I appeared 1H timeframe. then operated in 1H timeframe to that point of dis-similarity occurred in 15 min timeframe. Makes sense?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Isn't it just the cause and effect of bar #301 coming into the frame? For the 15M.. it will arrive sooner because there are 4 bars for 1 bar of 1H. However... the 300 HH/LL average of the hour bars may not be dissimilar with the addition of the new bar at 15M.... dunno - am i making sense?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
It is necessary to refine these concepts to obtain good results for predictive. It is clear that you have to play between several times. or maybe EURUSDD is making sure that both tf are in similarity to well to predict the turning point. If we know the point of dis-similarity, we expect that both align tf, tf both will correct that point of dis-similarity

--- 帖子 #489 ---
If I remember correctly... the BB setting of 24 holds the time "quantity" for dissimilarity to return back to sim. ie. If bar +301 creates dissimilarity value. And this value/variance continues for another 24 bars then the periods will continue.... if any bar after the 24 bar period goes back to the old value then dissimilarity ends. Something like that. I posted a PDF attachment on the Zones, search for it on this thread - Ralome gives the explanation.

Can you use Matlab ?

You might want to look at this - http://codebase.mql4.com/6700 I am not a math expert, but this discussion about Hurst came up recently on a different Eurusdd thread, hence why I had the link. Hope it helps

New version: v2.60 Changes: Fixed some bugs (everything should be OK up to H1) Included the pre-zone feature which I wanted to do a long time ago, but they beat me to it Added a new feature: we had a dashboard for upcoming zones, now we have one for existing ones too. Kinda like a map Known bugs still existing: No zones drawn in H4 &amp; D1. Solution TBAWIR Greets, Ralome

Thanks Ralome for the indi update mate!

Thanks Ralome, your help is really appreciated.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Recalled just this morning that the attached BB Squeeze was in my archives so I dug it out and threw some instances on my charts and found the visuals intriguing. It's MTF and should be nrp as mladen was involved with the coding and he's not one to waste his time with repainting indicators. As my chart background is light you will want to change the black colors to white for darker backgrounds. Perhaps this has no application to what is transpiring here but I'll leave that for the community to determine. Best wishes for all of you. Steve

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Thanks Ralome, look forward to trialing it. Have made my trade explorer that I started today visible to Similarity Buddies and are the proud owner of 38 pips. Not bad, considering I've been out enjoying myself after lunch. It was a bit of a roller-coaster today on the Forex markets and I was only trading 0.1 pips which was just as well at times. I did hedge though as I would do in real life.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Sounds interesting but could you maybe post chart where we can se an example of how it should look?

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Congrats Taypot!

--- 帖子 #499 ---
If, matlab is a powerful software for these calculations

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Interesting, had not seen so. In this way one could know the duration of the cycle.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
This individual is fine, but not has precision in mathematical software, is used to find the persistence over time and thus do not operate on random times. It is used to detect dis-similarity, only know if we are in a cycle in which we can apply the equalities of functions

--- 帖子 #502 ---
spufuz - absolutely correct. If mladen was involved it will be the dogs bo**ocks. He is one hell of a coder.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
If I understand what your saying - you need to know ahead of time the cycle length, in order to be able to properly apply the equality equation? Something like that can be run in an EA, using the Optimizer function to determine best cycle. For what its worth, the author of that code does point out the Hurst index does not give direction...you'd still need some trending indicator.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Thanks for the input Ralome!

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I think after looking at both and I think I got something. You ought to strip the principle of similarity, return home. taking two graphs, one tf15m and 1H and observe other equalities between them. price marking where discrepancies occur, wait for similarity and bum, price touched. If you think you set an expression would be possible to quantify when a node is next to be played, but for now I think the implantation of this principle is very serious and the difference between indicators and EURUSDD ralome is the accuracy, EURUSDD performs calculations in platform appropriate, using each of the points while mt4 not performed with that precision. So one has a probability of 60% and another 97%

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Wow, this is good if you are observing this in your work. His solution is an application/platform that is outside of MT4... so that's a step in the similar direction.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Yes, and you can clearly see when the Hurst is high in the charts because of the TF apart we are, the graphics are similar so there is similarity. It's complicated tf observe between two widely separated, eg between m15 and 1H, due to noise in m15 is difficult to observe the dis-similarities. BB confuses me because it does not match in tf. The parameters I use to m15 are: -EMA1 -stoch 300,1,1 -bb 24,0,2 and 1H are the same as for m15 CI indicator may give a clue to the duration of the trend, until the fall to find a new price. be reconciled so well with this system.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Excellent Excellent work! Thanks appreciate that. This entire suggestion is more in line with how I normally trade....ie. Demand/Supply and S/R levels that I leave on the chart forever more. That is how I trade too, along with Volume analysis and more recently; Similarity. What we're doing here is then pre-inputting a chart with key price levels at key timeframes. The process we will need is the reconciling of dynamics DS Zone levels to these "MFI Price levels"...... and you're right.... you can't have them all on one chart as you would go crazy. Yes, but not just key time frames, we are considering key price on ALL time frames. To do this, we would need to gather all the open prices and closing prices identified by the BLUE MFI bar on ALL time frames collectively, we would then, reduce the number of price levels to those only that appear on ALL the time frames for the price levels that remain. It's a big task to do this by hand and eye like I did for the Monthly chart, some sort of scanner/sorter would be needed. Question on the MFI and multi-broker - did you download multiple MT4 platforms and export the data? No, I do have 2 brokers but I only plotted the lines on one broker so far, I was hoping one of our coding geniuses would be up to the challenge, as I am handicapped in this area of expertise. Else, It will certainly be a long and tedious process to do by hand, might take years to accomplish such a thing. Or do you think that any MT4 platform could be used as a proxy for the tickvolume. Hmm.. Mt4 runs on tick volume. Don't understand your question. Or is it a case of picking the "best" reputable broker? Mine is straight from MT4 so I can't recall who they plugged me into. I use IBFX and Im checking out Fin FX (non US bullshit) honestly, I do not know what would be best, because of my limited computer skills. But as for a guess, I would say, the top 3 bucket shops in the US and 3 ECN dealers. Hopefully, one of the coders here could point us in the right direction. Having said all of this, I know that this is a direction that has in my opinion, the best chance of breaking that 60% barrier of similarity without further explanation from EURUSDD. Which, I do not think will ever happen. But It is interesting that EURUSDD has opened another thread titled " Tight Horizontal resistance / support zones" though he has limited his participation to posting price levels. Look forward to hearing from anyone interested

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hmm. sound like what I have been thinking about, just posted on something similar along those lines. wrong quote, meant for BURNSSSS

Great thread, guys. Is there any way to code an email alert when DS starts on the StochDifZoneX_v1_2? Thanks for any help in advance.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thank for your reply. Just to let you know, if you understand the advance RSI, can be used to look for the break, no need for strength meter.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
The RSI becomes ineffective in a strong trend, so one why around that problem was the Composite Index, which is more than just the RSI of the RSI if you look at the code. It is one reason why these two indicators can be used to spot dissimilarity.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
OK. I got 30 pips for this trade. This is what i am trying to tell you: "if you understand the advance RSI, can be used to look for the break, no need for strength meter". you can trade above 60 level with acceleration if you know how. the macd is used to show the momentum.

That was an amazing post. I get what you mean now. That's one hell of a job! Guys, what do you all think? Is it worth doing? Many months and perhaps more than a year now there was a brilliant trader named Cloggie. Prickly character but he was awesome and he always called levels from like 4 and more years ago. So I think it's worth it.

Good morning! As a simple exercise: ZZBOT has formed. What's the next swing? Can you try and predict where, using the BB? Based on this alone, I would say UP DAY. But u can also add that we're in a completed zone's prices. Support? definitely. i forgot to add... If you can set your self a daily bias: How would you trade lower TF? 1M,5M,15M? would you trade counter trends as well as trend? how would you handle SL? Or would you hedge?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Sure looks like an up day from that perspective! Im just a bit concerned about the stoch-BB that is well under the middle line. This could mean a trend change! The EMA5 is about to cross EMA8 at daily chart too. Im not saying you are wrong, just that we should be a bit careful at this time!

--- 帖子 #520 ---
large fortunes are behind major algorithms. This topic is very interesting, but not easy to implement. Recall that EURUSDD has taken about five years into it. To us it saved about two years, only to see these market failures. I would like to continue with your explanations but I think your system has been successful and will be refined

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Good morning! As a simple exercise: ZZBOT has formed. What's the next swing? ZZTOP Can you try and predict where, using the BB? 1EMA touch or out of BB + stoch touch or out of bb + stoch at or very near 0 + simlarity between the two is best Based on this alone, I would say UP DAY. But u can also add that we're in a completed zone's prices. Support? definitely. i forgot to add... If you can set your self a daily bias: How would you trade lower TF? 1M,5M,15M? 15M would you trade counter trends as well as trend? Yes how would you handle SL? Or would you hedge? I pray real hard? Actually still trying to figure out a sensible way to do this.......

--- 帖子 #522 ---
This thing that Baillee is describing would have to be another method. I wouldn't want to call it a system yet. That would imply that it's been tested and proven..... no it hasn't. It's more like a cooking recipe - ingredients and method but open to people's interpretations! S/R and D/S was how I was taught to trade so it's my natural instinct and I therefore think it has merit. How we combine this with Sim/Dissim is the challenge.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
CFDA! Good morning mate! You're getting it! Gee that made me sound like a guru... definitely not mate. But it really comes down to accepting the parameters of the method and then tailoring it to suit your personality. I was at a business function last night to do with property investing. I was in a group talking about a well know property guru with an investment method. We were discussing the fact that it was great in theory but not that great in practice from the perspective that people weren't getting it right. I responded with an analogy.... just because Jean Paul Gautier (famous designer) has made an amazing jacket doesn't mean that it will fit you correctly or will suit your body, face, shape, etc. It's still an excellent jacket with excellent materials but the design has to be tailored for it to fit you. This is no different to trading a Principle or Concept or Idea.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
This is my long range 1H showing the 300EMA is now devilishly close but price is still above it, so the default outlook will always be UP unless signals say it's not. The StochBB in the lower range reflects price action. So basically we've seen a series of shorts for 2 days. It would be natural for an up day to occur as a breather.... besides it's Friday and we may see some profit taking. The blue line 1.31365 is a S/R from the month so it would be a key price if it was broken. ========= If ZZBOT then next = ZZTOP Where is price now in relation to ZZBOT? It's at midline. You could Long and SL at ZZBOT? You could long and no SL. That's for 1 hour!! So if you go to the 15M you can see that it's just done a ZZTOP but it's not a ZZTOP on the 1Hour so it's not finished. You could Short on the 15M until it forms a ZZBOT.... then take 2 longs.... one to exit on the next 15M Top and the other to exit on the 1H top. guys I am making this up as I go along. What I hope to be demonstrating is that I am using the parameters set by the indicators that everyone has worked so hard to write and understand. The parameters act like a pendulum giving me a beat to dance with. I enter a trade on a beat or inside a beat.... and I exit on the appropriate future beat. EDIT: Where is the 1H ZZTOP going to be? Firstly, I don't care about repainting... if I am expecting a zztop, then I should have been long from underneath so I wait until it's confirmed. The upper BB band on the 1H is at 1.3246 so any price above this will be a potential. Current price is 1.32169 so you have 20.x pips to play with!

Ranging market at the moment and NFP later so not trading but have left 4 orders based on zones only (see blue rectangles). Whipsaw will happen of course but there seems to be a increased buying of USDJPY prior to today (I keep a little .01 USDJPY running for real just to keep my eye on developments in that currency pair) I suspect that EURUSD will fall so I may place a fifth order below

BTW I think I am bearish on the Eurusd... I posted before on other thread about the descending triangle formation on the monthly. When a move out of that comes (most likely down) it will blow stops and there will be big profits.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Yes, Thanks vlady for putting it into words, I need that! There are two ideas here for my latest system. As a trading butterfly i need to pin myself down a bit. 1...I have used the fractals (Bill Williams) and placed a sell below the low of last down bar marked by a fractal to target nearest zone below and take profit there as price will probably find support. Of course a fall could be strong so this leads to the next order 2. Once price is in the zone i have placed orders to target opposite zone edge Just in case price does rise I have placed hedges using same idea. I am watching CI action on the chart below for shorting opportunities too.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
could fail with big news, spike down and up was so fast, big news is no time to play with CI dissim , there was a "must repaint situation" and this is demo, over 1000 pips in no time, lol i think this is my kind of trading, but not in news time

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Seems that depending on the indicators you use, your either trying to isolate situations where they are 90% Similar/10% Disimiliar or vice versa It had never occurred to me that an actual cross on 2 MA's is the only time you have similarity.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Or, that past points of Similiarity (using MA) = Future targets

--- 帖子 #541 ---
So ....going back to what everyone is used to seeing (BB/Stoch) See where this needs to go ?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Great observation!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Thank you.....now if someone smarter than me can explain the DS thing (birthed and unbirthed as vlady has pointed out), we might be able to link the two concepts together.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
On a day like this (when NFP is on), the concepts that we've struggled with for just over 7-14 days (started looking at this 15th July I think) has turned a $5,000 demo account into $17,600. There is something in this guys. It's not perfect by any means - and I would say it's a manually triggered method, but gosh when you get into the rhythm of the signals, it can be quite rewarding.... don't give up! Keep up the brilliant work, ideas and suggestions!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Well done Vlady!

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Using Ralome's newest indicator -

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I don't think we have a definitive answer Almo. It's more like mixed ideas and implementations. But the general principle is this: Self Similarity Normal Market conditions = trend. This means the price of EURUSD is the same across all timeframes because all participants see the price and agree to buy/sell at that price. Subsequently all activity is at equilibrium, whether or not you are a 1M scalper or 1MONTH position trader. The key concept here that we as MT4 chartists are concerned with is that if PRICE = PRICE, then we can substitute price with another "indicator" or derivative of price, eg. Stochastic which in itself is an average of prices over the last x bars.... and if similarity in prices exists, then the shape of both PRICE and STOCH should be the same. Therefore no surprises. Dissimilarity Abnormal Market conditions = change in trend A set of circumstances that reflects an arbitrage movement, where some big player(s) has or have taken advantage of an opportunity. This "movement" may display itself as an anomaly in a price indicator in one timeframe and not another. In essence, from the eg. above: PRICE &lt;&gt; STOCH because a new bar in, for example the 1M bar has a significantly HIGHER HIGH creating a difference and upsetting the equilibrium. ================== WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? The dissimilarity is always triggered by a PRICE BAR. The Hi and Low of that bar represents price extremes that can act as Dynamics Support and Resistance for the future - UNTIL PRICE RETURNS TO THAT AREA and goes through it...... thus eliminating it and sending a message to the market that the arbitrage opportunity from that price range is gone for the time being. The period of time that PRICE is dissimilar usually marks an upheaval: a change in trend or a big push in continuation of a trend, but at a better price. The mathematical concept of Dissimilarity means that any 2 price indicators or derivative of price can be compared for and provide a comparison for similiarity. The author of this idea, Eurusdd, started out using: The Cycle Identifier (CI), then The StochBB method - which he described as being 10% more efficient than CI RECENT IDEAS A majority of the ideas and templates work on the basis of 4500 minutes, equating well with the 15M timeframe on the MT4 charts. That equals 300 bars of historical price, over which SIM or DISSIMILARITY is tested until a trend is either maintained in 24 bars or not. Recently, the idea that we can try and STACK the dissimilarities over multiple timeframes has gathered speed. The premise that once a disruption's effects are felt - the market eventually evens out. This could happen instantly (smaller timeframe) or gradually (smaller to larger timeframe).

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Just so you know Juhanimi, I thoroughly enjoy your posts.. To anyone who is still trying to adapt the similarity principle (though I guess most people are settled at this point); perhaps I could offer a thought on using the concept, what would you do if you knew the approximate location of every top and bottom on your chart...think as laterally as you can..

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Look at the PINK BOX. This is when a CHANGE IN TREND OCCURRED = Dissimilarity was happening. Price crossed the range and then eventually, it stopped. When it stopped, markets went back to normal and the trend that was established for the timeframe was bearish. The GREEN BOX now represents an UNRESOLVED RANGE OF PRICE that the market will eventually RETURN TO. So as you can see... as it travelled south, another range of DISSIMILARITY occurred, and then again at NFP. One key here is that the price RANGE of the GREEN BOX is alot wider and thus STRONGER in pull than the other smaller one. BUT The fact that price was underneath both of the "born" zones means that the only way to ATTACK the ZONES and CLEAR/RESOLVE them is from underneath. This means it is a LONG TRADE OPPORTUNITY. NOW Price has reached the GREEN BOX. It's not as simple as to expect that price will just go through it. What we have learned many times is that the first reaction is like a shy girl..... you'll be rejected and rebuffed, but you'll still be attracted to her until she let's you in. Apologies for the crude analogy but I hope it paints the picture

Here's a simpler analogy. Imagine you are a passenger in a car (EURUSD) travelling at 60 km/hr. All of a sudden the driver (Big Players) accelerate to Formula 1 speed @ 120km/hr What happens to you if you're drinking a can of coke? You physically get jolted backwards and won't be able to move until YOU AND THE CAR are at equilibrium. If the car stops going fast, you will feel the momentum change. You are not the car, but you are inside the car and are therefore travelling at the same speed even though inside you are cooly drinking a can of coke in sitting position. ========= You are like the Stochastic Bollinger Band indicator. Price is EURUSD The speed is a timeframe The driver are Big Institutional Investors The point where the car accellerates is DISSIMILARITY STARTING The point where the car returns to normal speed is DISSIMILARITY ENDING or SIMILARITY RETURNING Jolts in PRICE require indicators to catch up before you are in equilibrium with the speed of price. What if you marked all the price levels where these "changes" occur on a chart, eg. GREEN BOX? Would that not be advantageous?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Exactly! We have seen this happen many times. That is why I was skeptic when it was discussed if the right thing to do was to put a pending order at one side and an T/P at the other of a zone. - Its simply not certain that the zone will be taken out just because price enters it! It also acts as S/R. In this case, dis-sim started and trend changed, went up and found that green zone as resistance! But now what?! Will that zone act as resistance until we get similarity again and another dis-sim starts to take that zone out finally!?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
It's better not to treat them as trade triggers but destinations. Which is why I personally don't create a pending order on one end and TP at the other. If anything, Eurusdd would say "trade away from the DS" but this can be interrpeted 2 ways: As soon as DS ends, trade in the opposite direction As soon as price is the furthest away from a DS Zone, watch for price to start approaching or heading back towards it and get in early. ~Therefore, I rely pretty much on the STOCHBB method because the ZZTOP/BOT trigger is synchronised to the 24 period of the Bollinger. Remember that if you are using Ralome's indicator: 300 bars are compared. If a dissimilarity value is detected, the zone will be marked and will continue to be marked until after 24 bars when there isn't a dissimilarity. I actually did a count randomly one day... can't remember which timeframe.... but it was roughly 26 bars before the next ZZ swing occured. Then I counted again and it was 25. So it was in sync timing-wise. AND OF COURSE IT WILL REPAINT..... so hence if you knew where the BIG ZONES were in advance and you entered at the furthest position away from them.... then when price returns to the zone.... you can exit at first touch! If price hovers around, you could choose to trade into the zone and TP the zone's other extreme price. As long as you know where you are in relation to the ZONE.... that's where your trade is.... the gap!

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Okay... 1M shows DS ended. I've been shorting this everytime it's painted a new ZZTOP on the 1M. Positions underwater. But on 5M, ZZTOP has just formed and the bollinger bands are near horizontal.... therefore a ZZBOT must be a vertical drop.. let's see The 5M also has us inside the zone for the first time. Could be more resistence. On the 15M, ZZTOP formed... so more shorts. Let's see.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
I like this analogy - I can relate to it [especially now, after what appears to be rediscovering the DS zone using alternative indicators] Thanks Vlady

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I'm trading the other side I can see why you would be shorting if you were out from the NFP news....but I can't let go of this long while its continuing to go up.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Is it real money? I don't have the same levels as you. I have 1.3336 as the top of that box. Anyway, not important. You're in the green. If she was to go down on the 5M... she would drop to your entry price. I'd take the money now. You won. You didn't lose. You don't need it to get to that zone end to be a winner.

No..just virtual dollars. I need a few more weeks of solid returns before I start to consider going live. I see the huge potential in all of this...just have to keep plugging away

--- 帖子 #561 ---
That being said, isn't it the same principle as for example a 15m volume climax bar taking place within a 60m non climax candle? As climaxes often distort equilibrium. Somehow I think I am missing something here as underlying shorter TF momentum spikes below higher TF candles is a very ancient concept? What is so new and refreshing about this, why is it hyped in the first place

1. When looking at the charts, this could work if we wait for the next ZZBOT or ZZTOP, OR just got one before the similarity started. Look at the charts. What do you think? Is this how you do it? 2. This is very hard for me to grasp. How to know when we are furthest away from the point of dis-similarity! Im having small lightbulb flickering moments sometimes, I just whish the lightbulb will stay on some day! One step at the time! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Robert, can you post a chart ? On that chart, mark the points where you are seeing this. Eurusdd said this concept can be used with any two indicators, it will be interesting to see how its coming up on your chart.

Hmm i used the same settings for 15m on the bb,ma and rsi looks pretty good

--- 帖子 #566 ---
J.P.G fits you nicely my friend

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Therein lies the rub, spufuz. What it looks like is dependant upon the settings and that's my current side-project. Since yesterday, time permitting, I've been looking at a variety of TFs and inputs relative to what is transpiring on this thread vis-a-vis the interaction of BB and Stochastics. The indicator provided earlier is designed to illustrate dead or non-trade zones when the BBs are contracting/ranging. Those are the Black or White dots (depending on your chart background color) located on the center line of the histogram. This is also a heads up that either a trend continuation or reversal is in the offing. The attached manual explains and illustrates this breakout concept far better than I could. Thus far a cursory examination under a variety of parameters has yielded non-trade zones cropping up prior, during and after S/DS alerts. Presently there's nothing definitive settings-wise that I would swear to but this project is just beginning to crawl. Of final note before you settle down to peruse the manual (I assume). The reason I had archived this indicator was that it was great at telling me when not to trade but tardy by a bar or two on identifying the next trade. That's where the S/DS alerts should provide an edge.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Thanks a lot! Very interesting! Looking forward to se more input from you in this thread!

As an exercise, on page 8, can you spot the dissimilarities without any more indicator ? I believe yes : the dissimilarity is when the stochastic makes a second bounce higher with price going out of bollinger (just after the comment). There the ZigZag would have retrace up. It is clear we must be hours watching the prices and the indicators to understand their behaviour. i don't use the Cycle Identifier. Don't like how it repaints, especially this is not easy to analyse a trade after the facts : The indicator has all moved to another shape of information. The dynamic lookout is too far from the static one.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Is the following manual desimilarities correct ? Also take note the rejection to the Yesterday's Low

--- 帖子 #572 ---
what i draw looks like yours..must be good hehe

--- 帖子 #573 ---
In case it has been over looked or forgotten : Every swing high or low will be returned to at some point of time.

hmm GU 15753 looks a long way off let alone 16382. Of course it can take years not just months.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Indeed! This is where focus and targets will shift to the smaller swings in between. Trading them effectively is something i am still working on.

Hello all. Hopefully by tonight I will have the first EA based on Method 1 from the BB-Stoch-ZZ approached I described earlier. Initial results looks promising, but a lot more testing still needs to be done

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Wow thanks for doing this! But just curious why not method 2? Base on your post that seems to have the better results?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Will get there as well--method 2 will take longer to get out

Looking like an UP day today. Hope you know why now

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I think it goes beyond this, RobertK. But as a non-mathematician, the glory of what "similiarity/dissimilarity" is lost on me slightly. Yes, you are describing a fractal type event and this "method" isn't the first to point this out. But this post from FXWrangler is probably more in tune with Eurusdd's original intention. I'll leave it there. Just remember though, since the start of the original thread by Eurusdd, he has been able to demonstrate initially the concepts on 2 different pairs of indicators. That's what is "unique", ie. showing the principle in action to us mere mortals. I wouldn't say it's been hyped up at all. Perhaps in terms of Forum behaviour, then yes I agree with you - as people validate the concept and then gather around discussions/questions/answers/etc then ultimately get fever pitch and excitement. But in the cold light of day, it's still just a principle.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hello, I just noticed this new thread, democracy Ralome, I have actually question about indi. I understand the reason for quasi-dissimilarity as breaking through the 300 candle range border, but I haven't noticed a clue why it has return to similarity after 24 candles? Or silly me mixed-up something after re-reading the whole 240 pages... Cheers

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hello my friend how goes your day? I agree with you and what Wrangler said. If anything, the "new" perspective it has made trading more enjoyable well for me at least. I no complaints with the better win/loss ratio either

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Very quiet today. I predicted this morning that it would be an UP day based on current ZZ swing expectation on the 1H and 15M. This could be wrong today. It's hard when a swing bottom appears in Asia so you naturally think that a top could happen today.... but if it happens very soon like it did today, then a bottom forming towards the end of the day is not going to have enough momentum to go back up. ATM there's no tool for me to make this call earlier in the day. Anyway, that's just making a daily projection. Still managed to get 50 demo pips based on 1M / 5M and 15M swings off the last bottom before London Close. I've set myself 2 targets: If I can get this demo account to $50K, I'll open another $5K demo and repeat it.... this should take possibly 2 months. If I am successful, I will top up an account and do it for real using only this technique and nothing else.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I think you will be given the win/loss ratios thus far

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Great stuff Dewey and also to Steve for doing this! I am not a big EA trader, but very interested to see where this goes so thanks, I will run this soon Thanks again - happy pipping.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
This is what my view - The zone draw on Aug 2nd extended to Aug 5th. If i trade, will consider to trade from the double top to the Sim location.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
The dissimilarity "shows up" in a candle. This is what we call dissimilarity candle. When this candle appears, it will be included in the calculation for the BB's. But after 24 candles (or whatever you set BBPeriod to), that dissimilarity candle will drop out from the BB calculation range. So that is why we return to similarity after 24 candles, UNLESS another dissimilarity shows up. Then it's another 24 candles from that point.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Forecast for today is UP. The 1H shows a potential "black hole" where a ZZTOP has formed but inside the BB and therefore unresolved. The "Black Hole" would therefore attract price into the range and either cause an extreme hi or lo. The last time this happened we saw 100+ pip ranges. Anyway, lookout for action at 1.3300 - nice number for a black hole. On smaller timeframe, have used the 15M to navigate a trade from a ZZBottom. This means it's a long looking for the next swing high for exit or stop move. Nowadays, I look for synchronicity between 1M, 5M and 15M to time my trades.... it's easier visually. This means: TF 15M Last Swing = LO 05M Last Swing = HI 01M Last Swing = LO The general 15 Minute trend is now hi (ie. I'm looking for a long if price is close to low and riding it to HI) But if I'm not in a trade and looking to enter, I will wait until the 5M posts a LO and the 1M also posts a LO. There is still a risk that it will repaint - ie. price has not finished.... but the 15M should tell me whether price is at BBMid or not, which is where I would put an SL. It also helps that there is a DS zone acting as support on the 5M tf, so also took that with confidence. Anyway, got some time this morning at work so here are the charts. Good luck and green pips (real or demo)!

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Out at 15M ZZTop = Semafor or ZigZag. Signal was also present on 1M and 5M. +70.0 pips (not 700 pips, for you newbies!)

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Condition is almost done Hopefully can trap shorts during the us session

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Took some scalping shorts off 1.328x Ralome's v.2.6 indicator is great for predicting when DS may end.... uncanily, it timed with the German news at 11am and the spike dropped for a short signal confirmation. Just exited now. Got some Buy limits a little bit lower near the Daily Pivot, let's see if they get triggered.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
2 of these have been triggered. 1 more remaining. The 15M and 5M still need to resolve to a bottom on the ZZ/Semafor. These prices coincide with Daily Pivot. I still think that 1.33XX will be revisited if not today then definitely this week. EDIT: Notice how Ralome's indicator is predicting DS start/end on the 1M and 5M... they don't always turn out correct but they help you time your visual scanning of price action. Another trick I can share based on Eurusdd's later notes.... on the 15M, notice how the amount of dissimilarity reduced to zero just before the DS zone ended. Only after that does price move away from the top, confirming it. Eurusdd mentioned that when price is at zero it will produce an extreme, as well as when the difference makes a peak. But the ZERO value is alot more reliable.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
..Good scalp trade it's been trying to break and stay above 1.3280 level for almost two weeks now if you zoom out you can see there is a problem at this level.Good luck

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Ok you bulls had your fun...time for beef!

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Black Hole anomaly @ 1.3300 cleared (Blue Line at #2 Semafor in purple). Should be safe to either keep going up or move for a ZZBottom. Given that we'll get FOMC news tonight, I'm gonna bet that prices go higher before a fall. EDIT: 162.10 pips today just on BBSTOCH method and casual usage of DS Zones and Ralome's predictor indicator. Gonna try and get some time to keep doing the 2012 full year backtest of daily predictions tonight, but I may not get this done until next week. I'm really interested to see how it comes out raw and what tweaks we can add to bring up the success rate.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
The 1H has been the best long range timeframe for seeing the resolution of longer term zones (as you can see from some of my screenshots). Overall, 1.3300 is a key level and significant sentiment has to either change or continue to move away from this range of prices. This is where the DS Zones are helping create further clarity. The zone are representing the key areas of dissent among bigger players. it's also been suggested that tick volume MFI can help visualise the entry and exit points of these players. This is a different way to look at Support and Resistance. They're not just static prices. They are a dynamic representation of supply/demand forces.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Actually price is ranging. Show us your backtest when price is trending : very usefull. Thanks !

--- 帖子 #601 ---
The backtest for the "Daily Projection Method" doesn't even need to be done. You can visually see it for the last 2 months using a 1H and Daily separation bars. I mentioned this in the post about the method: It was a bullish trend since Bernake's Bullish Bar (200+ pips I think??), therefore: Price above 300EMA, default projection should always be UP DAY. Confidence signs: Price in the upper channel of Bollinger Stoch at upper channel of Bollinger Price tends to be above or in the same angle as ZigZag lines. Retracements Counter-trend trades (ie shorts) with short-term targets. Price makes ZZTop and crosses the Bollinger Mid towards the other side of BB (this can take 1-3 days to happen) Price continues once ZZBot has been confirmed Alot more volatile if price overall is approaching or nearing the 300EMA which can act as support but that doesn't mean price won't go below the 300EMA to test bearish strength. If you look at the original thread, I did one week's testing of live calls using a more stripped down eyeball method of looking at the chart. I think I got 2 days wrong out of 3. One of those days was a draw, ie. Doji with price diff of 0.0004 Recently, I've not had the need - but I always begin the day with a projection.... a mini bias. Yesterday I was UP but I was wrong. That doesn't matter though because you still go through the StochBB method using the 1M/5M/15M resolution and then check in on the 1Hour maybe 3 times a day? So even if you're "wrong" on the daily, you can still be right on the trade. Hope that helps Here's the Demo Account, warts and all including the bad trades when I still wasn't sure of the signals and also some experimental trades where I hedge. You will note that no stop loss is used. Various reasons I won't go into now. Enjoy

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I have a pending sell at 1.33365, top of the DS Box on the 1H. This could go higher than that..... hmmm +30? Took another 44 pips from longs around 1.32920

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Interesting market movements are translating into our indicators. 1.33014 is now the top support level of a new dissimilarity zone on the 1H. Price is above it, so it can only be cleared from above unless a major whipsaw operation occurs. However, in reaching this price, it resolved a black hole in the previous swing hi/lo that I mentioned earlier today. So I am wondering whether that "energy" will uncoil itself into higher levels before a massive short. Just thinking out loud. The 4H chart is screaming for a new ZZTOP that will break 1.3345

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I'll continue to post this for those following the BBSTOCH method. Before I project "Daily Direction" for tomorrow, I noticed this on the Daily TF. The last ZZTop 1.34149was in the BB!!= Black Hole! The resulting price action moved away from it, then DS Started and it moved towards it again to resolve it and create a new ZZTop. I'm not sure whether that will be this week or the next, but 1.34149 needs to be resolved.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
The 1H chart makes it difficult to project tomorrow's direction. I want to say it's an UP Day. However, the 4H shows that a ZZTop is due. The 1H tf also concurs that a ZZTop is due. If this eventuates early in the day , then the next likely direction is down. This is what makes the Daily projection difficult. What I do know is that the Daily tf is projecting a target of 1.34149. A Bottom is needed before this price is reached. Therefore, a move south is required and could be synch'd to my feeling that a Down Day may eventuate. The 1H shows that a DS Zone can be cleared at 1.3337. If this is reached during Asian session then a southern move back to 3300 would make a great retrace for the higher target the following day. I'm going to say DOWN DAY.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Thanks Ralome, This reason sounds clear. Is there another way to finish dissimilarity before 24 candles? Any kind of agreement between stoch and price, both in relation to BB? Or dissimilarity candle forces this 24 canldes dissimilarity period? Another thing I think I have adapted latest indicator version so it can replace rv-2. I hope I did not missed anything. It was rather quick check. Attached File(s) r-v2_v2_60.mq4 26 KB | 301 downloads Attached File(s) rv-2_v2_60.tpl 145 KB | 296 downloads

Just a thought...... Can someone code the indicator to actually highlight the dis-sim candle? Might help you guys with visuals, especially when it comes to calculating where price will be one the zone has been painted.

Hi, nice effort! just to confirm it is your post 474: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...64#post6860764 1st question : different broker starts a new day at different hours. do you think that in fact the beginning hours of Aus/Japan are significant instead of a certain broker's 1st hour? 2nd question: Are below the only 5 rules you used to predict next day's up/down, or you incorporate any additional new considerations? If PRICE is above 300EMA, the default daily direction will always be UP. Other things to look for to support an UP projection PRICE is also traveling the upper half of the bollinger band PRICE closes the day near a ZZBottom and the next major swing into the new day has to be a TOP. STOCHBB is above the 50 Line Stoch is also travelling the upper half of the bollinger band​ 3rd question: for the PRICE closes the day near a ZZBottom and the next major swing into the new day has to be a TOP; both ZZbottom and TOP should happen before tommorrow (within today)? or only the TOP should happen in the beginning of tomorrow? your test results are simply astounding and incredible. it is an "EDGE" that every trader dreams for. i'll attach an EA that can amplify your deadly accurate daily prediction into ridiculous profit. Attached File(s) Crazy Daily Stacker.mq4 20 KB | 399 downloads The EA's this week performance is here: http://www.mt4i.com/users/charvoke/stats , check the "charts" tab for the equity.

Hi, I have been silently following the all the "similarity" threads, been using Ralome's "StochDifZones" indicator, and desperately trying to get some value out of all of it . Here are few observations I made so far: Most people seem to forget about one significant information that EURUSDD shared in the original thread (post #3476). If you actually apply this rule, you may observe many long-hanging zones to be in fact invalid according to the above principle. Surely, some of the good-looking ones are cleared early too, but still I believe this to be very useful. My hope is that once we account for that, it can significantly improve the ratio of only ~60% good zones rendered by the indi. I tried to analyze the differences between r-v1 and r-v2 indis prepared by EURUSDD, the only one I spotted (besides different default parameters) was use of SMA in r-v1 and EMA in r-v2. I am not sure how important might be. Ralome's indi identify the sim/dissim zone by checking the difference between MA(1) within bb and stoch(300,1,1) with its own bb. The difference must be greater than some value. That value in Ralome's calculations is: 0.0001. If you modify this value to let's say(0.001, 0.01, 0.1), then it, as expected, will generate shorter but more frequent dissim periods. Isn't the main principle of the similarity theory the fact that the data must be &gt;~90% similar? If this is true, then what we see on our charts is much less than that. Now playing with what I described in (3) and also not counting dissimilarity periods as dissimilar after they were "cleared" (1), must get us closer to the "90+% must be similar" principle. Having all of the above in mind and being a programmer,but totally new to MQL4 I took the liberty and attempted to apply some of the above ideas to Ralome's indicator : Close unborn zone and make abortion after price returns to the level where dissimilarity was first detected. Allow to define MA type (parameter: "ma_type"). Allow to define the value that differentiates between dissimilarity and similarity. Display the diff in a positive/negative way, to understand "which way" the difference goes. Please be advised that attached indi is highly experimental , and may be unstable . It contains a lot of comments and commented out code blocks. Any feedback (especially from Ralome) here or priv will be greatly appreciated. Regards!

Ok 1st off sorry I am asking this...this has been answered a few times already but I can't find it. I did have the formula written down some where but I can't find it either. Help me with this and I'll be mindful to keep it in my dropbox so I won't loose it again...of course unless I forgot the password... Ok I know how to convert stochs..post 240 anwsered it Can't remember how to convert ZZ to higher and lower TFs.......using 24,5,3 for 15m. BBs should be similar also? Sorry doing a chart "reset".Trying to make things more user friendly and stuff. Edit thanks V! Just trying to overlay the ZZ on top of each other figure I just have to multiply upwards Edit lol there is actually a MTF ZZ......

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Morning All, 15M has just posted a ZZBot inside BB = Black Hole @ 1.32916 Price may need to return there before making higher. @cfdtaleong Use 4500 min as the base. So for the STOCH settings 15M = 4500 / 15 = 300 05M = 4500 / 5 = 900 01H = 4500 / 60 = 75 24 was for the BB. But I don't know if you convert this. For the ZZ, Ive combined the use of ZZ and Semafor. If they are both similar, the turn is stronger. The setting for ZZ is always 24. The Semafor, I use default and I find they are in sync in any timeframe! Dont know why! Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #613 ---
In case of r-v1 it's forced, yes. And your update is correct, if you changed nothing else besides the MODE_EMA's

And associated parameters... not listed there, taken directly from rv-2

This bit is a feature I've removed. It was still there when Eurusdd made the EMA-mod and posted rv-2.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Right, sorry about that! Rookie mistake . Here it is.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I'd vouch you for the efforts if I could. You've also shown that you've been really reading all this stuff The idea to abort the zones ( yeah this is a sicko thread lol ) is great. This will cut a lot of clutter. However observations have shown that price does display certain behaviors at these abortion zones which could be potentially profitable also. Our biggest grapple with the zones thus far has been when and which behaviors price will exhibit at such zones. I am currently for the idea that they at least have some kind of memory effect. Without some kind of conclusive result, attempts to trade them has been risky at best in my opinion. Vlady's and others work on the ZZ methology (ZZOLOGY!)has however been able to mitigate that into something very workable. I will when I return to my platform run your indicator in tandem with ZZology and see how the game plays out if we look only at the " virgin " zones.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Thanks! Going through all posts in all threads was a pain. The amount of information is overwhelming and it is hard to dig out the useful stuff from ~300 pages. I started collecting the most useful information starting from post #1472 in the original thread into a text file, but never had time to go back to it, plus I have to go over the first 1471 posts again to search for some more gold . Anyway, I was hoping we could summarize the Similarity principles here, so we are using as much bits and pieces of information, EURUSDD gave us, as we can. Of course, this is just my opinion others may have done that already. Once and IF I am done with the summary, I will share it here, but it may take some time . Regards.

Vlady mate, I see you are in a production mode hows everything there mate "Up" or "Down" day based on Open being Higher or Lower than Close what do you mean mate. 99% of daily close is the same as "next dayz open"

--- 帖子 #623 ---
LOL 21! Good to see you mate! I've been a bit of a recluse trying this concept out. i was shattered when I wrote that. Of course Daily Close is next day's open...didn't explain that we'll. on the spreadsheet I was recording the backtest, I set the formula to UP for when Daily Close &gt; Daily Open and DOWN for vice versa. I then compare that against my projection and assign 1 for correct/same and 0 for incorrect/not same. the total is my win rate vs total days. Need to try and get this to a higher rates and a bigger sample size.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Bloody hell what a busy day at work. Targets achieved today, but Daily Projection was wrong. i may start posting the trades end of day so you can see entry and exit. i had a few TP @ 1.33334 just slightly under DS Top. higher target of 1.34xx is still in place. tired. Have a good night

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Way to go Vlady.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Very good, I was studying and testing ralome indicator. is very good, very happy with their signals, and continue working to implement it in matlab and signal that the number would double. Also started looking, or trying to know the force that is priced when producing the dis-similarity in the hope of being able to predict a little earlier, when playing this price. If someone comes up with something, would serve to strengthen this system. EURUSDD employs the volume, and some more expression to predict with some advance, the correction of the dis-similarity

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Sorry for noob question. This is only for EU and ratios are given by only the logic you presented: Daily Close &gt; Daily Open and DOWN for vice versa? thanks Result: 71.43% overall win/loss ratio

--- 帖子 #628 ---
21! Great result man!! Yep, the logic is only for EU as far as the original concept goes. ie. Similarity/Dissimilarity There was an entire thread devoted to it before posting was limited by the author. The students continued on here. The "daily prediction method" is something I came up with from one sentence the author made along the lines of... "you can predict the daily movement as soon as the day opens, usually with 1 hour". I asked him, "when does the day begin?" Answer: 10PM GMT... which really meant that his chart went to midnight next day at 10pm Laaandan. So at 11 or 12pm my time, you could try and predict the direction of the next day purely on whether it will be higher or lower than the open price. He said all you needed was on the chart..... by that he meant the template that he had devised... 300EMA ZigZag and Semafor Stochastic and BollingerBand in one window with visible 50% line That's it. But honestly... the biggest flaw in the method is how to predict a retracement. In a bull trend, if you've made new highs you and I know it will retrace at some point and normally we just go with Price Action.... with this method if a ZZBottom appears... the next one must be a Top.... but it could also create a lower ZZBottom one day extra before continuing the trend. I don't have a method to account for this that doesn't get more complicated. Anyways... that's that for the moment. Work is an absolute killer and then I'm away for the weekend so I'll see if I can drop by a few more times before end of day.

ah, thanks mate no sorry to mislead you, this were your results. I just copied that you would know what im talking about. Looking at 300 ema alone is of course disaster calling. At least one should kill the weak trades early...Otherwizze interesting idea..Im also developing something and im seaching for couple of indies which will limit my trades. Could be one attribute like this also yes. Keep on collecting

Hi Folks, Here's my view of the day. 4H A couple of days ago, the last swing was a bottom so I was looking for a ZZTOP. That should have given confidence in Longs. Looking at the chart, a ZZTOP has now printed but that doesn't mean it's confirmed. More later 1H This should be the prime timeframe to assess everything. My Daily Projection is UP. The most interesting thing is that a DS Zone has now been cleared. The top's price was 3337 which I'd already marked via blue horizontal line. That's why my TP yesterday was 3334. I also said yesterday morning that a 15M black hole had eventuated meaning it should dip to 3291 before going higher.... it did and lower which was great, you should have all loaded on LONGS which I did but I forgot to put a TP on them. Closed them around 332X i think.... That's like $4K in 8 hours... I've never had this kind of success on ONE SET OF PRINCIPLES (ie. For example, just Fibs or just S/R) So with 1H.... the cleared DS zone IN MY OPINION SHOULD ACT AS SUPPORT. This may run contrary to what has been mentioned before but clearing 3337 was important to me. I could be wrong! 15M I have put 2 buy limit orders below current price. My target is still 1.34XX (look at previous post)... which I think is the top of a DS Zone from the past. BTW.... my Zone settings are not set to 14 day expiry. I am using 35. I can't remember what set of posts, could have been Ralome's v2 posts... but Eurusdd changed his setting to 35 and I followed suit. To me, it's more realisting in today's market that you will have 35 trading days to return to that price. Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
The bigger idea of Similarity/Dissimilarity is a mind job. It's almost 1 month now but it's got promise. It's turned a $5K demo into $24K so it must be doing something right.... no use of fibs, S/R or anything else.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Vlady are your results strictly using the ZZ top/bb/stoch method or are using the stoch dif zones as well like your images above?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hey Effex, It's based on: ZZology (thanks cdfa!).... this is the timing trigger of the trading method. it tells me when to get in and out. StochDiff..... this helps to identify prices for exit, support, resistence, with greater certainty. Not CI as I just can't get my own personality into it. I find that I don't have the same sensibility to deal with its repainting than I do with a repainted ZZ/Semafor. I wouldn't say that it's STRICTLY these methods..... I would have to add that there were alot of mistakes and experiments in there as well: No SL on any of the trades.... SL added later on some. Hedging... Christ...some of these were blind luck but I wanted to understand what Eurusdd meant when he mentioned hedging... ie. being Long then hitting a DS then taking a SHORT instead of closing the long if you think long will go higher. Kind of thing. Not that I was able to do this very well.... :s Lots of fades..... it was the only way to handle the repaint. that meant reconciling the Daily Prediction and the order in which I read the charts... 1H then 15M then lower. 4H then 1H then lower.... kind of thing. What I am working on for the next weeks are: Check out the suggestions made in the recent posts, including the EA for the daily prediction method. Try and improve Daily Prediction as I mentioned in previous posts about its flaws Try and find a method for placing stoploss Document a Trading Method for the whole thing. Consider amalgamating Pivots and S/R, and MFI &lt;---- THIS I LIKE!

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Just had a thought on Daily Prediction: It needs to stop being a Nostradamus static type prediction and be more dynamic. At Daily Open (European Midnight or 10pm BST London), we can make the initial projection. This then gets a review at London Open (8am) +1H. This can then account for Asia which I have always used as a barometer for the day's action - well before I discovered Similarity/Dissimilarity.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
excellente. Its waiting for the price to come back to you. Secondly its the capping factor when in plus close it I guess.. How TP are defined and how you define the RIsk In your own time.. Good keep collecting

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Thank you sir, It's always good to get one of the "crew" to say Maybe once I start getting 1000 pips a day like Ken and Max I will re-appear! Actually... not a bad idea for a target

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Good qustions. SL not defined, but I now have a total drawdown exposure limit of $2K (so roughly 8% now, was 10% of account size). I am limiting the number of trades to 6. I am starting to use 1H timeframes to set my targets instead of 15M. My current target of 1.34XX is from 4H so that's also a first. Yes... all in good time! Laandaaan!

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Thx Vlady, GL with your next set of tests!

--- 帖子 #640 ---
4 Longs on the board. TP @ 338X, not going for the 34XX topday. SL in positive areas now. Sell Limits at 3420ish. I'll be away until Monday so no updates until then. Just another observation on Dissimilarity.... the bar that triggers it... is usually an explosive candle, a big mover. So to me, some form of volume spike must happen.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Demo Longs all closed. +71.4 Trigger is ZZTop signal on H4/H1/m15 charts. Thiscan go higher. Can't be asked trying to manage exits around the 3380 mark. Still looking for 3414-3420. Pending Sells are in place.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Ouch shorts underwater lol. On hindsight everything said long...geez what was I thinking

--- 帖子 #643 ---
If it's demo... see if you can hold on until 3414. Try and understand what this would mean with real money. In which case.... if you're underwater now, why not enter a long at the next ZZBottom opportunity. As the longs gain, it fixes your current loss to say ($1000) Once you crystalise your gain on the longs (ie. exit) immediately go short when the signal arrives --- i just gave some prices for possible entry points) and when the shorts start to gain, you've effectively hedged the underwater effect with the profits from the underwater trades. This was the kind of experiment I did with my demo.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Always great advice from you V! I should be able to hold though.... position sizes are small enough, just didn't expect ZZ would repaint having shown on 15m,1h and 4h lol "tunnel vision"

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Thanks for all the post. It facinates me that even when your daily prediction is not correct, you still managed to make the day profitable and days that were rit, you hacked in alot of pips. How do youy enter trades precisely?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hi Easy123, That was my point in one of my posts today. The projection is just that... projection. When I first started it, I actually placed the trade at Daily Open and then took whatever the result was, profit or loss. But the more you do it, you realise that in effect you are behaving like a Day Trader.... that is, you are using intraday timeframes, no question..... So the 15M and 1H must guide your entry and exit.... also no question. The "Day Projection" may provide a bias to my trades.... eg. if Day is UP, I am looking for dips to go long. The day could actually post a HIGH at 2:30PM London time.... 1 hour after NYC open.... then crash. But if I had made 50 pips on that long from the daily open (Midnight or 11pm previous day).... I am still in profit. If I saw a short signal after that HIGH and took it.... I really don't care if it took the price to below the daily close (thus disproving the Daily Projection of UP) because if I am short (triggered by the 15M or whatever timeframe chart)..... then I am winning. Each timeframe is a 2 dimensional trading landscape. You must learn to be 3 dimensional about this stuff to reconcile the conflicting signals. Hence why Similarity/Dissimilarity is an important concept. When you find SIMILARITY you can be more confident of the ensuing direction of price.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Don't worry... this has happened to me. My trading statement is there for all to see. But you have to trust that if the ZZTop has formed.... IT MUST BE A BOTTOM NEXT. Now I have 3414-3420. Current price is at 3393. You could LONG. Personally I wont... NOW (17:16PM) .... i just noticed that 15M posted a ZZT inside the BB... you know what that means.... Black Hole and price MUST RETURN THERE very quickly. So there could be some shorts now... probably profit taking. Target? Top of DS Zone on 15M at 3351 or the bottom of the unborn DS at 3369. That's still 30-40 pips. Try and find the gaps where price is attracted to go. But the amount of DS boxes forming on the 15M tells me she's going higher.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
That sound good, however is not so easy emotionaly What if you exit expecting reversal and ZZTop rewrites again itself as it was several times yesterday and today? It must retrace deeper somewhere, but where is that sure point? When these are solvet, hedging is a brillant way of solving mistakes There is also another way, for these under emotions. Bulish outlook, dissimlarity and a dip.. anter and ride till you are in profit with all your trades including the hedged one (or to nearest ZZTop ). There are many traders here, let's discuss how to handle that. Let it be a part of the system.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
If you have managed to follow this system and the discussion on principles then you will know that: DS Zones can be price attracting or price repelling DS Zones that have not materialised yet can also be price attracting or price repelling If you don't understand this... then you will be asking "WHERE IS THE SURE POINT FOR A RETRACE?" "WHERE IS THE POINT TO EXIT?" "WHY IS IT REPAINTING?" You must understand first that you don't just jump in because an indicator gives you a signal. If you try and learn to behave that way and you are a beginner then... I'm sorry to say, you deserve to lose your account. Indicators do not and never will provide 100% accuracy. Shit, we're struggling with Ralome's indicator at 60% accuracy and Eurusdd's BBSTOCH method which is only 10% more efficient than the original CI method. If you are emotional about your trading then you must not trade until you learn to accept it. Best way to learn.... set aside $100, $500 or $1000 and start thinking that you have lost it all. There is no other way to do this. If you are worried that you will lose that money then you wont trust ANY SYSTEM and you will start doing contra actions to your trade. ===================================== What if you exit expecting reversal and ZZTop rewrites again itself as it was several times yesterday and today? Did you actually analyse my trade today? Did you actually try and work out the Daily Projection yourself? Did you read the post where I mentioned how I tackle the EURUSD market every morning where I look at Daily Projection and then go lower into the timeframes? If you are reading one page of this thread and not digesting the background to this and posting this kind of question then you've missed 75% of the content. This question above..... were you Long? If no... then don't trade. If yes.... then why are you exiting? Why would you expect a reversal... this system doesn't expect a "reversal". Each timeframe has its own "reversal"... so what is a reversal? We label swing tops and swing bottoms. You can have swings in any trending market so I don't really care if its a reversal or not. I'll take a live analysis right now: 18:19 GMT. 4H Before today, ZZBottom. It's just created a ZZTOP.... this signals that price COULD GO DOWN TO FORM A ZZBOTTOM. No trade signal I just expect price to start creating scenarios for a bear bar. Things to notice: 300EMA (green line) is below price. Therefore default behaviour is Long. Why would you want to short against a 4H bar? That means 1 trade would have to last at least 4 hours? Really? The BBSTOCH is in 80/100 mode... it's long, no shorts that I can see..... but there's HIGH POTENTIAL, yes. EDIT: You may notice that I have pending sells. 2 @ 3414 from a previous analysis. 2 below which is an experiment... something that Taypot does (cheers Tay!) This does not mean a "reversal" to me. The 4H trend is bullish. A reversal is not a retracement.... a reversal is a change in trend. I don't think we will have a change in trend.... a retracement to create a ZZBOTtom yes, but not to become a bearish trend.... not until we cross the 300EMA (see Daily Projection Method). 1H Last ZZBottom is ages away. Every Purple and Orange Dot Top is a repainted ZZTOP..... so why wouldn't you have taken a long at each ZZBOT if your 4hour timeframe says it's still bullish? Why not? That means taking a Long and leaving it open for at least 1 hour. Why not? Yesterday a major zone was cleared to the upside. That is, price went to the bottom of the zone and then cleared it at the top. That means the price was rejected by bulls and price went higher. So it's going higher. Why didn't you go Long at that price of 1.3337? BTW... I traded right at that price when a ZZTOP was formed... I went long.... why did i do that? Shouldn't I be expecting a ZZBottom? Yes... but the above reasons made me think there is a HIGHER POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER PRICES. Besides 4H told me it's going higher. Target 1.3414 15M Price above 300EMA. DS Zones getting created below price, providing support. If price were to "reverse" now... it should not go lower than those 2 zones in the chart. That means 1.33007 is defended by 1.3312 all the way to 1.3350... What could you do? Short and target those prices? Then go long? Sure why not? What if you waited until ZZTOP forms and price crosses BBMID? At the moment, price doesn't look like it wants to approach the middle of the Bollinger Band... it looks like higher. When it does cross the MID, then you may want to take those shorts. But I personally wouldn't because the Ralome indicator says that a new DS Zone has just been triggered.... Green bar at the bottom.... can you tell which BAR created it? It's that big bullish candle with a bottom of 1.33696 (blue line).... so that has to be a support line..... It's all bullish to me. If I'm bullish on 15M and bearish on 4H... why don't you take two trades and close them based on their own timeframe and swings within that tf? So LONG on 15M and target the 3414 and take a short on the 4H and keep going short until you reach 3414 (my current maximum is 6 positions). Exit the 15M if you reach 1.3400 or 20 pips. You could work out the size of the Long Lots and make sure you cover this equivalent in Shorts.... so you are not "losing" Believe me, I've not traded like this before. These are all by-products of learning this system/principle. So take heart that anyone can learn to do this. ============================================================================= In any of these 3 analysis that I've taken 15-20 min to review, screenshot and type out... .you couldn't form a trading plan? Come on! This is what traders do... look for a gap, a target and go for it. If you lose you lose if you win you win.... It's unemotional. If you are afraid to part with money that you should always think you have lost already you shouldn't do this game. It will hurt more. Okay! Done! Everyone have a great trading day tomorrow.... see you all next week! Green pips to everyone!

Frankly the only part missing now about ZZology is nailing the turn. I think for trend riding ZZology and couple it with 123 waves it is rather solid. Generally we know price will return to ZZ points be they valid or not, so technically you're fine as long as you can hold. But this is of course easier said than done. To be very honest my 3 ZZs where not aligned at first and yesterday's crazy repainting made me cautious but when they painted a top together I thought that was it Edit: Now notice that my behaviour was completely amaturish. But I cite bowel irritation in my defense. Seriously do not try to nail turns like what I'm doing. I'm trying to experiment though my techniques lack finess. I am trying to recover my equity but I am also making the pips to pay for my umm experiments and this is something I'd never been able to do

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Watch 15M now. if price crosses BBMid, look for reaction at the low of the DS candle 3369.6 if it makes a ZZBOT,go long.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Thank you vlday. That was a comprehensive thought process and I understand it a lot better now. I think we should have more of such analysis than sticking to rigid rules. I see you are trading spots, are you still using the same strategy for binaries using projections?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Thanks Vlady for deep insight. I'm still reading some posts on both threads and putting missing puzzles together. Learning is a proces which never ends. Obviously I mistaken terminology since I meant reversals on abc level, so not major trend reversal, but subtrend-one, so called swing. Sorry for confusion. I have to master the system and I'm trying to catch some knowledge here and there. This hedging issue is something what was somewhere in my head for some 2 years and it was awaken by EURUSDD's hint. What you wrote makes sense and I'll probably go for trying that somehow. humble thanks.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hey Guys, Firstly, I wanna say that I really appreciate your support and welcome any insight criticism, or alternative thinking. My posts lately may have come across as a bit harsh around the edges. It's purely fatigue from work getting in the way of this which is way more fun! Secondly, I owe everything to Eurusdd for this "system" / principle and Ralome for the indicator. It's transformed my normal trading. And it's galvanised all my previous experience into a method. kind of like a cooking style. It's not important to get the exact recipe right but the spirit of the ingredients and the cooking process. Then add your own flair in it. Tomorrow I'm seeing an UP Day. but look out for any sudden moves. 1.34 will happen.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Just curious looking at your charts why is the 15m stoch on 75,1,1 isn't that for 1H and whats this mwstoch you're using? Work gets in the way of fun all the time lol

On a train so must be brief. MID Settings can be whatever you want so you can see clearly. Does not affect StochDiff indicator. Everything else is fine. I'll try and get back later. EDIT: The StochBB I am using was a combined indicator someone posted. check the Thread Attachments.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ok my attempt at this. Learning and developing a system is one thing learning to think like a trader is another. Blue fonts are factors that align and support out look, Red fonts are cautionary points, Black fonts neutral 4H, 1H and 15 PA are all above 300 EMA DS between 1EMA and stoch on 4H, stoch has to follow price upwards BHZZT (Black hole ZZ top) on 4H, price attractor DS between 1EMA and stoch on 1H, stoch has to follow price upwards BHZZT on 1H, price attractor Valid ZZB on 15 min with PA crossing mid BB. ZZT due after ZZB UBZ(Unborn zone) just formed and could be support PA has bounce of DS zone once, second test went halfway into zone. Bias is UP for now with longer term expectations for short. Edit: Push has gone deeper into zone and created an invalid ZZ within.What will this mean? Edit: Zone cleared...this is where I'm not so sure how price wants to move EDIT: Should have held yesterday's shorts........well....price of learning EDIT: Gee zone clearing. Guess I'm always right...just the wrong day lol

--- 帖子 #659 ---
In my previous amature analysis I mentioned about price pushing into a zone and what it means. I'm guess its weaking support and increasing the probality of that zone being a traget to be taken out. I could be wrong as usual lol but we gotta start learning properly somewhere. Can't expect to be a good trader just like that.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
vlady, I have made some very minor adjustments to the previously posted version of Stoch with BB, all parameters are now externals and the Stoch settings are corrected as well (the were hard coded as x,3,1 rather than x,1,1) I am still struggling with the "Daily Projection" - if today's Open &gt; Close (ie red candle), then tomorrow should be another down day if tomorrow's open is situated how or where? Lower than today's open? Cheers / Mop

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Thanks dude, I've given it a go and it gives a better picture... more clarity. just a note about this. I set mine to the 75,1,1 setting because it's clearer for me to see. if I use 300,1,1 it is just too small to see if the wave is in or out of the BB. The Daily Projection is self contained in the one Day. I don't look at todays UP or DOWN result to predict tomorrow. I use thee next ZZ Sequence. For example, the 15M has a ZZB and ended in the middle of nowhere. Next week, a ZZT has to form... unless a lower ZZB forms. If I can see that the Bollinger Band can give me a good looking Close Outside of BB on the Price and the Stoch, I give more weighting to that, than a lingering DS Zone that it might try and reach. Monday is hard. At the moment, I would look at all timeframes and I would give more weighting to the ZZ sequence of 4H and 1H. The 4H has reached BBMid... look at recent trend, its remained on top half... so I am going for that to remain and possibly form a higher ZZT. The 1H is expecting a ZZT...but look at how far away the BB border is... it has to travel higher. It has to. So I would initially mark Sun and Monday to be UP days, with a lower ZZB to form on the 15M.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
vlady, 1. I am using Stoch 75,1,1 myself, just set it to 300 in the indicator as I thought most here trade M15 with period 300 Stochs... 2. Daily Forecast - I was referring to your posts #608 and #623 - would you mind to share your excel table (you can PM me if you prefer) as I really like to explore this further (without reinventing the wheel that is...) Thanks in advance / Mop

Closed small shorts +12 from Friday. Daily Projection is UP for Asian and London. could be Down for NYC.. depends on how far she climbs.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I'll try and dig this out tomorrow. Just got back from a trip so nothing right now... Chill-axing in bed. ive mentioned before, the StochDiff uses 300,1,1 and 24 for all timeframes. The Stoch Bb can be whatever you want as long as its legible. I use 75,1,1

--- 帖子 #665 ---
So last night I predicted UP. At London Open, the market moved to clear a broker's price gap and then headed south. This to me is a clear indication that we're going downhill. I think this is a better way to make a directional "prediction" - not based on "DAY" but based on SESSION.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
1st question : different broker starts a new day at different hours. do you think that in fact the beginning hours of Aus/Japan are significant instead of a certain broker's 1st hour? I don't have a sophisticated setup for this Demo account. So everything is just a proxy for the idea.... Broker's 1st Hour is just that, a proxy. I tend to agree more with your statement of ASIA Open being significant. From my time perspective, Asia begins at 10PM British Summer Time which is 12am on my broker platform... which prints a vertical day line under the 1st Hour bar. That's good enough for me at the moment. 2nd question: Are below the only 5 rules you used to predict next day's up/down, or you incorporate any additional new considerations? If PRICE is above 300EMA, the default daily direction will always be UP. Other things to look for to support an UP projection PRICE is also traveling the upper half of the bollinger band PRICE closes the day near a ZZBottom and the next major swing into the new day has to be a TOP. STOCHBB is above the 50 Line Stoch is also travelling the upper half of the bollinger band​ It is inevitable that I add other considerations. All traders must do this. If it's too mechanical.... you will consider the method "too flawed" and look to adjust too much. You may see from my previous post that I am only making a prediction. I no longer trade the prediction (although I did in the first week of doing this). I now consider it more of a Preparation step. ​ My latest thinking is if I "prepare" by being biased LONG...... ie. predict UP.... and then something proves me wrong by the next session within the DAY, then I a have the basis for a trading plan. Right? I mean in practical terms, I'm asleep during ASIAN when I already made a prediction. I wake up and only 3 things will eventuate : I was right... therefore trade in that direction.... or I'm wrong and I don't trade in that direction.... or I'm unsure, therefore I don't trade. 3rd question: for the PRICE closes the day near a ZZBottom and the next major swing into the new day has to be a TOP; both ZZbottom and TOP should happen before tommorrow (within today)? or only the TOP should happen in the beginning of tomorrow? This is the HARDEST PART and creates the flaw. The method cannot predict time of swings. Impossible. In what you're saying, it's happened where Asia creates a ZZB then shoots to create a ZZT in early London, then Down into close of NYC. Sometimes, it keeps going lower until all you get is a ZZB in the day... and the rise creates the ZZT the 2nd day. Which is why the ZZMethod is powerful... but the daily prediction attempts to put a time sequence on it. your test results are simply astounding and incredible. it is an "EDGE" that every trader dreams for. i'll attach an EA that can amplify your deadly accurate daily prediction into ridiculous profit. Bear in mind this is not a "proven" method. I've seen systems/methods like this come and go and you must always remember that markets are living things. They learn and evolve. We have computer algorithms now. Nothing is constant.

Hi, There is a zone 1.3265-1.3275 moreless, Do you think she is going to clear it and then go for new zone around 1.34? Similar, a bit thiner zone is on M15 there. It somehow corresponds with H4 heading to the lower BB band thus aiming for ZZBot there. does it make sense? EDIT: other possibility, but to my feeling less probable is to clear that zone and head lower to zone at 1.31x, why not likely? there ispossible channel to be broken in order to make this scenario turned into reality. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #668 ---
It's really difficult to say. I got into some bad trades this morning based on that Zone on the 15M that got cleared. I thought it was going to provide support. It's an issue we've talked about before - when will it display particular behaviours? Inconclusive. The 4H shows how powerful breaking the BBMid is. Once this was done, the 1H and all lower, just crashed down. But the 4H, is still above the 300EMA, so the bearish sentiment is probably more correctional rather than Change In Trend. As it approaches the border, we should watch - probably not trade if you're conservative. EDIT: Yes, based on this move it's more likely that the zone could be targeted. The 1H is probably the one you are referring to. It does look like it's attracting price. The last swing low on the 4H was 1.31894ish... so the zone could well be taken out. I would like price to go the 1H BBMid and I would short from there. Don't know if we'll get that opportunity. The 5M shows a zone that has acted as support, so I've gone long. I want to exit and short on the 1H BBMid and target that 1H zone to clear. From there I might just remain flat. EDIT: Forgot to mention that today, the 1H opened below 1.3337, then shot back to just above it.... which is a clear seller's move. I should have read that better to be fair but I didn't take it. London's opening bars confirmed the move... a little too late to ride it. So that's why I am long (countertrend) aiming for 1H BBMid to short.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Downwards for ZZB on 4H imho. 4H broke 50 fib and pierced 60sma. Lower BB line at 61.8 now maybe that's where it will paint...1.3270ish Out for about +28 for now let see if can keep em

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Assuming that we can wait for H4 leg. Do I recall properly that Ema has to touch BB and stoch be outside of BB? Please lead me there if I mixed-up something. Edit: Dissim on M15. My view is still that we have to go up afterwards, so we shall be on the top of the box when it is born. Why? ZZBots on TFs up to H1, waiting to be formed on H4 yet Stil over ema300 Could be that good entry point will be when Stochdif shows value close to 0, if coincidenced with these ZZBots... Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Yes, it's a stronger signal if Price and Stoch are outside BB. 2 exceptions: when Stoch is maxed at 100 and min'd at 0... this could be either outside or inside the BB.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
I think I read something about fake ZZPeaks where price is outside of BB. Do I mix something up?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
LOL... that happens alot. Shit... that happened to me this morning. That also happens when all tfs are in sync. It's not perfect. But stick to the original principle: CLOSE Price and Stoch outside of Bollinger Band often signals a change in trend. The caveat is that you don't know which Signal will confirm the change in trend. However this is true: 90ish% of turns have Close and Stoch outside of BB. The 10%ish that don't are the ones for the 2 exceptions I mentioned above... when the stoch is at extreme limit.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Nice one man... better than me today. But I may get another chance. 2 longs on... and 15M DS just started right on the ZZB. After the DS ends, the next DS Zone MUST PRODUCE A TOP . This was a rule provided by someone here.... shite, terrible with names, but what he suggested works.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
And on the dayli, template provided by EURUSDD. Could redraw, sure, but ZZ leg formed anyway. Still trying to figure out. I have problem with posting the graph EDIT: uploaded at least... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #676 ---
That is an intersting observation! No trades for me for now. Gonna see what happens at that 1.3270ish level. Edit I'm using the 60 sma for tests instead as it ties in with another system

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Okay, now I see it. If you compare the Daily to anything lower than the daily, you'll find that it doesn't behave in the same way or display in the same way. The turns don't have any price or stoch outside of BB. I personally don't apply the ZZBB method on the daily as i don't think we've been provided with the right settings to get the right resolution. 4H is the maximum timeframe.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
The last swing in a closed DS Zone will produce the opposite swing on the next DS zone that has started.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
It was template from early post, #125 I also noticed, that conditions we use are not met there, however it is something interesting to see anyway, see and observe how it develops.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Closed my longs +66 pips. That's $1K back after a not-so-good morning -$3K.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
In demo or real ?

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Does cleared zone stand for resistance now?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Demo

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Which tf? EDIT: Are you refering to the 15M one? In general, no... it doesn't stop a move... it causes turbulence. There is memory around that price. So in one sense... yes, resistance from maybe a time perspective... ie how long before the resistance fades. Eurusdd was alluding to this in his later posts and his other thread about resistance bands.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
15M tf, I must read this resistance related thread yet... Vlady, one question. There was observation that trend change may happen in similarity mode only. How to treat it during dissimilarity. I haven't found yet clear answer to this except statement that during dissimilarity trend has to continue, but for example when looking at 15M tf what the trend is for it? higher TF's swing or...?

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Back home. Here's the file. Hope it makes sense.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
I debated with some guys as to the tradability of Dissimilarity in general. I reasoned that when DS starts, in reality, the zone has not yet been "Born"... and thus we came up with the pregnancy/birth analogy that we sometimes joke about. I said that you can only trade the zone that is real... when DS ends or in other words when Similarity has returned. The fact is, during the DS Start I have seen changes in trend. I have seen ZZT and ZZB happen in the DS Start Zone. When it ends and Similarity is back... I find that trend continues. But sometimes (alot less than normal) I see trend changes during similiarity. If a Zone has been born.... and price is below it, we argued that price must rise in order to clear it..... but if Dissimilarity occurred in the first place, it must mean that an arbitrage opportunity has occurred and price moved away from the BAR that CREATED DS. For price to return back to that price... then......it must coincide with a change in trend. Another DS (that produces a move in the opposite direction back towards the first DS)?

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Does anyone see that M15 dissim just ended in RV-1 and M30 dissim started in both RV-1 and RV-2?

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #690 ---
That's a "black hole" price range: 1.3310 to 1.3312, price will come back here and clear it with force.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Sorry about the ramble. It's never a direct simple answer or black and white. Trading is like that. DS = Change In Trend SM = Trend Price always returns back to what caused DS.... sooner or later.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
1H Next swing has to be a top. 15M Born DS Zone has supported the move. My longs are in play (no SL --- not that I recommend it, just trying to trade like this for a good month) Anyone notice the "black hole" prices?

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hi Vlady i saw at your statments that you talk about Gap in Price ! This is The Exact Thing That If everyone Know it Correctly can Predict Future Price 100% cause Future Price must back To Past Gaps before any Important move in the Market, That Was around 2007-2008 That i saw one Guy Can Predict the Market 100% ! but how ? When i will be More Intimate with he i Discover Some Strange things That he Reval some of Theme to me ! We Have Gaps like Black Holes in the Past Prices But this gaps Can only find by Geometrical and Mathematical Formulas Wich Show Where is The Exact Gap in Price , That guy Turn 100 dollar to 1 million dollar in less than a Year to Prove this to Everyone ,None of he's Trade werent Negative and All Hit TP ! Tp Were The Place that We have Gap in Price ,And Thats So Funny to me Some People Say Price is Random ! Maybe Price have Random Character but When We have Gap Price First Must Go Back To Gap And Then Move to Other Directions Even IF Tsunami Hit Even If We Have Nuclear Explosion In A Country! First Price must Go To Nearest Gap And Then Go To Any Other Direction . AmirShahiN

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi Amir, I certainly can't say that I can predict the market, or even know when these "gaps" will take place. But years ago... back in 1997, I met a computer programmer trader and he also told me that everything you needed was in price. Back then I never understood it but over the years I've learned that there is a form of mathematical symmetry in the movements of price.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
spot on my friend!

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Compare the first 15M posted 1 hour ago to the next one. You'll see that the swing tops occurred... but the close was not outside BB. This is an unresolved price. It moved away pretty quickly. Direction away from it wasn't important.... but rather that it would return with a vengeance. Attila in the EurUsd forum often says that big players want to create the widest range as possible before they go towards their intended direction. Kind of like stretching a rubber band away from direction, to deliver the force forwards. So the move downards on the 15M wasn't a bear move. It's an actual bull move to get a better Long Price (ie. cheaper). The 1H chart says we're due a top... the BBs are narrowing so it could be breached fairly soonish. I will watch this for clues as to when to close my longs.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
You Know Vlady When That Guy Say we Have Gap in Price and Future Prices must go back to Past Gaps and This is The Way we Can Predict 100% Future market We say that he is a lier and it is impossible , But He done it Live For a Lot of People he Start With 100 Dollar With no Sl and Only Enter The Trade When we have Gap in Market and We have Coditions For Current Price to Go back to That Gaps , What i and Other People Saw About Gaps Was Unbelivable . SomeTimes That Guy Had Position Size like 300 lot ! i Think Anyone Dont See Such a Performance like That till now and never will see Until someone Else can Discover these Gaps. That was Just Amazing Turning 100 dollar to 1 million Dollars in Few Month !

ZZBot on H4, H1, M30, M15, and dissimilarity mode. Zghall we aim for ZZTop going long? Zone Cleaed, where price will be after zone is born? I still see it upwards so we can clear upper zone and then return here. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hi, my views for discussion. Yes we are due a ZZT but the move in 15m is not right yet. stoch is not yet aligned, the unborn zone is not a "virgin" and the zone below is very hot because its been around for 11 days. I don't know how to trade this to be honest but longs should be taken carefully I believe. Just because all ZZB form does not mean a bottom. Learnt that the hard way

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi Folks, Work got in the way and I wasn't able to exit my Longs on the last 15M swing. So currently underwater. Dammit. Wanted to ride it down. But yes, I agree that we are due a Top. Good call blackqn regarding the lower zones... they've clearly attracted price. The crucial indicator to watch out for is the 300EMA on the 1H. If price stays below this line, we're in Bear territory.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Does anyone see one pregnent just below one born zone? So we need to clear born one or be below pregnant to avoid a trap. Thoughts? EDIT: M15 EDIT: I will share my thoughts and ask kindly for comments. H4: ZZBot formed, but no force to go up and form ZZTop yet H1: Born zone around 1,3292-1.3299 seems to be resistance so far, zone at 1.323 acts as a support, but it was tried several times, so it may weaken M15: new zone aligned to yesterdays one, both shall act as a resistance preventing up-move. Thus price most likely will go down And now it is going to be moe interesting... RV-1 shows on M15 sim-dissim turbulences price is trapped here, however these new zones are not on RV-2, so we shall just ignore them if I remember correctly. Anywai it somehow shows strength of 1.323, easier way is down probably still Attached Image (click to enlarge) EDIT: Another dissim on RV-1, and consolidation of price is stronger (range thiner), strong move is what we shall expect. Will it clear strong H1 1.323 zone?

--- 帖子 #704 ---
DS after DS, what is going on there? Now price is trapped indeed. It may go anywhere, which way is easier now? upper zone is oldest now, but wider, if we continue making zone on/in the szone and moving the price north that way.. wa can aim for north direction and ZZTop on H4, however the old and strong 1.323 H1 zone... what if we wait until it expires and ther renew attempt to pass it? Any chessmaster to help in solve this puzzle? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I've got to say that this is one of the hardest setups I've seen in some weeks. I can't call it. We're right on the edge of alot of thresholds... and I think the market knows it as well. 1H and 4H are callling for a ZZT. But I can see the 4H is weak. It can easily go lower. I closed my longs for a $2.5K hit. Could have been bigger.... but the move back up just wasn't convincing and halted smack bang in the middle of the born zone. If that's not indecision I don't know what is. I will sit it out. IMHO we can only trade once the market makes a decision on the direction. Anything more and we are basically gambling on being whipsawed.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Forgot to say... Very Nice Charts! It's good that you are marking the levels in Red. Zone or no Zone, those prices remain relevant.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Yeah this sure is hard...price is trapped ihmo, emas and smas are conflicted too

--- 帖子 #708 ---
The 1H shows price is now hovering under the 300EMA. It's bearish behaviour. I've not looked at the calendar but there's got to be some news or announcement that can move this thing.

--- 帖子 #709 ---

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I think that's the best way mate. Let the price and trend come to you.... you earn more in trending movements.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I would like to add my 2 cents in here... I have been studying lots of charts, staring at these Sim/DS setups. I have also been thinking about divergence, which first came to my mind when EURUSDD brought this method to light. Some others have also mentioned that this method smells of a divergence theory. So, in a nutshell, I want to present this simple look at divergence using an old indicator I have been using since its been around. This idea seems simpler and maybe a way for others to take advantage of the "blackhole theory," that don't quite understand or follow what the heck EURUSDD has been trying to explain. The CCfp indicator extracts individual currency strengths from all the major pairs, and presents an indicator of strength for each of the two currencies of whatever pair you are looking at (via settings). The picture attached shows what I mean about divergence and the "blackhole" theory as presented by EURUSDD. Using any currency and any timeframe it seems, once divergence is detected, price always (with disclaimer) returns to the highest/lowest price within the divergence zone (annotated as aqua). Because CCfp is a global basis of currency strength, divergence is a footprint of the big boys moving money into a pair, pushing price of a pair beyond where price "should be" as noted by the strength of other pairs and individual currencies, which is what the indicator shows. I've heard others say that the big boys push price away from where they would like price to go, taking out stops etc., so they can get in at better prices. I'm not sure I believe that, but it fits into what divergence shows. I have written several indicators and dashboards (with pre-alerts for divergence) scattered throughout FF that show CCfp in different timeframes, etc. But I may have to revisit them to modify for this specific theory. I will post the indicator I use (to follow), and if anyone has the time and interest to investigate further, I will do the same. Carl

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Attached is the CC-New indicator which is one that I modified slightly to use post-fixed (mini accounts-IBFX) currency pairs. Carl P.S. Set the first parameter to TRUE (ShowOnlyPairOnChart), to see as above. Otherwise it shows you all the pairs individually.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Intereresting approach! There's one divergence right at the end, opposite of those marked on the chart (should we call it a bottoming one?). As per concept, price should rise to the high of the divergence range, 0.9380 that is. Hasn't gone there yet, will look how it fares. Will study it on lower TF's. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Carl! Many thanks for this! I'll try and give it a good test. What settings are you using on your chart?

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Default settings. In actuality, settings change internally to the indicator (automatically) depending on what timeframe you look at. Carl

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Thanks. When price crosses the Bollinger Band Midpoint, the CC-New MAs crossover each other.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hmmm.... maybe it was just me, but the indicator was just oscilating around the zero axis. But I created another chart and it now looks like your chart.... apologies.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Yea, keep in mind that when you first put the CC-New indy on a chart, MT4 has to load in that timeframe for all the major pairs. So, by switching timeframes back and forth, forces MT4 to fully load all required data. Carl

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Looking at this 1-HR timeframe for USDCHF, looks like price needs to continue down to .9320 to fill that "blackhole" divergence. Carl

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Another interesting tidbit... For zigzag highs, the primary currency will always be above the secondary (for the CC-New indicator). For zigzag lows, the secondary currency will always be above the primary. So, for the USDCHF, if a zigzag high is indicated, the USD strength should always be above CHF strength. And vice-versa. So far, I have not found an instance to the contrary in any timeframe. So, if there was an instance where the above rules were not true, could that tell us that zigzag WILL repaint??? I will download that repaint zigzag indicator and look... Carl

--- 帖子 #721 ---
crodzilla - I knew sooner or later you'd come to the party with some great stuff just like you did on Al's thread. I did drop hints about divergence (and supply and demand) in previous posts as it seemed to me that a lot of great work and time and effort put in by others (vlady deserves a special mention) was very complex, when something more simple may be the place to start. Let the quest continue for yourself and those clever enough - I'm certainly not one of them.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
I appreciate it handy, but this needs to be a community effort. I have so little time these days. I hope this idea has some merit. I am not that smart either... I love EURUSDD's different look at the market. I just can't seem to put enough of it together. Carl

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Yes, this was the first pattern I noticed. I think this is a good start. The divergence (sloping of indicator is opposite to slope of price Bottom or Top) is attached to the relevant swing.... ie. 1st Currency divergence for Lower Highs, and Higher Lows..... showing a more permanent or longer term change in trend in that timeframe. Will investigate further tomorrow. Many thanks for the indicator!

--- 帖子 #724 ---

..and with info from another observation I made a night before, if GJPY crosses 151.19x anytime Thursday, then it should go further downwards for a bit..I've not yet come up with a way to tell how far prior to the event..though I'm OK at guessing as it occurs. All this hypothesizing is fun!

Godmorning, could you please say us which parameter use two ZZ ind. ( two of them ) Bülent.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I think the settings have to align to the timeframe. The Minutes should be set to BB of 60 ie. 60 minutes and then you can experiment with multiples of the 1M, 5M, 15M etc. ie. 60/1 or 60/5 or 60/15... then further divide into 2 or 4..... or multiply by 2 etc. The Hours should be set to BB of 24 for 24 hours... etc. 5M is set to 48, BB of 60. 15M is set to 12, BB of 60.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
they are 3 and 10, but here is principle how to use stoch/zz-&gt; http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...55#post6800755

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Here's a live test. EDIT: Should be 5M ZZ/Semafor has formed a "3" ZZB but the Stoch hasn't reached Zero yet. Therefore it should go lower and repaint.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Dear VLADY1974, İf posible could you share your last chart template? Best Regards. Bülent. Not ; Thanks your help YOU and JUHANİMİ.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Anyone caught the move down? To tight a stop else would have gotten it @Vlady : you mention 12 and 60 BB for 15M is the 12 stoch settings? @the rest of the nice people using ccnew and have posted their charts: are the divergences manually drawn?

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Well, for transparency sake, the GBPJPY trade has exceeded its previous high... maybe by setting to breakeven after 1/2 of the target is met, this might be avoided. But, on the other side of the coin, how many trades will be whipsawed into breakeven just to eventually reach the target. It would depend on your risk... I never liked Yen crosses due to the BOJ manipulations... But, I guess all the banks are manipulating currencies these days. Carl

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Yes I did! The stuff posted by Crodz and Juhamini are providing more insight into the ZZ swings. The only downside on that trade was that I set some buy limits at the bottom of old zones.... 3 are underwater atm but the last one has swung into profit. I guesstimated that the ZZB would kick in on the 1H and my new StochBB is flat on 0 so I'm setting up longs for tomorrow. I'm basically gambling on a double bottom on the 300EMA on the 4H. Lower StochBB setting: 24,24 (see post below)

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Let me try and do this from home tonite as my VPC is acting like a right royal pain in the ass at the moment.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
12 is stoch. I'm experimenting with different values. I think I've changed this to 48 now. Basically it's what I said before.... the Minutes are based on 60 minutes. The hours must be based on 24 hours. So a timeframe must be divided or allocated into the base time unit. For the 5M = 60 divided by 5M = 12. Set the BB to 60. For the stoch I used 12... the "repainting effect" comes out as a flat line on 0 or 100. That's not really much to go by in terms of understanding whether the swing is the last swing. So I go higher in multiples of 12. 12/24/36/48/60. Right now I've got 48 in the Stoch I have a separate sheet for each TF so that I can set this indie up with different values according to the timeframe. For the hour, it's obviously different. 1H = 24 hours divided by 1... 24! So that is my Stoch Setting. The BB Setting is also 24. Your aim is to be able to get a ZERO stoch value for the ZZB and a 100 for the ZZT. If you're getting Zeros for all the other bottoms and 100s for the tops then that means your indie is not filtering out the insignificant fluctuations. The interesting thought is that the extreme is ALWAYS outside of the Bollinger Band.... which is probably how Eurusdd came up with that rule in the first place

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Good for you man. Yes ZZology is just getting better by the day ain't it thanks to everyone.Spotted a divergence prolly one of the reasons for the rally

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Share share!

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Hats off to Juhamani for the re-post. I like the fact that we're using the same indicator to check another indicator in the combined list of indies. Just goes to show that the Similarity Principle can really make use of standard indies if you get to understand how they work.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Yeah this would really help in the assessment if a ZZ would repaint or not, which is one of the biggest nemesis of ZZology. It won't be perfect for sure but with CCnew(line position, crosses etc) and basic/hidden divergence knowledge we can make a good guess of which behavior a zone is going exhibit(target or s&amp;r). Add it all up and we can plan really sound trades I believe. And thankyou Mob for the bb stoch indi.its way better than the stock version.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
You're so right. Without these new pieces, I'd still be scratching my head today. Overall the market is still undecided and "flatish" - whipsaw country. But with these indi setups I have more confidence picking a direction and sticking with it. (Closed 2 longs at BBMID going to see if my TP is hit with the rest)

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Thank you very much. Bülent.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Thanks for the agreement! Lets me know if my head is on straight I'm guessing you will first tighten stops when the stoch hits 100 and consider exiting when the ccnew crosses? If that does not happen you'll ride it to the other band?

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Haha.. I was getting impatient... end of day I guess. So all closed. Friday tomorrow so not sure if we'll get any more surges.... could be wrong. Lunch time at NYC.... Anyway, you're trading idea is great. I didn't think of that. See you are thinking like a trader! And guess what....1H shows were' right on the 300EMA.... again . We need to break out of this price range to really test these indies.

Just home after an exciting day...on the GJ trade it seems price at least breached the high of the lowest candle of the divergence period..that should be significant enough in my opinion. Theres nothing that negates the notion that the concept is concrete enough to trade, perhaps with a few safeguards. I might need to look things over some more, but now its time to sleep.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Something I've not done in a long while is trade related pairs to EU. The CCNEW indi provides a good insight for reminding me of another similarity indicator between the crosses. Just scored a modest 20 pips on UJ long just as I shorted EU. From chart, the CCNEW shows E and YEN are in sync against the dollar. I'm bullish on EU but you can see that EY may go south and drag down EU whilst UJ strengthens.

Hi FFpips, As a matter of course I would check higher timeframes then drill down. Your chart looks like a 15M? Below is a 4H chart. It's due a ZZT so that requirement overules all smaller timeframes and would need to do that at lest at 1.3390 or above. The 1H shows a ZZT but the Bollinger is on a weird vertical angle so the chances of a repaint are high. This is harder to project. It could produce a ZZB with price producing a very tight range until the BB contracts together... it would technically be still a bottom. Or it could drop massively as you project... but that would mean it's a retest of the 4H ZZT but not producing a new low... difficult. There would have to be an amazing piece of news to drive back to 1.32 The 15M and 5M are all going to be reflections of the 1H..... but the 1H at the moment is in limbo at exactly where you entered. I am long from there. You can see that I have pending buy limits below that..... some would say catching a falling knife... you could trade it the other way as well.. by shorting and adding but the catch is that if the drop doesn't take out the 4H ZZBOT... it's going to be a very very very quick reversal within the 1H and shorts may be whiplashed. My opinion: I'm long... but for a 5M -15M timeframe you could scalp that short to a 15M ZZB. That could make me underwater but I'm chasing a target on a higher timeframe so I am fine to have that drawdown - see what I mean? Unfortunately I can't comment on the CI as I'm not that good on it. What makes the higher CI different to the lower? The higher has already indicated a bottom? Final comment... the EU's lagging trend could be explained by the activity on the UJ and EJ pairs.

Wanna get over the $25K barrier. It's a psychological one. Just need $210... 21 pips Long at 1.3329, based on 5M chart.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Thanks Vlday.... My intention was not to scalp. I was looking at a full trade, spotting the divergence I thought the price was going to test the start of divergence and this was clear in a stretched out 5M chart but didn't look at higher TF. Your thought process had more weight and aligns with your previous chart drill down post. next trade I see, I will post another chart to see if I am like you.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
that's great, man. always do that. It's more of a trading habit that aligns itself well to the Similarity Approach and more importantly the ZZBBoology method. You can't catch a beat if the swings don't synchronise on all timeframes. The Minutes and Hours work nicely with a framework of 24 hours. This is why I've discovered you can't use the same "logic" on Daily and Higher because the time scale is different. ie 1 month = 30 or 31 or 28 or 29 days...errr which one? 1 week = 5 days. But 1 month = 31 days or 4 weeks? Hours and Minutes though are more universal. So when you pick a time less than 24 hours.... you must go to the highest logical chart. To me that is the 4H. You could use the 8H chart but then you are 4 bars worth of analysis and the pip entry on that is ridiculous! (imagine the SL!!) So a 15M is the happy medium.... and as a result there will be forces above it (30M, 1H, 4H) that always need to be evaluated as well as those below it (10M, 5M, 1M) If you keep it to quarters and halves then 1M, 5M, 15M, 1H and 4H are all you need for the ZZBB method.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
4 Longs in play. Lets see what next week brings.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ok as shown in the picture of my 15M there are two targets a and b. My question is which one first? My 4H show we have a ZZT that repainted thus we are due a ZZB so the longer term bias is short. What confuses me is the 15M, will it create an extra swing?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Nice to see U Eurusdd .... when will you give new lesson ? Let us know .....

--- 帖子 #779 ---
EU will swing &amp; AU will go down ????

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I think it will go down first and reach point (a) , then swing upwards to reach point (b) .... may be EU will swing on next monday .... i hope ...

--- 帖子 #781 ---
I hope so too but the move whichever way it goes will be a good lesson Edit referencing my last picture there appears to be a bullish divergence forming

--- 帖子 #782 ---
The 1H is an interesting thing, mainly due to the last swing high. It is a lower high than previous high It closed inside the Bollinger Band, causing an unresolved price vacuum...Black Hole It lingers along 1.33337 which is the line that needs to be broken convincingly for longs. The last swing low is in a DS zone that needs to be cleared. The 4H shows that the swing lows have previously been on 1.31894. So if 1.33337 is broken, I will look to short at the next opportunity towards this target.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
15M also has a black hole.... marked with vertical blue line. Low of 1.3310

For Panamike Try the StochBB first One of these does have a glitch with the colours. I use StochBB the most.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Vlady, Do you consider vacuum resolved? The price did not reach there but it was almost close to the previous ZZ top. Also, I see that 1.33337 is broken in ASIA session. H4, waiting for ZZ top ?? No cobb by price and stoc - Long H1, ZZ painted a bottom - cobb satisfied - Long M15, Confused. I think the ZZ top will repaint but might need a swing low to get there. M5, ZZ top, cobb satisfied waiting for a bottom to test 300 EMA to take long.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Excellent analysis and charts! Let me give you a fuller answer when I get to work. Vacuum unresolved at 3379.4 I'm building longs.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Agreed, you guys are doing great work, vlady!

Ah! That's encouraging.

There will come a day when I do this full time when I don't have to do this in between the can, the shower, the grooming, the lunches, the commuting. Long @ 26, 30, 35, 39

High of 3385, black hole resolved. All longs closed: +404 pips

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hi FFPips This morning's London open fully justifies why I always look at higher timeframes and how the ZZBB method is profitable if understood and then tailored to your personality. Merely following the ZZBB is like hiring Jean Paul Gautier to design you a jacket that is £1mill worth but doesn't fit. It just doesn't work that way. So you are correct with the direction of your arrows: H4 was due a ZZT... it has one now. Note, I find it difficult to find a ZZB that repaints on the 4H close. H1 was tough... it kept repainting. This actually was good because from a non-Similarity point of view, ranging market consolidates in a tight range. It forms triangles or tunnels and other whatnot.... so from a trading point of view, it's a breakout scenario no matter what price level you choose... it doesn't need to be from Similarity Principles. But SM did provide a target. That Unresolved Price of 3379 was attempted and failed at 3374. Many wanted to short but failed because 3312 and 3326 were strong levels. And how could the 1H create another ZZB when the 4H ZZB was already established. Probably the biggest help to me in evaluating the 1H was the Daily Projection Method (see my previous posts). I don't use it now to trigger trades, but I still check for the signs.... and the 300EMA is the biggest indicator. Where is price in relation to it now? It's above. But it did dip below and that caused confusion no doubt about it. When it did dip, I employ another trading tip called One Last Kiss.... it means that price never travels in straight lines and if it breaks a barrier it wants to return for one more kiss at that level before continuing. I've called this a few times live and it works 7/10 times. (Never when Bernanke spoke ) In this case, not only did it dip then go for one last kiss... it kissed and cuddled back over the 300EMA.... that's when I knew the unresolved price had to be taken out. It wasn't gonna take minutes or hours... but days to play out... 4 days actually if you go back to the first real top (purple spot) COBB just to the left of it. Minutes I've always thought that minutes had to be evaluated differently from hours. It's a different fractal level. Hours refer to base 24. Minutes refer to base 60. Your chart showed ZZT... tops looking for a new swing bottom. The fractal nature of this is that if the 1M, 5M and 15M produce a deep enough low..... it will create a synchronised ZZB on the Minutes AND the 1H.... That was the key. Thankfully Eurusdd and one other gave me the right price for the base. I was struggling with this slightly. I had 3305ish 3313ish... But 3326 was the magic number. Can't recal which timeframe but I saw it was the TOP of a DS Zone. Perfecto. Okay... that should do it. Hope that helps. P.S. Notes on trading style My trading style has changed slightly in that I don't worry too much now about drawdowns because of the account size. I play with 2 lots now. It's a form of fade. So I don't wait till price is at extreme then enter. I get near and enter and continue to enter until it swings back. I never used to do this. I guess this comes with cash (demo) and confidence. The ZZBB method helps me time the market... I don't chase it. If I see an opportunity and it's in beat... i take it. If I take 20-70 pips I look to cash my chips until the Semafor changes to *3*. If that signal appears on all timeframes.... I AM OUT. 50 pips * 2 lots = 100 pips. If I have 3 of these then I don't have to try and make as much and stress out.... and ultimately that's what it's all about... reducing stress and increasing confidence.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Actually you're right! I keep looking at the net side and forgetting I'm on 2 lots! LOL

Cheers matey

--- 帖子 #796 ---
You are an awesome trader friend. So gonna get a relaxing beer or gonna start building the shorts

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Thanks mate. I don't mean to be modest... but I'm not yet. This is still demo but it has taught me some mental lessons. I am treating this like real money. But it's always in the back of mind that it's not. The real test I can think of is to repeat it. I have 2 targets: Double this demo account to $50K Create a new demo with lower amount $1000 and turn into $10K If I can do that before by 31st Dec 2013, I will open an account of £5000 sterling... possibly more and trade it live. So as of 31st July, I'm on a 6 month apprenticeship

--- 帖子 #798 ---
In another thread there was a brave Oz soul. He was very confident in his paper trades and planned on doing 11 trade live run. He closed the shop after 2 live trades. He did not loose his account (only 15% was lost or $35-40). He started fretting about quality of his live trades and then quit live trading . At least publicly he said so.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Great result buddy ..... got good lesson from you ...

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Live is always a different kettle of fish. Broker requirements as well creep in - especially in draw-down situations And emotionally, there's no comparison. But I think even if I was 1/4 of the bravado of the current demo account, then I'd look to at least a 1% gain a month as a target. That's modest and doable. Compounded over 12 months and I would quite my job.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Here's some high level views of 4H and 1H. Not sure if it's appropriate to tie in Elliot Wave counts (of which I am NOT an expert at all) but it's curious about the count from the last swing bottom.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
So im thinking we are all due a ZZB on the TFs...it the sudden 50pip spike I dun get

--- 帖子 #803 ---
The 50-100 pip spike was expected when price went low at 3327. 3327 + 100 pip ATR = 3427

--- 帖子 #804 ---
hmm I still have much to learn

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Update: High 3451 Swing Low 3327 = 124 pips... that is a typical ADR on EU.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Still short. That High of 3451 is forming some black hole type formation though. May use the 5M to exit out of some shorts and put on some Longs for a TP target of 3474ish. I'll keep my lower shorts as the 1H is begging for a ZZB that should capture my shorts.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Hello VLady, Thank you for the detailed analysis, I appreciate your time and awesomeness. I was in at training class the whole day and my PST time zone kept me away from the trade. I got a notification on my cell phone about your detailed response and I was getting impatient to read the post but couldn't. Do know that your opinion matters as someone who has proved to be successful at similarity.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hi FF, The 4H and 1H are now looking bullish. The push to 345X made me look at the 4H again and your arrow is right. A ZZB is due or a *2* swing at BBMid could occur. The 1H is now above the 300 EMA and price tends to stay at the top half of the BB. Which means turns occur more frequently at BBMid. I'm now building longs with a target of 3470-80 ish and loosed my shorts as too much effort to hedge. If I had more screen time in the next 2 days I would have held them but FOMC is coming tomorrow. So I've closed the long term shorts and focused on short term longs if that makes sense. Yet I remain bearish. ive longed on your 5M ZZB EDIT: 5 and 15M point higher which means 1H could repaint. If not, Bollinger Band pulled tighten and price close outside of BB to the right which would still be a ZZB but not as low as you would have thought... Meaning higher. Same for 4H. The shape of BB can help you project direction of price.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Its going to be an interesting day but again I can only snatch a quick look at the markets. Fundamentals are going to drive this around, Abe is talking about more QE for jpy, Greece needs another bailout and then on top of that the Fed. Good luck guys and gals! Vlady, some great posts, I'm amazed that some of the predictions I've made looking at the zones on my chart have actually happened (although I haven't been able to trade as I don't use stops and usually trade for real in small lots) so looking forward to getting back here when I have the time.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
If i can put in a different way, It is bullish because though 4H stocBB is at 100 it did not COBB but price did, so for stoc to COBB, price should head up or make one SEM 2 bottom and then SEM 2 top???? 1 H formed a SEM 2 at mid BB. I think it will repaint till a SEM2 forms on 4H and then a SEM 2 Top for 4H Cobb to go short. did i make sense?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Vlady, What is the definition of black hole? I looked at earlier messages about the system, but unable to figure it out?

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Gosh I love/hate mornings for trading. It coincides with my work commute and I have to revise previous night forecast and then re-look at the price action after Asia. And I closed all shorts that were taken right where the bottom is now. Bah! And I closed a big short from the top! bah bah bah. Took my longs from 20 and 05 but now got another at 92 but kids that was NOT THE WAY TO TRADE this morning's PA.... i know better. Nothing to do with Similarity but the Frankie open is, in my opinion, a long setup that continued to London. Basically big previous day's shoot up.... consolidate sideways via Asia (they place longs with big stop loss under the price that started the move (3326) for example.... everyone else wants a better "buy" price that lowers the price to 3395ish where the second push yesterday began (hence my previous post to you about the 4H). So how it looks is a horizontal consolidation with a spike DOWN before a continuation of the 2 big pushes upwards. This move clearly shows up on the 1H where as I mentioned above, the Bollinger does a squeeze..... and when it posts a ZZ swing, technically it will be a bottom and then we are away. BAH! LOL.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Yes. Personally I always look for the SEM3 for the turns... but they also turn into SEM2 so you're right to not ignore them. Yes, 1H formed a SEM2 at BBMid so that's a queue.... but I want that 1H to print a SEM3 ZZB and then the Minutes and 1H will tie. Since 4H is out of sync, but 1H has bottomed out... it can only mean a SEM2 higher than SEM3 which technically will print a new SEM3 or a Higher High on the 4H..... see what I'm looking for?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
A "Black hole" is a price formation that creates a Top or Bottom inside the Price Bollinger Band. Since the technique calls for Price to Close Outside Of Bollinger Band (C.O.B.B.) before it turns and coincides with the ZZ &amp; Semafor indicator, then a price close that is inside the BB is unresolved. That is, big players made the move too suddenly the market reacted away from that dissimilarity but once the market cottons on to the arbitrage opportunity, it will close it - ie. the market joins in and price returns to the point of dissimilarity and resolves that price . I've had about 3 experiences of this in the last 2 months of studying it. 1 of them with real money early on and I did not pay heed. That's why I remember it very well

--- 帖子 #815 ---
I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't work today

--- 帖子 #816 ---
This is the interesting problem posed by the 1H today. I think there's more upside hence my longs but I am bearish = conflicting views! Aarrgh! It could bounce early and take the high for a nice short setup. Or it could go lower then bounce and create a lower high which is a more secure setup. Or... FOMC could blow me out the water.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
vlady1974 Hi mate, you really need to be careful holding so many lots open!! MM is key to being successful.... How many lots do u have open? Once the holiday period is over we should start seeing trends again.... Anyway just a warning mate good luck P.s I believe we will see more upside, PA will tell us GL

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Mate, thanks for keeping me honest! You're absolutely right. Gonna tone it down. LOL... too embarrassed to tell you how many lots they are!

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Hi Dewey, how is this strategy going for you

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Two more days of training () Anyways... looks like all my projections got washed out yesterday. Today, 4 H looking for a bottom. 1 H bottom will repaint. 15 m and 5m bottom will repaint as well. So, 1 H is near 300 EMA and very close to form a bottom, I will wait to take a short term long and as soon as 4H forms the purple top (there isnt much room though) then take a long term short.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
My bit on the born zones... 1)If it is the first time price goes to it and a COBB ZZ paints on it, usually price will bounce off it.Set stop to BE when possible if trading this setup as you don't know how far price will run and adjust it as price goes along to lock in profits. 2)Price approaches the zone in the due ZZ direction but the 1ema and stoch still has room from the BB, good chance the zone will be taken out. 3)Price bounces off weakly, be cautious and expect the zone to be taken out gradually. 3a)Price pushes into zone but come out again without clearing it. 3b)ZZ COBB paints inside zone. Expect repaint and gradual zone clear. Suggestions from me and they are subjective

--- 帖子 #822 ---
What is COBB?where can I learn these shortcuts?

--- 帖子 #823 ---
It means "Close Outside Bollinger Bands". If you read the thread it's all there in black and white on post 814.

Hi All, Just came back from a holiday with the Mrs. All refreshed and ready to go. I've decided I will create a separate trading journal and a new demo account to start afresh and keep it separate from this discussion which I hope will continue to explore the Similarity Principles and new techniques to make use of the concepts. I'll still be around.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Welcome back vlad - we missed you.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
I tell you what, it's a great feeling not seeing charts etc for a total sum of 4 days and 5 nights. I'm looking at the 1H chart in an almost existential way.... it makes it really easy to read. Recharging the batteries is highly recommended

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Thanks Handy! It's good to be back. No trades today... just easing in. The 1H chart is interesting. It may be worth not trading this week folks. We're on the knife edge of UP or Down as the 300EMA dances right on 1.33337 where I said last week(s) that it's the key line in the sand. Never mind that it's a magic number 1 and 1/3rd and all that....

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Things to note : Price has been returning to the vicinity of 1.3400 and often with force. Big boys loading bullets, market manipulation blah blah blah, come up with your own conspiracy theories. Painted ZZs are very important. Always check the EMA vs Stoch for a difference in position. These are not always picked up by the indicator but price will almost always return to it .

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Well, this idea didn't seem to attract much attention, probably because it was not using one of the indicators outlined by EURUSDD. Well, I have not been able to get this concept out of my mind which led me to re read the original thread from the beginning to see if there was something more to grasp that could have been missed. And there was, the Stochastic method, it was not even touched by most because of the watch time and too hard to look and see the differences in the two stochastics. I think this Stochastic concept which EURUSDD introduced has significant and unrealized potential if all the time frames would have representation. Example: Stochastic settings 1 min = ? 5 min = 900,1,1 15 min = 300,1,1 30 min = 150,1,1 1 hr = 75,1,1 4 hr = 37.5,1,1 ? daily = 18.75,1,1 ? By combine these settings in an indicator to identify Dis Similarity across all time frames on one screen. What do you think? I think this would be the best and easiest without full disclosure of EURUSDD's complete secret method that we could hope for.

--- 帖子 #832 ---

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Good to see this is still being discussed. I think we should try and model out how best to visualise or visually represent what a DS actually is. I personally would be more in favour of a DS that is consistent across all the Minutes and Hours with the min of 5M. ie. 5M/15M/1H/4H.... if a DS only exists at 15M max (both 5M and 15M) then the indie painted blob should only appear on those timeframes. if it is across the board, then the blob would exist on the 4H, 1H and minutes whenever you switch tfs in MT4.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
I think 1500 is used. But that effectively takes it down to a resolution of 3 mintues not 1 minute..... but represented on a 1M chart, if that makes sense. Could be a "good enough" value otherwise you would need to put in 4500. 4500 is the basis of all of it. 4500 / 15M = 300 which was the 1st setting used. You can't use the 18.75 in a stoch so Daily analysis and above are also out of the question in terms of precision (ie. probably needs another indicator).

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Thanks, for the point out, I thought it was 4500 from some other post but in keeping with the math this makes more sense.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
I don't think you would have a blob using this method of finding Dis Similarities because the zones could be identified in the stochastic indicator window with a dot, arrow or a line. Similar to Ralome's first indicator without painting the screen. Also, it could be limited to certain time frames to analyze like 5,15,30,60 min or 15,30,60,240..... a minimum of 4 tf's would be best. As far as being something proven or unproven it was recommended by EURUSDD as a viable tool to use with as he claims, a 90% method with only 2 time frames. I hope someone with skill would take the challenge to at least see if this proves to be a better or more accurate way to identify these zones.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hi Guys, this thread has gone quiet which is a shame, but I have now moved house and ready to check this out more. I have been doing things a little differently and have built indicators for Prorealtime that record a slight difference between the movement of the MA1 and stoch. I don't bother using these on any chart but compile them into one indicator that I have called FIGHT that gives a score of 1 for each disimmilarity and adds them together. This works as a bar chart below and during trading I sometimes see it flash up to a high number then it may disappear or stay. It can't be backtested as it disappears but it can be set to trigger a warning alert. This indicates a fight/reversal to me as there has been a sudden disimilarity across many stoch values (such as 1,3,5,15,30,60,120,240,480,960). I certainly don't ignore it. If there are no bars it marks a trend and I can relax. Simple and effective! I have also built diff dissim zones to appear one chart but its rather simple as only the last zone shows for each stoch value until it changes. Zones seem to form supp and res quite well. You can just see one on the image attached but on some charrts there are a few and if they overlap they may be more relevant. Old zones, whether completed or not, don't show if a new one forms for that stoch value. I haven't paid much attention to these zones yet but FIGHT works well Reckon one of you MT4 coders can build the Fight MT4 easily. i have attached an image of a tick chart. You can see a position that i have just closed most of because a high spike shot up a couple of bars back (NOW DISAPPEARED) and the market reversed. I was able to close at the high! What an edge. I am now looking at using the CCI instead of stoch.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Grats on the new place. Will be interested to see how well cci works on your platform. For mt4 it works wonders for some while for others terribly

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Hey Taypot, hope this works out for you. Perhaps when you get the CCI working just right you can teach that baby to me My Attempt #2 on ZZBB has been quite dramatic and showing up my poor trading skills . Just survived this morning's mega whiplash move. LOL Anyways, hope your well mate. Congrats on the house move. We're undergoing a renovation ourselves on a property we hope to sell.... almost there but major cause of stress. Cheers bro!

Hi, I am new here and believe me I got fully confused about this system and finally I didn't understand how it works and who tells the truth . Please somebody tells me how should I trade using this system, which time frame and a list of indicators and the template file please. I really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hi SAMKing If you want to understand the system you have to sign the declaration of practice or a declaration of .waste of time.......This is a not a system, this is a knowledge of technical analysis which belongs to the theory of market contradictions.Years ago eurusdd present the similarity principle which governs the price action of different stochastic process.All these trading systems are developed by the principles of similarity. Eurusdd start 4-5 threads and there is no single post can tell you what it really means.All these information's are helps to develop their own system and so many people developed their own system and gone.Now all those threads are in recycle bin but information's are really valuable.If you have time i suggest you to read the similarity system thread for your better understanding.first 30-40 pages and then you can start from p-286.You can download indicators and pdf from top right corner paper clip.Hope it helps.One question-are you Sam KING or QUEEN? Good luck and Happy new year.

This is my first post. I noticed that Semofor 3 will always appears at extremes. My thinking is this. If we see a Semofor 3 at lower extreme we can initiate a buy order much further above the level where the dot appears. If price did not go up but goes further down trade will not be executed. We cancel the order.If trade can executed we know that price will continue to move up until it reach the other extreme. Of course on the way up the price will zig zag all the way meeting semofor 1 or 2. close our buy trade only upon another semofor 3 appears. It might takes us days or weeks but I think if we are patient this should proved profitable. You can trade small lot size without stop loss or take profit level. Rationale for no stop loss is that semofor 3 may move further down then the intial 3 dot but will eventually kick in when a new lower low is reached. Once trade us excuted at new lower low most if the time it will begin to move up.

Hi Joe, I know this is old enough, but accidentally i read your post above ... i missed this one. Could you please tell me which thread do you mean that uses 2 stochs ? I just know that there is just one post explaining about 2 stochs: @H1 / @M15 at Sim thread, nothing more ... Any information will be really helpful. Thanks in advance. edit: may be do you mean something like using custom indicator, so calling the stochastic is not like the normal way using: iStochastic, but we call to custom indicator like using "iDoubleStoch" ?
