RBA Strategy The name of the strategy evolved over time. I shortened it to a more conventional name for easy reference. August 19 Update The strategy has been modified slightly. The underlying principle of ADR bands remain the same. For full details about the new updates, read here , here and here . Do not post until you have digested the threads connected. We now focus on H1 and H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Introduction To all traders, this thread is dedicated to a developing project the community (Robots4Me et al) have been working on. This thread is not for newbies. We will not entertain newbie questions. Make sure you have strong money management skills before you try this out . The market is unpredictable and it can swing against you by a thousand pips. This thread will only help you to identify buy and sell zones. It is not a magic method to become wealthy. Robots4Me has been generous. He worked tirelessly to develop the indicators and EA. The rest of the community have been testing and giving quality feedbacks. Purpose of thread The purpose of this thread is to use the tools, and provide inputs for developing the tools to finished product. Market situations may change and the method may fail. So be careful. I am not here claiming to know everything or to have spent 1 million hours of screen time. Share your inputs and let's grow together in knowledge. All ideas are welcome. When posting your screenshots, please remove all other indicators. We want clean charts. Only the indicator designed specifically for this thread is allowed. How it started The project started here . The 2 main threads linked to this project are: MM (Money Maker) Detective Indicator (Start from 3865 ) Custom Indicators for TMA-ADR Reversal Trading and BBMA ( Get the latest indicators and EA here ) I strongly advise that everyone goes through the threads to read about the history of the project and how far we have come with development.

Anyone that can code should be able to do this easily. Grab a centred TMA and follow the following steps: Draw the center line of the centered MA ( NIH Centered TMA , Interpolate = false, W1, half length = 1) Mark the ADR distance from the midline Check if the daily candle pokes and closes above the ADR from the midline (Check this at end of day) If step 3 is true, trade towards the midline Repeat step 1-4 once everyday at end of day (open of new daily candle) TP: Midline SL: x% of ADR distance from trade open price (I prefer 200%) Attached Image Indicators and EA Download the Latest Indicators and EA here Indicator Disclaimer: This indicator responds to price movements. Therefore, the bands may slightly shift during the week. However, entry conditions often remain in place on D1. As long as you stick to scaling your trades from D1 signals, you will be fine. Avoid LTF until you understand how it works. Rules Entries: Don't put all your eggs in one basket : You can scale in your trades as the signals show (Avoid LTF) Split your lots into pieces. For instance if all you want to put in to a trade cycle is 0.1, then split to 0.1/6 = 0.016 (pls is this even possible? Pls let me know of a good broker who can offer small lots) As each signal appear, take the trades at (Expected total lots/6) Set stop loss as 100% ADR. Each trade with it's own stop loss. The chances of price dropping another 100% ADR before retrace to midline is really small. Less than 5%. Would probably happen on black days (market crashes). Our stop loss will save the day Take profit at the midline Mobile stop loss and take profit We will have both hard stop loss and visual stop loss. Same for take profit Hard stop is the one set at the beginning of trade which ideally shouldnt move. Visual stop is the one the EA will execute based on price vs opposite bands and midline At the start of new week, new lines gets drawn. Here is the trick. The midline could immediately become a visual stop loss. If the midline is now below or above the price, ideally, we hope price will continue moving in our favour. However, if price reverses back to the midline, we get out of the trades. That's not a really good sign. The midline is our knife edge. If price touches the midline, either in profit or loss, exit Alternative approach is to use the opposite band as exit. In a buy trade, the upper band is exit. In a sell trade, the lower band is exit. Anytime price touches the bands, relative to the position we are trading (buy or sell), we exit Our stops and TP are therefore mobile and dynamic, responding to price movement and market structure. However, the stop loss placed at the beginning of the trade shouldn't move (I prefer to leave it there. I already estimated my risk before taking the trade anyway) Money I wouldn't trade beyond 0.01 if I don't have at least $10,000 on at least 1:100 margin Best, switch to a cent account. You will get enough room to play around Trade spacing Make trade spacing selectable. This is the distance between trades. We don't want to cluster all our trades on around the same price. This will provide some relief when we are in the grief of a falling knife. Trade spacing is defined by pips and should be a % of the ADR So if ADR is 100 and I am using a trade spacing of 25%, it means that I will take the next trade signal only if the signal appears at least 25 pips below the last trade. So trade spacing is based on pair ADR characteristics. I don't have a crystal ball So I don't know if this strategy will be profitable. But general rule of thumb and experience shows we might make more than we will loose if done correctly What the strategy isnt It is not a holy grail It is not a crystal ball It is not a get rich quick system What Next Try the strategy Post charts Civil discussion Thread Rules No fights, No arguments, No profanity Keep your language civil and respect the next person Read all the links above before commenting Do your home work.

Hi bishopdotun, Regardig the LTF (5 min chart). What is the maximum started trades by the EA (any of Your 14 tested pair)? before it hits TP/Crosses mid/emerqency stop The reason I ask is we need to start thinking about money management and lot size. Keep up with your testing

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Latest Updates Hi traders, a lot has happened since the opening of this thread. - We have now resumed support for LTF . After persistent trials and with the help of @Skyway, @RobotTrader, @R4M and everybody testing, we have been turning out good results. Regardless of the timeframes and pair, RBA system is robust enough to handle it. R4M has been generously improving the EA. - We have launched a Multipair EA . Check the link in the first post to download the latest version. Get ready for a blast. Be sure to learn how the EA trades and how to set it up before you unleash it on your account. By the way, we will not be engaging newbie questions here. Please do the home work and refer to the other thread for all the developments. - I will be sharing tested setups I am using on my life account. I have also setup a demo account and will post results here daily. .....to be continued

R4M-BD-ADR-AllPairsEA ( Link ) Attached Image (click to enlarge) R4M-BD-ADR-AllPairsEA.ex4 is a trading EA that relies on signals generated by R4M-BD-ADR indicator. To use the EA simply attach it to a chart of the pair you wish to trade. D1 is the preferred time frame, but you are welcome to use others, as well. R4M-BD-ADR-AllPairsEA.ex4 trades multiple pairs at the same time -- in contrast to the other trading EA (R4M-BD-ADR-EA.ex4) that trades only the pair associated with the chart it is attached to. There are two ways to specify which pairs to trade -- all pairs listed in your Market Watch window, or manually entering them in the EA's input settings. From a practical point of view, I recommend not to exceed 28 pairs. The computations are fairly CPU-intensive and too many pairs will cause MT4 to freeze. Also, it is probably a good idea to run this in a separate MT4 session that does not include other charts. It is very easy to launch more than one MT4 session so this shouldn't be an issue. There are a few settings to be aware of -- really not too complicated. However, please be aware these settings have a huge effect on the EAs performance. For optimal performance each pair and time frame will require different settings. When using the single-pair trading EA (R4M-BD-ADR-EA.ex4) you could apply calibrated settings that were specifically tailored for a particular pair / time frame. But for this "All Pair" EA we have to compromise and apply one set of parameters that will be used for all pairs. Perhaps in the future we can create a "Calibration Table" the EA can use to look-up the best parameters for each pair / time frame. Below I will briefly describe the most important settings: BD Time Frame: The BD strategy is based on the centered TMA indicator which includes 3 bands -- middle, upper and lower. The BD Time Frame is the time frame used to compute these bands and will always be higher than your chart's time frame. For example, the default setup is to use a BD Time Frame of W1 on a D1 chart. Since a week includes 5 trading days, then that means every W1 "bar" will include 5 D1 bars. But since we are drawing bands, then that means every TMA horizontal step will cover 5 D1 bars. Percent ADR: The upper and lower TMA bands are drawn as offsets from the midline. This offset is computed as a percent of the ADR of the current pair. The default is 100%. So, for example, if a pair's ADR is 48 pips then the upper and lower bands should track with the midline -- 48 pips above and 48 pips below. Number Days to Average ADR: The ADR (Average Daily Range) is an average of the delta (i.e. difference) between each days High and Low over a period of days. The default is 20 days. Exit Conditions: Three types of Exit conditions (signals) are supported: Crossing the midline, crossing the opposite band, closing above / below the midline. The default is "crossing the midline". Apply Momentum Filter: I've adapted the momentum filter from the SpikeHunter indicator to also work with this EA. It is a combination of two momentum indicators -- @Nih98's FX RSI indicator plus Stochastic momentum index (SMI). The default for this parameter is 'false'. Lot Size: Self explanatory. The default is 0.01. StopLoss Fraction ADR: The StopLoss is calculated as a fraction of the current pair's ADR (in pips). TakeProfit Fraction ADR: Similarly, the TakeProfit is calculated as a fraction of the current pair's ADR (in pips).

LTF Settings See shot below for the settings I use on LTF: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Edit: This is the correct settings

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I think we need some kind of money management, for example increasing lotsize like 1-1-1-2-2-2-3-3-3...or step multiplier

--- 帖子 #20 ---
MM For my preference, see trade size estimate below: Lot: 0.01 Account size: 10k at 1:100 leverage No of pairs: 28 I strongly advise against trading this on a lesser account size. Alternatively, you can scale down the number of pairs. Managing your account is your responsibility. Be wise.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
depends on the timeframe, ADR settings and number of pairs. For LTF, where filters are applied, I will approach it this way: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 (6 trade steps) This will apply only where you have a really deep pocket.

Waiting for the bright transaction data released by the brothers. I will come to common sense this ea

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi BD, These are some MM rules contained in the PDF's at the bottom of my post that I have coded into a Correlation EA that control the Dynamic SL and also calculate lot sizes based on the PDL distance from the Mean (the PDL is just a way of tracking the prices between 2 correlated pairs) so in the EA we are working on the PDL will = Current price and the Mean will = whatever Band target we are looking to set as TP. By coding the EA this way any additional lot sizes are only opened at a size required to meet what is referred to as the Realistic gain, which can be adjusted based on a traders R:R requirements What triggers the trades can be an ATR % calculation or just a simple pips distance between trades should another trigger parameter be met. The ATR% or pips distance can be different for each TF &amp; Currency pair and can be saved within a SET file. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Great post RT. This is really detailed. I totally buy the logic. @R4M wants us to first sort out all the entry logics. We have one more week to get that fixed. Once the community is satisfied with entries and exits, then we will move into money management. We just found a very clever solution to entries on LTF. On face value, it looks like an absolute smash. We don't have to catch a falling knife as we currently do. Fractals will actually get us on a safe reversal train. I will deal more on that in subsequent posts. Thank you so much for your efforts in putting together the PDF. I will put it in easy step by step guide for R4M to code. Now over to R4M to keep that as top priority for MM. It is the best suggestion so far.

The EA lacks extensions used by certain brokers to permit trading by EA. Example , LMX does not allow EA trading on symbols without .lmx exttension inserted in the symbols. Similarly other companies do for maintenance of space and load on their server.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Talking of entries and exits. The Daily Ea will deliver the results as long as the market is trending, which does not happen often. Dashboard EA: Can it detect which pair is going to be in momentum for today? Example, EurUsd has trended today. Now it may sleep for today or a week or two and choppy trading will be there triggering stop losses. But does that mean the market maker is not going to make money for today? If they don't make money today, how can they keep the market active? Their algos are designed in such a way that it conducts a ballet dance all the day. Which one will be star pefromer? Nobody knows. But the pattern is known to any trader who focusses on symbols' interplay or correlations. Market maker will select another symbol from EURO family and make it active. May be EurJpy or any other symbol/symbols from the same family. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the MM algo wants to bring EU to a standstill, it will use other symbols to achieve that result. The data like the pictured one below can be captured and some decisions can be made for entering the trades. Presently, I enter the market based on geo-political triggers for 2 months trading and then wait for aftermath to end. It may take 2 months and sometimes 4 months for the momentum to start the game again. How tough it is to make money consistently in the market, only an experienced trader with a minimum 5 years real trading can share with you. For an entry I look for an event that can deliver a shock (abnormal returns) : breakout or breakdown lasting not more than 2 days and take exit. If I feel the breakout is of small size, I will exit with a small TP. Now consolidation or choppy market conditions will deliver to cool the event and force exit of retailers. Retailers are not used to this pattern, get psychologically exhausted. So both entries and exits are equally important. I am not tech-savvy and an Excel newbie, I am able to figure out by instinct (because of experience) which paid is going to be the star performer today. I focus only on one family and try to choose not more than two symbols to trade when Frankfurt market opens provided I believe momentum will be there because of a fundamental reason. If EA can detect this kind of game, then it will pay off. Otherwise, you can always trade in a blind alley called random trading. EA can also engage in diversified trading in multiple symbols to balance the books. It is here the money managment and risk controls will be needed. Database is created in a MT4 file sub-folder based on random entries posted by EA (not by trader) based on currency strength . Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is important to pin down the probable time the momentum and get out after achieving the desired profit target. Maintaining consistency is tough in FX market unless we study how the market makers algos move the market. May be you can choose 5 or six symbols and specialise in trading them.

Fractals on RBA @R4M gave the first description of applying fractals to the strategy. See here. Refer to this post by @Swingman . That is the simplest explanation of Fractals and how it applies to the RBA system. Attached is the fractal indicator we will use going forward except @Swingman performs another magic and gives us something better. The indicator is courtesy of @swingman and @Jagg Why Fractals The shots below provide visual insights. Fractals confirm to us that reversal has happened. May be minor or major. To prevent getting on too many fake reversals, we then choose to use fractal level 3. That saves us from the grieve of high DD and low margins. Note: Fractals will give signals several bars late. Thats the trade-off and we can live with that. We are not in a hurry to catch a falling knife. How To Implement The RBA System is basically tracking extreme prices that pokes above the TMA bands. We hacked the structure of the bands and infused it with ADR% so it responds better to price behaviour of each pair. As price pokes above the bans and closes, dots are printed. Consider this as a falling knife because we don't know exactly when price will reverse but we are sure that somehow price will reverse to the midline and we exit accordingly. Until the return, we take trades once we see a 3Level fractal printed on LTFs. At the moment, it is visually appealing and that gives us some belief about the efficiency it might bring to our trade execution. Refer to #Post22 above. Those are settings for the different TFs (W1, D1 and H4). If you apply the indicator to charts, you will get something like the shots below. Notice I am now looking at LTFs. We are using HTF settings on LTFs. We trade off fractals on LTF. Step 1: Price pokes above / below the band Step 2: Wait for Level 3 Fractal to print (could be several bars late. That's we dropped to a really low time frame) Step 3: Trade the reversal Step 4: Repeat step 3 for each new Level 3 fractal Step 5: Close at the midline H4 on M1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) D1 on M5 Attached Image (click to enlarge) W1 on M15 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Fractal Indicator: Attached File(s) smFractalLevels_v3j.mq4 23 KB | 913 downloads to be continued...

@bishopdotun -- these posts are much too nice -- I fear I'm not worthy... I'll take a look at the latest version of @SwingMan's fractal indicator and incorporate it into a new LTF version of the BD indicator. One thing to note -- the Level-3 fractal squares are not drawn in real-time -- they lag 7 bars (I believe). I plan to modify the fractal indicator to place a mark over the current bar if 7 bars previously there had been a Level-3 fractal. That mark will serve as an Entry signal that can be used for manual trading and later by an EA. Does that make sense?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yes, that make sense. New entry signal based on your BD signal filtered with swingman Level-3 fractal indicator that appeared a few bars back. Since the new signals are few bars late, we may have to set delimiting condition not to accept the combined signal if price has already moved too much away from the original point. Example, for new bottom buy signal 25% from point of origin(low of level-3 fractal) to top of BD band and for new top sell signal 25% from point of origin(high of level-3 fractal) to bottom of BD band.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
@skyway -- I don't think we'll need a delimiting condition because the signal, even though a few bars after the fractal, will still need to satisfy the Entry rule of opening above / below a band. That is, it would have been an Entry signal in the current BD strategy as well. @bishopdotun's decision NOT to use interpolation when drawing the higher time frame bands has the added benefit we can now clearly see there are multiple good Entry signals. If interpolation were enabled then the bands would be curved and it would appear there was only one good Entry (at the top of a curve). So, as long as the original Entry rule is still satisfied, then that nearby fractal serves two purposes -- as a confluence indicator and "thinner" of Entry signals.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Sounds like a great plan. Can I have that done yesterday?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I second that.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Cool.... I initially thought about that. Later, I changed my. We won’t have a problem with distance travelled. In fact, we can still insist on taking only trades below the band. Remember we are now using the lowest TF. Before, we insisted on W1 on D1. Now we can deal W1 on M15 or M30 or H1. These 3 LTF should produce good results. How do I know? M15 * 96 bars = D1 (We need just 7 M15 bars below the band to see 1 fractal signal. We can get max of 13 signals if all the whole D1 bar is below the band &amp; fractal conditions in place) M30 * 48 bars = D1 H1 * 24 bars = D1 Same goes for H4 previously traded on M5 or M15. Now we will get better and safer entries using level 3 fractals of M1. This is all too cool thanks to R4M who switched on the fractal lights. So I suggest we try out in open market. In one session, we will easily spot the best approach. It could also turnout that Skyway’s suggestion is the preferred option. R4M will gladly add it as an input or hard coded filter. We will know when the first session results roll in.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
BD, These Bars you refer to are pure ATR and not a percentage of the ADR? So for example the EA looks back 96 M15 bars and does its calculation correct?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Almost.... but not exactly. That's just standard way of looking at D1 bars. To check for signals, we have to look at last 8 bars on whatever TF we are trading on. It takes 7 bars to for a level 3 fractal. On the open of the 8 bar we should hit the reversal trade.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I wasn't referring to the Fractal calculation just the ATR, rather than using a percentage of the ADR for the smaller TF's. we use the actual bars for each TF, obviously the ATR should = the ADR when applied to the D1, which is how R4M says MT4 coding works anyway for the Daily TF

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Consecutive Candles on RBA While there have been debates on fractals because of potential late entries, there is another alternative for manual traders. In the past week, consecutive candles indicator have come handy. Grab a copy of version 1.04 on forexfactory. Do a simple search. Consecutive candles have no delays and does not repaint. It prints once the candle pattern is completed. Version 1.04 has additional internal filter which I use. CC helps to significantly reduce the amount of potential trades we will be taking. I have done a visual analysis of entries in the shots below (D1 on M15). You immediately notice we now have very few trades compared to what would have happened if we base our decision on only the pink dots. We are interested only in CC signals that print outside the bands. Ignore the rest. Red arrows in the red circle for short trades Green arrows in the green circle for long trades Question marks: Waiting for the next CC signal D1 on M15 (Refer to earlier post for D1 settings) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Once we get this approach fixed, @R4M will be generous enough to give us a modified BD indi that incorporates CC signals outside the bands.

W1 on M30 The shots below are for W1 on M30 (refer to earlier posts for W1 settings) You are looking for: Red arrows above the upper band for short trades Green arrows below the lower band for long trades Exit at midline or opposite band Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Good luck with trading.

For manual trading, R4M-ADR-Multipairs Indicator can act as a market thermometer and detect which pairs gained strength for the day in terms of Daily Range. NZD was at the receiving end. Why? Because there is an important data release for tomorrow. I can't see any other reasons. Will NZD recover what is lost today or go down further? MM algos know what to do. I can guess only after the data is released.

Update on Multipair EA H4 on M15 I installed this on a new demo after the last multipair EA release by @R4M. - So far, so good. Running full auto. - The bot has the potential to cluster trades irresponsibly. - Until @R4M fix the trade clustering issue, this one will remain on demo - It has good potential if the minor changes we have applied is implemented Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Simply impossible to monitor so many pairs simultaneously except with a multipair ea. If you are trading D1 on M15, there has been many good signals today but I bet you could only catch a few. Switching around pairs to catch trades while keeping an eye on my day job. Not so easy. Some pairs are gradually approaching our W1 trading zone. I am happy to wait it out on W1 on H1/15 while I get busy on D1 on M15. Once R4M fix the EA, I will have it set up for W1 on H1, D1 on M15 and H4 on M15 settings on 3 charts. That's huge amount of reversal stuff going on with stops and TP should the market come crashing.

Top on @R4M agenda Refined Entries based on; - (Delivery - July 20) 3 level fractals CC Candles Dynamic lot calculation based on; - (Delivery - July 27) Distance from midline (enumerated by @RT) Till now we are happy with exits. We have all the options covered (Midline, Opposite band and Emergency) Do you want to add anything to the EA agenda above? Show us your suggestion with a live trade (not after the fact) Prove that it works I will then update the agenda regularly @R4M will pick up each request. He is at liberty to adjust the delivery time

Bishopdotun and RB4ME, firstly thank you both for your altruism and incredible work output being shared here, I expect many folks, like me, are following with great interest but not commenting yet and are very appreciative of the efforts you are putting in. I have been studying your ltf chart trade examples above and note that some executed trades originate from locations that neither show a fractal or CC or outside the band location and just wanted to check if that is due to some relocation of the zone or if, in your examples, you are entering trades 'dynamically' outside the suggested 'rules' that RB4ME has outlined, ie you are confident of direction so are taking entries within the zone because you see room to move to first target? One example of this is your AUD/JPY 15 min chart above with a short marked at about 7:45 chart time on post no. 46. Appreciate you must be very busy so if no time to confirm - no worries, just thought it might clear up any confusion for those trying to work out why some of those entries exist. cheers....Paul. :-)

So... I have a day job. Whenever I check my phone and I see the signal, I take it. Unfortunately I am not always there to take the trade like a sniper. It’s over to @R4M to give us the automation. He knows exactly what we want. The trades were not at the CC signal because I was not at my screen when the signal appeared.

Bishop, I have a solution that could help. Check the below Snapshot: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Google for a tool called "Chart Display Manager"- It is a free tool [I have no affiliation with that Site] In an instant you can judge what's happening across 28 pairs or a group of pairs that you follow- If following all 28 pairs- once you see some relevant action on the CDM-you can then switch the Live Account for further Analysis- So no more missed trades for you. Hope it's helps. Thanks

Hey BD, thank you so much for quick reply and for making that clear, you certainly seem to make good things happen with this despite other work limiting your access, nice work. Its very encouraging to see that you can throw in a bit of that flexibility in your entries and still achieve positive outcomes - another mark of the robustness of your underlying methods it would seem - excellent stuff :-). cheers...Paul

@aaven -- this is interesting. Below I've attached an image that includes both yours and my charts. My corresponding chart does show an 'X' Exit condition at the midline. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But I do have a possible explanation. The midline crosses through a rather steep waterfall. If there were a gap then the algorithm would not detect a midline crossing. The algorithm looks for a bar crossing the midline. I'll have to think about this. @aaven -- please keep a note of this test case. And when I come up with a solution then I'd ask you to see if it solves the problem on your chart.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
What's missing. Everything looks ok. Remember we have discussed the shifting bands on several occassions. You may go to the first page to read about shifting bands. This indicator just marks SD zones and try to pick a few entries. The indicator responds to price movement now. Until you really grab the behaviour on LTF vs HTF, I suggest you watch it in real time. Have a look at the huge GBP drop today. The band is based on ADR and will slightly adjust for the huge price movement. Does this clarify things a little? However, if you think something is strange, then show it on bands for today or yesterday. Also note that I prefer consecutive candles only. For fractals, you need to wait a few bars for it to be stable before you take it as a completed signal. To understand how the fractals work, download the stand alone R4M fractals and watch it on strategy tester. Ciao. Edit: Regarding the X for exit at the midline, switch the TF around to see if it comes back. @R4M needs to work on that. I assume it's a bug.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
@bishopdotun -- very nice. It still surprises me the BD strategy works across (almost) all pairs. I don't think I've seen that before. I have created multipair EAs in the past, but I had to employ a "Calibration Table" that held different settings for different pair / time frame combinations.

Unfortunately got caught on GBPNZD as I opened a long trade at green arrow today @1.8586. Bottom ADR band was above the green arrow at the time of the trade and then shifted down due to huge move down. Now the price reached daily ADR and I am waiting for another arrow to go long again. And then if price continues south, I'll exit with a loss based on my MM rule. Regards, Blackeagle

@bishopdotun -- in the LTF version that has already been taken into account. The signal shown is the Entry signal. That is also the signal the upcoming EAs will use. Regarding the missing 'x' -- I posted above that it is not missing on my chart. There appears to be a gap at the midline on @aaven's chart. I'm wondering if others have seen a missing 'x' and, if so, if they can tell whether or not there is a gap there.

From what I have seen so far, the fractal is giving me too many signals. Not sure it's working correctly. @R4M needs to check and if he says it is working correctly then I will stick with CC alone. I need more precision and CC does that for me. On my recent chart examples, you can see red and blue boxes. They are level 3 fractals. I have explained them in previous posts. You see how they reinforce the SD areas. I will add to trades as they appear in the direction of the reversal trades.

Avoiding Waterfall.. See this waterfall on EurUsd. Previously, we would have been in grieve of some DD. Now we have clearly avoided that.

On this, I would say the code is somehow correct. Look a few bars left, there are some candles above the upper boundary. So in case there are some trades open, then the EA will exit. I think this one is fine. I actually like that it's printing the mark when price cross that line. I let @R4M have a look.

On trading on M5 I strongly suggest you don't do this in a live environment. It is as good as catching a falling knife edge. However, if you love the challenge, I suggest to trade off level 3 fractals that print on or outside the upper or lower bands. The shots below offer visual clues on how you would trade. D1 on M5 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Disclaimer: Level 3 fractals could print up to 8 - 25 bars late based on my observation on strategy tester. This should not be a problem for you though because you don't want to jump on a reversal too early. You have to watch this one like a hawk. Even if you are 25 bars late, there will be plenty opportunities and pips to catch. Don't be greedy. 24 M5 bars = 2 H1 bars which is less than 1 H4 bar. Wait patiently for a trading opportunity to develop. If price gets away before you catch it, then look for another opportunity. Patience is golden in FX trading. I prefer to wish I was in a trade than to wish I was not. You will thank me later.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Trading m5 and lower is strongly not recommended unless the trader already has prior scalping skills and experience. Level-3 fractal and/or CC offer little to no protection against waterfall.

Final Verdict on M5 For explanation purposes, I have shared examples of how you would trade with D1 on M5. This requires waiting and baby sitting. For my work schedule, this cant work. and for now, R4M would not be working on automating level 3 fractals for trading. That is a long shot. I imagine that would be in the next 5 or 6 versions. There are more pressing things. In the mean time, I would go with W1 on M15. That gives me a lot of freedom and pip range to harvest. To all the M5 lovers, I wish you good luck. You can share your results here. At least, you know how to deal now. If you don't, look at the examples today. ...trade responsibly Ciao.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
@skyway -- they are Level-2. The Level-3 indicator I tried using repaints and markings could be 20-30 bars behind -- it was too variable. In my hands Level-2 fractals gave approximately same number of markings as CC -- sometimes they overlapped exactly. More often than not, the Level-2 fractals were a bit ahead of CC. To be honest, if I could trade Level-3 fractals I wouldn't need the BD indicator. Level-3 is like using the ZigZag indicator. If we are going to allow 20-30 bars for a marking to develop then we wouldn't need any other indicator. Right now we are like explorers -- in uncharted waters. It remains to be seen what things work and what don't. It may also be a matter of preference.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
To follow up... Below is a screen shot that shows Level-3 (and Level-2) fractals, along with the ZigZag indicator. You can see that ZigZag corresponds well with Level-3 fractals. We all know that ZigZag is not tradeable in real-time. If you are willing to look back, then maybe. But I really don't want to get into algorithms that require looking back. This isn't the holy grail. With the ability to trade 28 pairs we go for the shotgun approach -- perhaps 0.70 WinRatio or better. That truly is an edge. We tolerate losing from time-to-time. There's an old song -- ""Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall"... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #111 ---
@aaven -- this may have been caused by repainting. An Entry signal that existed in real-time, but then goes away when more data arrives. And then it looks like a "zombie" Exit. I'm not sure, though.

M5 trading using the All Pairs EA - I used 1440 timeframe, percentage ADR 40 and # Day ADR at 26. Up to today I've only manually traded the bands but decided to use the All Pairs EA as I had some free time to monitor it. I like to be in and out of the market in as short a time as possible which is why I chose the M5 timeframe. I like to trade where possible with a 50/50 SL/TP, From manually trading I've been getting a good success rate, so I decided to set the ADR at 0.50 for both SL and TP which is close to the mid level band and had the Exit set to crosses mid level. 14 successful trades and 3 losing trades, I still have 7 other open trades and currently 5 plus and 2 negative. - Could someone just confirm the number of open trades is the amount of maximum open trades on that pair? - Does anyone have a good screenshot indicator to take the open and closing of each trade for every pair tested on the all pairs ea? would like to be able to show the difference in band movements of trades. Thanks B

@Brinet16 -- very nice. And it's great to hear. Yes -- I can confirm. That setting applies per pair.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi, I have a suggestion to the EA on the LTF. This is MM but I think it should be in the EA already so we can test. I don’t remember who came with the idea of pips distance between the trades? Anyway my suggestion is that we can set in an option in the EA called: Pips distance Let’s say that we have set it on 20, we get a buy signal from the BD LTF with fractals/CC. First buy trade is started (like we have today). But the price is still in the same area maybe it goes down 15-20 pips but then it goes up again to same price where we already have trade 1 and we get another signal from fractals/CC (we are still outside the bands) now my idea is that since we are inside of the pips distance of 20 pips the EA will NOT open a new trade. We have then 2 scenarios 1. The price continue up and hit target or crossing midline (trade closed) 2. The price goes against us let’s say 40 pips and now it starts moving upwards again and we got a new buy signal from fractals/CC (we are still outside the bands) this time the price is now 35 pips from first trade, so the EA check with pips distance is it over or under 20 pips? Yes, we start a new buy trade. So what I want is that the new trade we are adding only will start after X distance of pips. Understand what I mean?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Steve, You are missing the point that i am trying to make. Forget about the passage of time-of course if 30 minutes happens-MT4 will publish 6 M5 candles. From coding point of view: Once the indicator published a fractal[ Purple Box Icon], Example: We are looking at 5 Minute Charts Current Time is say 14:01 A Fractal "X1" appears on the just concluded bar [13:55-14:00] Bar. On subsequent formation of new 5 Minutes candles-[14:00-14:05] -[14:05-14:10]........[14:45-14:50] etc... At any point within [14:01-14:50] if we quickly switch the time frames on the chart we are looking at to say 30 minutes and back to 5 minutes very quickly. is there a possibility that the Fractal "X1" can disappear? I mean to ask, are the Fractals that are published-are they permanent or can they change? Thanks

--- 帖子 #125 ---
R4M and bishopdotun Thanks to you, every day has become fun these days. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
@aaven -- I still don't understand. You posted two M5 charts. One has 6 more bars than the other. Their data is different. Over the course of 30 minutes bands may shift (as has been discussed previously) or bands may repaint. This could cause markings to come and go. These changes result in anomalies in how charts are drawn. We don't trade based on historical pictures -- we trade in real-time. And we've been accumulating a lot of evidence that real-time trading works well. Yes -- it would be nice if all the markings held their position. But that's part of the trade off. Small changes in historical data will cause historical markings to come and go, but these changes do not seem to affect real-time trading.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Following-up from my previous post... I think what may seem obvious to me may not be obvious to others, so I'll attempt to describe it from another point of view... Indicators use simple algebraic equations. There is no intelligence. There is no database. There is no artificial intelligence. In algebra you make simple comparisons, like: if (band &gt;= 1.200) then draw blue dot But what if band is 1.199? Well, then it doesn't draw a blue dot. But we all know that 1.199 is really close enough to 1.200 that we should treat them the same, right? So, what is happening is that in real-time the band was 1.200 and a blue dot is drawn and we have an Entry signal and open a trade. A few bars later the band shifted to 1.199 -- hence the blue dot is not drawn. These small shifts due to recalculations and repainting will affect how historical markings are drawn but, even so, the algebra is usually still good enough to make real-time trading decisions.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
It could be given a range e.g. Min 1.195 Max 1.205, the number does not need to be exactly 1.200 Then if all other trigger conditions are met a trade is opened. At the moment opening a trade at the start of a new Bar if conditions are met is building up too much risk in one spot and also if PA as moved closer to the Target since the first (or any subsequent trades) then no new trade(s) should be opened. We only want to add more trades at a more extreme level (providing conditions are met) than any previous trade(s), also the very last trade to open TP (within a grid or basket of trades) should be the new Target for all open trade whether this makes them close in profit of not.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
@Robot Trader -- thank you!! I was hoping someone would play into my hand... Okay -- let's say we have a range [1.195,1.205]. Or, let's say +/- 5%. That doesn't change anything. It's the same issue. So, now 1.195 produces a blue dot and 1.194 doesn't? Why +/- 5%? Why not +/- 5.1%? Once you start down the path of applying numeric thresholds there is no end. If you suggest [1.195,1.205] then @skyway will suggest [1.190,1.210], and it goes on and on. Plus, the optimal range may differ from pair-to-pair and TF-to-TF. Plus it may change under different market conditions. Who's prepared to continually update all those settings? This is why I like ADR. We know what it is in advance . It automatically adapts for each pair and market conditions. And it is not dependent on TF. A discretionary trader will always out-perform an algorithm. A discretionary trader isn't using algebra in his/her brain -- so he/she can see that 1.194 is close enough to 1.195 to go ahead and make the trade. I remember that AI (artificial intelligence) was really big about 35 years ago when I studied computer science. But when it didn't meet expectations it sort of fell by the wayside. But more recently it has made a return in a big way -- e.g. driver-less cars, medical diagnoses -- where there is lots of money to be made. AI doesn't necessarily use algebra to make decisions. It's ability to make decisions also draws on a huge database of prior decisions. So, a solution using AI could likely compete with a discretionary trader and decide that 1.194 is good enough. Let's not knock algebra, though -- it works fairly well. It's not going to be 100%, but at least we can automate trading to a degree that is profitable and doesn't require 10000 - 20000 hours of screen time. OMG -- are you kidding me? Sitting in front of a screen for hours on end waiting for a setup? EDIT: Even though AI has been around for a long time, I think the main reason it has made a strong come-back is because of faster hardware. AI requires huge databases to make accurate decisions. And 35 years ago computer storage and CPUs weren't fast enough. Now days my Android phone has more computing power than a 40-year old super computer.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
The +/- 5% can also be dynamic, it does not need to be cast in stone. The Min/Max tolerance, (in my example = 5%) it would have been worked out from the ever changing most recent PA movement calculated from the ATR of the TF that we are trading, so the tolerance itself can be dynamic and therefore could this be the start of AI We know PA is made up of small and large bars and the ATR does a good job of monitoring them in the form of an average, so we only need a small sample of say 5 past bars (which will forever be dynamic even though we are using 5 bars and yes before you say it, it could be 3 bars and this again could be dynamically calculated based on the forever changing ADR for each currency pair that we trade) so this information wants coding into the EA to make better trading decisions. I have shared a PDF of how in part it can be done when applied to a correlation EA that looks at Currency Pairs A &amp; B, with this reversal strategy there in only Currency Pair A to apply the logic to.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
@Robot Trader -- okay, dynamic is better. But why go to that trouble? Why add complexity? To address a shift / repainting issue that has little to no effect on real-time trading? All that just so historical markings don't change? Look it -- I get exactly where you are coming from. The way you think about it is similar to the way I look at solving problems. So, resisting your suggestion does not come naturally for me. @bishopdotun has emphasized to me that he really, really, really favors the KISS approach. And I like that a lot. So, unless there is a highly compelling reason to take a more complex approach then I'm not inclined. Suggesting something "might" or "could" work better does not qualify as compelling. Also, you would need to quantify what "better" would be -- i.e. 5% higher win rate? 20% higher? 1.3% higher? And, @Robot Trader, thanks for pursuing this with me. Please understand I'm sort of "using" you to also address others who are thinking along the same lines. You've opened the door to allow me to express how I feel about a larger issue. EDIT: @Robot Trader -- I hope you were kidding. That would be akin to us designing a paper airplane and then thinking our next project would be a rocket ship to the moon. AI -- totally different beast. Requires a database and all the methods to store and retrieve records. Plus, you would have to populate the database to begin with. There's a reason why there was nearly a 30 year gap between the introduction of AI and current applications. It's not that geniuses at MIT weren't trying, it's just there are lots of hurdles in applying it to real-world problems. Only recently an AI program was able to beat a human in chess -- and they've been trying to do that for decades.

Nope, skyway will not suggest anymore new calibration other than those he posted earlier. Skyway do not believe in the recalibration exercise of any sort with the intent to "optimise" performance. Learnt that years ago - that's simply curve-fitting. Fixed universal calibration on all pairs/instruments/assets and on all timeframe is what skyway use today without any recalibration at all.

"@Robot Trader -- okay, dynamic is better." "Also, you would need to quantify what "better" would be -- i.e. 5% higher win rate? 20% higher? 1.3% higher?" Dynamic is the total opposite of static, so it is always changing and thus can never be curve fitted because every new bar that opens to form the average calculation of the ATR will never be exactly the same, so it is looking to be a kin to the here and now. What makes this "better" than static is we are looking to base trading decisions on the present structure of Price, not just a 20 pip target fits all. Using percentages of the ADR for TP/SL is fine when trading the D1, in fact we are really using the ATR for the D1 for the calculations of that TF. So when we trade the M15, we need to know what each one of those bars are doing when setting the TP/SL for that TF, having 40% of the past 14 D1 Bars for a TP target (example) is meaningless to the current price structure on the M15 chart we are looking to trade. BTW. My reference to tolerance Min/Max was just my way of showing an EA does not need to use just a fixed number within a parameter to make a trading decision, but that does not mean I was wanting to apply it in the context of what was being discussed, rather I was just saying 1.2 does not need to be a reason why the EA would skip a trade or not draw a dot. KISS if fine and the original strategy was based on the D1 very much KISS when taking into account the ADR and logic being applied to it on that TF, but we are now looking to apply it to the LTF's, so for me KISS would be to use the Bars that are from those TF's and not try and complicate it by applying ADR percentages to much smaller forming Bars, which like I have already said are meaningless to the current structure of price on these smaller TF's

@Robot Trader -- okay, suppose it gets implemented. And let's suppose my profit is currently $1000 / week. What will my profit be with the dynamic adjustment that takes into account minor shifts and repainting? Will it be $5000 or $10000 / week. Will it be $1005 / week? Sure -- there are lots of good ideas. We have something now that works well and, so, I don't understand the search for more. Well, actually I do. I think we've been searching for something better for so long that it has become so ingrained we can't stop. I'm okay with making it better. But it has to be more than hand-waving. It takes many hours for me to implement each idea. And if it doesn't work then people say, oh well -- nice try. But it's my time. I don't want to spend hours implementing hunches. You've developed indicators and EAs -- why not implement a "proof-of-concept" EA that demonstrates how dynamic price adjustments that take into account minor band shifts and repainting yields higher profits. @Robot Trader -- I understand where you are coming from. But I'm not sure you understand where I'm coming from. EDIT: Keep in mind the dynamic adjustments you suggest are intended to address minor shifts in the bands due to recalculation of the current bar. We've demonstrated these minor shifts have almost negligible impact on real-time trading. This issue only arose because historical markings on charts sometime appear and disappear. Who cares what the historical markings look like. For all intents and purposes we could attach a piece of cardboard to our monitors that hides the entire chart except for the current bar. All we care about is the current bar.

@skyway -- I'm on a roll. Whereas @George was a "target level" junkie, I've become an ADR junkie. To answer your question -- No. Furthermore, it doesn't make sense. How's that for an answer? ADR is a metric you can take to the bank. It's real. You can hold it in your hand. You can even predict what it will be tomorrow or next week. ADR means that by the end of the day the delta (i.e. difference) between the High and Low will be the same as it was the previous day. The reason why it doesn't make sense for other time frames is because you don't know when the High and Low will occur during the day -- i.e. during that session. All you know is the delta between the High and Low will be the same from session to session. The only way it makes sense to even talk about an equivalent for H4 or H1 is if we knew the delta between High and Low each H1 or H4 were the same. But we know that's not the case. There is only one ADR and it applies to Daily (i.e. a session). BTW -- you can go higher time frames -- i.e. W1 or MN1 -- but that's because those are multiples of D1.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
@Robot Trader -- so, you're extending a little bit outside my knowledge and comfort zones. You may have a point. Perhaps @bishopdotun could weigh in. Obviously he has a much better grasp on this than me and can analyze both the forest and the trees.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
We all look to bring something to the table (add value) and yes I have and am still developing EA's, but I am not a coder, so I pay for the code to be written and I have used the same coder for over 10 years. The relationship is such that I give him a specification and we then go through a number of email exchanges until both parties are happy they understand each other. This way once the EA is coded and it is not following the rules (a bug) then the issue is sorted by my coder, before moving onto any revisions (it is a process) I do not have an EA that uses bands, apart from the correlation EA, BUT that is much more complicated, due to the axis of pairs A &amp; B being totally different the indicator cannot be loaded onto the Main Chart, we have to have a sub chart indicator that the EA uses, so the EA within its calculations as to take into account the ATR of Currency Pair A &amp; B, otherwise one pair would out weight the other when returning to the Mean, due to the pip range of each pair being different. So really in comparison your reversal EA is much simpler we can load the indicator onto the Main Chart and we only have to deal with one pair at a time. I do have an EA that uses MA's for its trading logic and the ATR for each TF is built into the parameters and I know this works and I might be able to produce a video of it trading, to show how the ATR dynamically controls the TSL and TP, based on the most recent price movement, but I paid to have the EA coded this way and not because I like spending my money but because I spent a long time working out what works best. I have a question for you, with these 2 new indicators (Fractal &amp; CC) are they looking at candles from the D1 or the TF they are loaded on, if the latter then why is this important why are they not using a percentage of the D1 candles? My Dad (who would be 102 now if he was still alive) had a favorite saying, "You can lead an horse to water, but you can't make it drink"

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Its easy to answer its called the ATR, it always calculates based on the TF you place it on

--- 帖子 #141 ---
@skyway -- okay, I'll tell you why. I don't know... Seriously -- what other metric in the forex world can you predict in advance? Can you predict the "H1delta" or "H4delta" in advance? No. But you can predict the "D1delta" (i.e. ADR) in advance. As to why there is an ADR -- well, you can answer that better than me. During the day there are forces that pull the price one way or another, but at the end of the day the system tends toward a fair value or equilibrium. This is why "Envelopes" work -- the distance between the upper and lower bands remains relatively constant. The river may bend up or down, but the river maintains its width. I guess the reason why ADR works is because there is this concept of a "session". Financial transactions occur at the beginning, middle and end of each session. Our OTC trading is just a small blip in the overall foreign exchange market. At the end of each day large banks and financial institutions close shop and people go home for the evening -- they have tasks to complete during each session and don't leave things hanging. Of course that's an over-simplification, but I suspect there is some truth to it.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
First I have to address this. If my dad were alive he would be 92 -- and I miss him. And there were many things we disagreed on -- especially how stubborn he was. And as I get older it sometimes scares me -- I'm turning into my dad... @Robot Trader -- good question. And this ties in with @skyway's recent comments. But let's be clear about one thing -- even though I write statements that may come across as authoritative, I don't know anything for sure. I throw things out there to be provocative to see what sticks. If it doesn't get thrown back at me then I figure I was right. As I wrote to @skyway, taking a percentage of the ADR doesn't make sense. It has no meaning. The ADR is the one forex metric you can predict in advance. It is the delta between the High and Low over the course of a session. There is no equivalent for other time frames. Sure, you can talk about 40% ADR but it means nothing -- it's just a number -- because you don't know when that 40% will occur. It could occur at any point during a session. The only thing we know for sure is that the delta between the High and Low for the current session will be the same as yesterday's delta. That's what makes the ADR special. I don't think the ADR is granular.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I am enjoying the conversation guys. I will distill the key points below: - ADR vs ATR (Should we draw bands on LTF) - Dynamic calculation of exits (TP, SL, Emergency) based on moving bands - Dynamic Lot calculation based on distance to TP I will try to summarize my input in later posts. For now, I am enjoying the GBP show and the splendid catch of my BD nets across board. If you are trading this live, your account should be bubbling now.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
No. There's no assumption. You've used my ADR indicator. No one had to develop some algorithm. It's there staring you in the face. The delta between the High and Low over the course of each session is the same. There's no such thing as shorter cycles. The market operates within a session. The ADR is the same from session to session. There is no such thing as "half-sessions", or "quarter-sessions". Hence there is no such thing as 50% ADR or 25% ADR. I hope females won't be offended -- it's like being pregnant. Either you are or you aren't. You're not 50% or 25% pregnant. ADR, like pregnancy, is not granular.

F ood for thought..... After trying many strategies in FX, I have come to realise that simplicity and patience wins the race. I prefer simplicity over complexity. Since I started using simple and clear methods, my account balance has been growing consistently month on month. Simple experiment...... I have done it plenty times and it works. I want to see if others can replicate similar results. No maths jargon, no sophisticated technique. We just want to use Level 3 fractal and distance from midline to harvest pips. Remember this is just experiment. Try it for 2-3 months. Pick any FX pair of your choice. - Set up W1 on M15 or M30 - Buy when you see red box (Level 3 fractals) below the blue line - Sell when you see blue box above the blue line - One trade per box - Close your trade each time price touches the blue line (whether in profit or not) and wait for another setup - SL is 2*ADR Conditions - Price must be at least 40% ADR from the midline at the time of taking each trade. Otherwise, pass - If price has moved far (spiked) from the box when it prints, pass Note: The boxes have almost 20 bar delay. Don't worry about that. Just place the trade whenever it shows. provided the rules are in place A picture is worth more than a thousand words. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello with everyone First thanks to those who are involved in this project for their fantastic work. Doing several tests I discovered that according to the configuration you can manage a small account like $ 100. I want to know if I am correct in putting a tight stop loss. The one of the tests is stop loss 0.01 adr. My question is how I can see in the graph the lines that would correspond to Stop Loss and TP. Greetings from Ecuador

--- 帖子 #174 ---
@MSuccess -- interesting -- I've never seen that before. user32.dll is a Windows DLL. Under Tools / Options / Experts do you have 'Allow DLL imports' checked?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I hadn't but now i have, thanks, but i am not sure it will address the issue. According to https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/994 "DLL calls are completely forbidden in the virtual terminal. During the first attempt to call a function from DLL, the launched program is stopped with the critical error.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
@MSuccess -- User32.dll is a Windows DLL and every program -- even MT4 -- uses User32.dll. If MetaQuotes virtual hosting truly prevents an indicator or EA from using a Windows DLL then you should switch to a different VPS. There is nothing special about MetaQuotes VPS -- other than it is slower and more expensive and prevents you from using the VPS for applications other than MT4. In order to get around this issue I would have to cripple the EA and indicator -- which, of course, isn't an option. I would suggest that for now you not use a VPS -- simply run MT4 from your local machine.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
@Vicente -- this is nice, thanks. But why not provide enough information so someone else could attempt to reproduce it. Why not upload a screen shot of the Report?

My EA setups Ok guys......@R4M did it again. Thank you so much for the efforts. The new versions of the indicator and EAs are out. I understand they are off the press. Test them very well and be sure they trade correctly before applying on your account. Click this link to download the latest version. I have now unleashed the 3 on the previous demo account. See my setups below. All on the same account. The idea is to catch the reversals depending on which granularity it is starting from. With the consecutive candles, I should normally have very few trades. My first feeling is that, I am getting way too many trades on some pairs. I have applied the indicator to the chart and there simply is no explanation for those numbers. @R4M please check. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) W1 on M15 - ChfJpy: Clearly the trades weren't from this setup. Trade condition has not been fulfilled. Attached Image (click to enlarge) D1 on M15: If the trades are from the D1 on M15 setup they are wrong trades. I have only one CC signal outside the band. Attached Image (click to enlarge) H4 on M15: This is also unlikely. I attached the CC indicator to the chart for reference. There is only one CC signal in that clustered range. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Even if the trades resulted from fractals due to error in the code, I would say these are too many trades. @R4M, kindly consider the fractal settings I shared with you. That will significantly reduce the number of entries when fractal settings is selected. One very good entry with a higher risk is better than 10 reckless entries with microlot.

@ARSpips, @benjun9, @bishopdotun -- thanks for the reports. I am also running the AllPairs EA on W1/M30 and also no trades so far. I've run the single trading EA (R4M-BD-ADR-EA) in Strategy Tester and, so, have some confidence it is working. But I can't test the AllPair EA in the same way. The main difference between the current version and the previous is the way it keeps track of the current bar to avoid intra bar trading. @jdva had reported a bug that the AllPairs was missing trades -- and I think the reason was because I was using one timestamp variable to keep track of each pair's last bar. The proper thing to do is to treat each pair separately. And, so, I "fixed" the bug. In addition to testing the AllPairs EA could you also run the single trading EA (R4M-BD-ADR-EA) on 8 pairs to make sure it is taking trades as expected? I will do the same. If the single trading EA works then I'm pretty sure the problem is with my "fix" since otherwise the two EAs share the same code.

This is my Multi-time trading screen, W1 / D1; D1 / H1; 240 / M15. I realized that when trading at TF H1 when in preparation for trading under the BD strategy, if TF M15 qualifies, trading at TF H1 will definitely benefit and reduce capital loss. This is my manual waiting rule.

1) I'm using D1 on 5min template from 2nd page for trade entries. 2) I use W1 on 15min to look at the overall market structure. To see where I am at in the bigger picture because of the fractal nature of the market.

Results.... This is the auto-trading result from the multipair EA. The shot below has all the information you need to know. Dont take the result too seriously. It could have been better or worse if the EA was working correctly. I also doubt if you would be able to replicate my result. Before you get excited about the results, let us wait for @R4M to release the new updates and test if it will continue to perform well. I have the multipair EA setup on 3 charts with W1, D1 and H4 settings shared earlier. I just wanted to catch all possible signals. I assume the trades should balance themselves out and there shouldn't be dull moments even during short ranges. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good Day robots4me, I was testing this in a demo account starting on July 17 for one week and the results are awesome. I used the standard configuration in a 15 Minutes chart. I started with the single ea for gbpjpy and eursusd, and it went well and the next day I enabled the all pairs ea including gold, silver and the two crudes. The maximum drawdown was between 1500 and 1800 and there were 14 pairs opened. The trades last between two and three days, many went to sl but most of them went to TP. It looks very promising, it is like almost 150 per pair in an aggressive mode. I read something that the latest version is not working properly so I will use the first version I started which is in the zip package 19196. Thanks for the hard work on this ea. I know this will be the best. Any advice is welcomed.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
@niltino -- this is excellent. It will certainly bring a smile to @bishopdotun's face.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Lol my evidence ? But where is yours that your repainter works ? This thing only look good in hindsight, waste of time. If you Don’t think so? So ask your friend the bishop to put up a demo t.e here in his/her own thread and everybody will see the evidence. you can do it too, if you feel confident

Thank you metta87. I see you are too proud to read the basics of the strategy on the first page and too occupied criticizing other people’s business. I didn’t put a gun to your head to come here.

@bishopdotun and followers of this thread -- this fellow's post is a good sign. When people like @metta87 start crawling out of the woodwork to attract attention then it is further proof the strategy is gaining broader attention. Based on the "shouts" he's received, this isn't @metta87's first rodeo.

Closed trades. I’ll get in some new ones today. If you’re feeling overwhelmed with a lot of entry signals coming in and you need a filter to select best of the best. Check the chart image below. Use in confluence with R4M-BD-ADR lines. I’m talking about those who are interested in manual trading (Daily on 15min tpl), that is. Hope I’m not overstepping here and should step back.

@SolidSnake -- what's the point of all the charts? I can also post a few dozen. My thumb gets tired scrolling and my eyes and brain have to work harder to ignore your posts looking for the good stuff. Would you mind not posting so many charts?

@lemercenaire -- sorry, it's not knowledge. It's noise. We don't need the analysis. This is more like a @George wannabe. We are interested in trading -- Entries and Exits -- and testing. I don't need jargon like "pushes", accumulations, stop hunts, etc. This is just @George BS -- it has nothing to do with trading.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that a lot of your trades in this post and before is not really following the rules? The ones you posted before got a lot of entries before the signal came. And in this one, for example AUDCAD - Is that a sell below midline? Or a buy before waiting for the signal? I can see it confuse and misled many other newbies as me.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
@SolidSnake we would like to stick with the RBA system. Let's keep things neat and tidy. All the extras get people confused. 1 or 2 shots would get the message across. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
No, not really, my entries are actually RBA system, I enter when price move outside yellow ADR lines and have a signal for sell. The thing is, after few hours, if price keeps going against me, then the ADR recalculate and shift. So you might think my first entry wasn't by the book in hindsight but it was in real-time. No more distraction. Sticking to RBA system. Thanks. Oh sorry. Alright Steve.

Some closed trades..... The strike rate is unreal. Wait till we have a bug free version before making a judgement. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next updates will be released by @R4M as soon as he is sure the identified bugs are fixed.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
The logic is as simple as it looks.... Above the bands, you can try different entry variations.... Bar close or CC candles or fractals or all (if you have the balls) You can draw the bands with either %ADR (R4M &amp; BD) or ATR(RT &amp; Skyway)..... You can try H4, D1, or W1... Just follow the money once the reversal kicks in. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
My Tick data back test using BD (I think I got them correct) settings on the M30 is finally complete, please see screenshot of Graph/Results/Settings and an excel spreadsheet. There is a Flat Line in the graph where trades opened and closed simultaneously which I have reported to R4M on the other thread. For me the next step is to analyze the trades in visual mode and see what the EA was doing, I may have to do this using OHLC for the indicator to work in Strategy Tester. When scrolling back on the M30 live chart the Upper and Lower bands shift over time, so what you see historically is not what the EA is seeing at the time of the trade. BD I have been thinking there is a way to stop the bands moving and that is to use the data from the last period for the current bands. Example, we input the setting 240 (H4) so the EA uses the H4 data for the previous (completed H4) for the current H4 the one that just started this way the bands do not shift. So during the current H4 period the EA records its values ready to apply them to the next H4 period once the current one is finished. This means the bands will be based on an historic H4 average that only happened 4 hours ago, but because it is historic the bands can't shift (or repaint like some like to call it)

--- 帖子 #261 ---
@Robot Trader -- I was going to let @bishopdotun respond first, but when I saw that statement coffee spurted out my nose. First of all, shifting is natural . Shifting is the same as "recalculation". It occurs because intra-bar ticks have different prices. There will always be recalculation with the current bar since it is caused by ticks. Secondly, we trade in the present, not in the past. I would always favor current data over stale data. Thirdly -- the shifting seems more pronounced because we overlay a HTF bar on a LTF chart. This is equivalent to zooming in by an order of magnitude or more. So this makes shifting appear more pronounced. Fourthly -- the goal is good trading performance. The goal is not to avoid shifting. Given a choice between a strategy that performs well and shifts versus one that performs poorly and doesn't shift, I would choose the former. Some people are more interested in shifting. Furthermore, there is zero evidence that even if there were no shifting it would impact performance. It's based on a hunch. Hunches have their time and place -- but we have a tiger by the tail and pursuing hunches isn't on the current road map.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
@Robot Trader -- since I gave you a hard time on the previous post let me soften it by thanking you for sharing this tick-data back test. I think the results are excellent. A nearly 75% win rate with a profit factor of 2.70 -- this is amazing. I think I have an explanation for the flat-lining region -- which I will address in the other thread shortly. If my "hunch" is correct, the the win rate for your back test could be even higher -- perhaps exceeding 80%. Again -- thank you.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Robot Trader, run a live cent account test 0.01lot on 28 pairs for at least a week. That's the only way to give indication of the true performance of this shifting BD ADR strategy.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
@skyway -- yes -- but after I fix the "AllPairs" EA which currently doesn't trade. The next release is coming shortly and I hope that issue is fixed. Live testing -- either Demo or Real -- is the only way to go.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi R4M, From the settings in my M30 DB BT can you please run it for the same time period on GBPUSD with your OHLC method (I know it will only take ten minutes), when I try to do it on my MT4 platform it loses money and I thought with less quality data it would perform better, I find this strange. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #266 ---
@Robot Trader -- yes, I will do that this evening (for me). I will also run the optimizer (which you could never do with tick data because it would take several years for one test to complete). It could be that with your current settings the results are crappy, but with other settings the results are good.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi R4M, Now there is a mental picture of someone wasting coffee So please a word of warning read what I have to say with caution and no coffee involved. My thoughts are that the bands will not shift if produced like I have described and we are looking for a extreme so once the bands are broken and then get recalculated based on the current method is it the bands that are really giving us the edge or the CC candles, because we past the first point of extreme that the EA found based on our rules when the first band giving the trigger shifted and vanished into thin air leaving no real idea why we are even in the trade. Also when we take my example of the H4 when the next H4 opens using the data from the past H4 for the first hour that data is still almost as relevant as using the current method when we enter the 4th hour of that H4 period apart from the fact the bands will not shift based on my method. I would also say that does an extreme really build up just in the current H4 period or does it take time and therefore build over more than one H4 period therefore not making the prior period irrelevant in spotting an extreme. Did you code this band indicator from scratch or did you use existing code if the latter would you please share a link for the code, I will visit this myself once my current project is finished. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Working hard, brothers

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Excellent result right there. That result is every traders dream. Low DD, High win rate, &gt;2 profit factor e.t.c. My first reaction to your request; if it’s not broken don’t fix it. On second thought, I feel may be we might find something special while doing that. That depends on @R4M’s generosity. He has committed so much time to development already and I want him to enjoy trading like I am currently doing. Up to him to decide if it’s worth pursuing. I will run this live for another 2 weeks on 28 pairs. After which I will consider if I need to further tweak this. So far on demo, my result closely trail yours even though there are bugs to be fixed.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
No. The edge is never the CC. If you apply the CC to your chart alone, it’s a loss maker. However, from its make up, it sort measures candle reversal pattern. You can read up the thread. That’s why I prefer to use it once I am in the reversal zone. I get your point about using fixed bands. Only that I don’t know if that would give you any edge. Why would I use yesterday’s data on today’s price. The fact is once price pokes above or below today’s ADR band, then I expect a reversal. That logic is broken if I use yesterday’s data.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Let me put it into the context that R4M mentioned about ADR being the only indicator to predict the future, so in essence that is what I am wanting the bands to do, does that sound logical, because they either can predict the future or they can't.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
@Robot Trader -- clarification. You took me too literally. What I mean is that I can predict the EURUSD's ADR for tomorrow. I can predict what it will be next week. I don't know of any other forex metric that is that predictable. However, as I keep mentioning, it lacks the 4th-dimension -- time. So, you can't trade the ADR alone. In the context of a reversal trading strategy, you open a reverse trade when the cup is 100% full, right? I'm speaking very roughly. But without the 4th-dimension you don't know when that will occur. Only that it will occur sometime during the day. @rosalieone's observation was that the cup reaches 100% full around the same time every day. Not literally, but there definitely is a pattern. Check out my recent post in the other thread ( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...5#post12401925 ). And there is an obvious explanation -- when the NY session ends then trading activity goes way down. So -- it makes sense. Where else in forex does anything else make sense?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
No shifting standard mt4 Cloud or Kumo predicts the future. Don't ask me how to use it, you have to ask the Japanese.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
@skyway -- it doesn't predict -- just because it says it predicts doesn't make it so. The Ichimoku Kinku shifts past history forward -- sort of like what @Robot Trader was suggesting. In other words, it takes past data and plots a few bars into the future. It trend follows...

--- 帖子 #275 ---
The japanese traders use the 5 elements to " trade at a glance ", that's the meaning of it's name. The west have yet to comprehend the mystique of this oriental creation in 1930s. Goichi Hosoda used some zen elements that only devoted practitioners can uncover it's true secrets.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
BTW. MT5 when using optimization can use each core of your CPU, for each parameter you want to optimize, so if you have for example a 8 core CPU and look at 8 optimization settings then that one BT will be the same as doing the BT I just did in MT4, but you get 8 tests in the same time, how good is that

--- 帖子 #277 ---
@skyway -- I've seen the source code. I've used it in other strategies. It takes past data and pushes it forward a few bars. It's fancy trend following. It doesn't predict. It is not mystical or magical. Pure trend following based on moving averages...

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Your post here refers. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...5#post12401925 This is how the LTF A"whatever"R works in real time.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
@skyway -- I don't understand. I was referring to your post about the Ichimoku Kumo or Cloud indicator.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Post#278 is an example of LTF application of your earlier hypothesis you posted on your thread with the use of A"whatever"R. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...5#post12401925 I made the post#273 to show that the kumo is the only non-shifting standard mt4 indicator that paints on future bars. About ichimoku kumo, it's best not to discuss that on either threads.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
@skyway -- okay. I still don't get the point. And I still don't think the ADR can be chopped into little pieces. I mean, yes, you can chop it into little pieces and use pieces as offsets but, so what. I can use @George's M1 TMA offsets as well and get things to work. The ADR is real. It's physical. It's explainable. People go home at the end of the day. They had tasks to perform. They had transactions to complete. If the banks and large financial institutions worked around the clock then that would be different. The ADR is like a cup of water. It is empty at the beginning of the day and full at the end. There is no such thing as 25% ADR that starts empty and fills to 25% ADR by a known time.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Correct, D1 100% ADR or W1 100% ADR. Somehow arbitrary curve fitted % of ADR is used on both threads - You readily accept it. You do not accept(reject) A"whatever"R based on ATR for whatever reason you have put forward. That's my point. Note - almost nobody use BD ADR indicator strategy with D1 100% ADR or W1 100% ADR. Why ?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
" There is no such thing as 25% ADR that starts empty and fills to 25% ADR by a known time." Exactly correct, so then we have the ATR, the ADR's more flexible sibling always looking what the current price is doing, not some made up percentage of its bigger sibling, but the real deal working hard at the Coal Face

--- 帖子 #284 ---
@skyway -- wait a second. It came up because people like you and others kept pushing LTF. I've written I have nothing against it because it obviously can work (since the BD strategy is so robust). But it's just an "offshoot" of the original strategy. Not true. I do. I will only use W1. Right. I remember you were the troublemaker -- as usual...

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Tbh, this is my side of the supposed troublemaker story. Yes, you were adamant to lock the indicator to only D1 and W1 to keep us on the same page. You changed it because of people like me irritated you enough. At that point of the thread, I somehow sensed that with D1 and W1 BD ADR setting, the thread will die very fast due to the lack of signals. Boring, nobody testing. So armed with this motive to continue generate interest to explore further this BD ADR application with the help from forum members, I took a risk to introduce this window into LTF with that contentious post#4440 - I had your project success in mind. See what has happened since the "gamblers" visited in droves into both threads with their creative fiddling "offshoots"... Now, with Robot Trader, I try to turn Titanic around to it's proper path of A"whatever"R based on ATR instead of arbitrary curve fitted % of ADR, with much lesser incentive to the crowd this time.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Yep -- you were right (as usual) and that is exactly what happened...

--- 帖子 #287 ---
@Robot Trader -- I really want to agree, but I still count. The ATR is different. There is no physical explanation -- like people going home and banks closing at the end of the day. It fluctuates. It has different values at different times. It can't accommodate spikes. Can it be used? Sure, of course. People use it all the time. But does it have the same properties as the ADR -- I still say 'no'.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Create the R4M-AD/H4/H1Indi in the same mould as R4M-ADRIndi, it will become your best and most popular creation. If you do, pls allow for user input to width, style and color. TQVM in advance. Note - this indicator will compete directly with your R4M-BD-ADR indicator.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi R4M, Please wait I just need to get the horse from out of the paddock Let me agree with you the ADR and its merits are not being questioned, it is using a percentage of them on the LTF's what is being debated, because a percentage of the ADR (which is a slow moving Daily Average) will never perform like the ATR, it is impossible for it to do so. Another way to look at it is the ATR is a building block of sorts that will over time fill the glass and become a ADR. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #290 ---
@Robot Trader -- so, you know, that's an interesting statement. And I think maybe that is the crux of where we disagree. I don't think the ADR is built from ATR building blocks. I understand the ATR is a metric for a recent range -- but you can't apply the ATR from last Monday at 1:32 PM to next Wednesday at 10:11 AM. On the other hand, I can take the ADR from Monday and apply it to Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. Not only for this week, but also for next week, and the week after. And that's because it has a real, physical basis. Banks and financial institutions close at the end of the day. People perform tasks and go home. It is a daily phenomenon. The ATR has no physical backing. It's just a computation using recent prices. The ATR from one day can not be used the next day. The ATR that you just calculated will not survive the upcoming price spike because the recent prices used to compute your current ATR did not include a price spike. ATR is a metric and can be used. But it is not as robust as ADR. Maybe that's a better way to describe the difference -- robustness .

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Update on the earlier EURJPY, that's what this new R4M-AD/H4/H1Indi can do with much less shifting that's more related to current price movement.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi R4M, Don't you see what you have described is the very reason the ATR should be used on the LTF's, we are not interested in next week, we are not interested in even tomorrow, we are only ever interested in the period we are trading that day. So if the TMA is calculated using the H4 ATR and we are trading the M15, we will see spikes based of the most resent price movement rather that using a percentage of the ADR to try and replicate what is really the ATR, this is the point I am trying to get across. You are happy to use a percentage of the ADR to try and replicate the ATR, why is this, we are not trading the D1 TF so your statement about the ADR just doesn't hold water, no pun intended Regards RT

--- 帖子 #293 ---
This arguement betwen ADR and ATR may never end. So i suggest making the percentage of ADR to be dependent on ATR so everyone can be happy.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
@Robot Trader -- okay, maybe we are getting closer. I think we may have a problem in communicating. I don't care about LTF's. @skyway brought it up, people started experimenting and found it worked using some % of the ADR, and @bishopdotun even went to the trouble of figuring out the best settings. For me, the BD strategy has always been about W1 / D1 using 100% ADR -- that's the strategy. Now, if you are saying that if we are going to use some arbitrary % of the ADR for LTFs, then why not use ATR instead, then I have no problem with it. To me, if you are not going to use W1 and 100% ADR, then you can use whatever offset you like. It could be the number of weeks until my next birthday -- I don't care. If it seems to work then go for it. When I kept saying you can't chop the ADR into smaller pieces then wasn't it clear I wasn't referring to LTFs? I know that W1 100% ADR doesn't work at LTFs -- there would be no trades. For now -- I'm sticking with % ADR because that is what is currently implemented. I have found my Holy Grail. I'm done searching. Finito. You guys can continue your search because that's all you've ever known and you can't stop. @bishopdotun has handed me, you, us, this most amazing strategy. I've implemented it and shared it with everyone. And we couldn't have been more transparent. And, yet, it's still not good enough. I continue to receive PMs suggesting that maybe such and such indicator would work better. Everyone is still searching for the Holy Grail -- though they'll say they aren't because it doesn't exist. I've heard it said that even if you were to offer people the Holy Grail they'll still keep searching for more. And it's true. We've proved it here and now. I know people are grateful and appreciative of the work from myself and @bishopdotun. So it's not about lack of appreciation. It just sort of surprises me that even though you are holding something special in your hand, you still can't stop (searching for more).

--- 帖子 #295 ---
The D1 100% and W1 100% setting of R4M-BD-ADR indicator will paint exactly the same on whatever timeframe this indicator is placed on.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
@skyway -- yes, you are correct (as usual).

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi R4M, Another saying comes to mind which is " Much always wants More " Well I accept that you are happy with the BD D1 Strategy although I am not sure it is really any better than trading the LTF's' its just that there are fewer signals, so members can't report any negatives that quickly. It is just as well I never became the OP of the LTF thread, because it would have been short lived. I wish you all the best with your D1 trading Best Regards RT

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Tbf and tbh, I am aware of the basis of your decision. I was merely raising a point(as usual). Best wishes to your and Bishopdotun trading.

These are H4 bands...... from NIH indicator Focus on the outer band. That’s what skyway &amp; RT is looking for. We will have a deeper discussion later. Which of the 2 do you like?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
The "BD Time Frame" parameter should remain the same therefore giving a longer period of time to show the spike through the horizontal bands, it is the "Percent ADR" parameter that is being debated, should it be a percentage of a larger more slowly moving Daily Average or should it be the ATR that is more reflective of current PA movement in the market. So with the horizontal bands in your 2 chart examples not being equal to say 10080 in length, then the spikes are not poking through on a like for like when comparing it to the R4M-BD-ADR indicator

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Yes, I do fully agree...forward testing on live data is the only way to judging this system R4M-BD-ADR system. We know BT's on Strategy Tester are unreliable and looking back on historical charts due to the band shiftings as well. Unfortunately, AllPairs EA doesn't work correctly at least with me. The Dashboard EA did provide 6 very good signals today, AllPairs EA took just one of them. Atm I'm doing not much manual trading in front of the screen also because of a heat wave here in Germany with up to 42° C. hence I do rather prefer swimmimg instead... ! IMHO...the discussion ADR%/ATR doesn't bring us along at this stage as long as we don't have a fully working AllPairs EA to allow us forward tests on 28 pairs simultaneously!

@T4Trade -- what does GMT have to do with MT4 acting weird? And how do you "adjust" the GMT. GMT refers to you broker's server time. How are you going to adjust that? I think you are sorta lost. Why are you posting here? Do you have a question about the BD strategy or just letting us know you sometimes wrestle with MT4?

@Beren -- considering there is such a thing as the Internet. Considering there is such a thing as Google search. Considering that MT4 has extensive documentation. Considering all the threads here at FF about how to install and use an EA.

@Robot Trader -- I don't understand why this has grown so complicated. This is simply another "Envelope-type" strategy with a midline -- not much different than @George's TMA. Where is @parisboy when you need him? There is a midline. It could probably be the midline from any of more than a few dozen "Envelope-type" strategies. The midline represents a fair-value / equilibrium price the system always returns to. In fact, every system I've ever seen has some sort of equilibrium that it returns to. In addition to a midline we need an upper and lower band to trade away from. Same as @George. @George chose 8 levels of offsets -- determined empirically and specific for GBPJPY. He used these to rank how extreme a spike was and then trade (or not trade) accordingly. Here we have one offset -- the ADR -- to create one upper and one lower band. Now, if you want to create other types of offsets based on other indicators -- or even use a different midline -- there are many variations you can choose from that will probably work fine. But that's a lot of work and testing to go through. And if that's what you like to do then it can keep you busy for a long time and you never have to worry about running out of variations to try. There will always be another variation. There will always be another way to choose offsets from a midline. Apologies to @bishopdotun if we don't necessarily see eye-to-eye on this, but I can summarize the strategy in one sentence: "Wait for the ADR cup to become 100% full, and then trade away". That's the strategy in a nutshell. Of course we've added some details that vary or refine that description. And, of course, you can fiddle with settings to create other offsets that work -- one or more. You can even use @George's offsets. But if you want to explain to your grandmother the logic behind why the strategy works, then I think that one sentence description is accurate. For me, there is no such thing as "Wait until the ADR cup is 16% full", or 35% full. At that point you're just fiddling with different numeric thresholds like @George's empirically-determined 8 TMA levels. And if you want to create different offsets based on ATR that's fine. I thought you were advocating to replace 100% ADR with some arbitrary ATR offset. ATR requires 3 parameters -- multiplier, half-length and period. And you want me or someone to work out the best parameters for various LTFs and 28 pairs? Just the thought makes me shake my head in wonder...

@Robot Trader -- below are screen shots and commentry for GBPUSD back tests I ran using OHLC data. My data horizon is different than yours because my broker's data doesn't go back as far as your tick data. But the other settings are the same: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So, this looks quite different than your result, right? It might be the difference between tick data and OHLC data, or it might be the different data horizons. So, what does this tell us? I don't know. Tick data and OHLC data yield different results? Perhaps. The data horizon makes a difference? Perhaps. Regardless, in the end, no conclusion can be drawn. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The above is a similar test but I allowed the optimizer to choose better StopLossFractionADR and TakeProfitFractionADR settings. Not the greatest, but still vastly improved from the previous test. So, what does this tell us. I don't know. That settings make a difference -- probably yes -- but we already knew that. @Robot Trader -- in your tick data back test you chose to use StopLossFractionADR=1, and TakeProfitFractionADR=1.5. Where did those come from? How did you know those would give the best results for GBPUSD-M30? We know that SL and TP have a big effect. Also, in previous posts I had suggested this strategy seems to work better with pairs with large ADRs -- which is why I was using GBPNZD for my back tests. Why did you choose to focus on GBPUSD? I'm glad you and others are doing back testing -- it does help to confirm that the code can open and close trades without crashing. But in the end I don't know what the take home message is. It seems what has been shown is that back testing under different data horizons and settings yield different back testing results? But didn't we already know that?

@skyway -- no. There is no other cup. There is only a 100% ADR cup. And that is because there is this concept of people who work at banks and financial institutions performing their tasks, completing transactions, and going home at the end of the day. In the real world there really is an "end of the day", and the ADR reflects that. When the NY session closes activity drops way down. And then things start up again the next day beginning at the Asian Open. There is a physical and commercial basis for the ADR. There is no physical or commercial basis for A"whatever"R. As for " We don't want messy overflows." -- I'm sorry to break it to you: Into each life a little rain must fall (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow).

--- 帖子 #316 ---
There are three-fold problems to address with 100% ADR cup, 1. The cup may not get completely filled so you will still be waiting, or 2. The cup may be over-filled, and 3. This overfilled cup may not reverse during the foreseable future. This means we need to know the size of the cup, we need to know the percentage fill that will trigger a intended reverse action.

Hi R4M, Question, when we use for example 16% of the ADR on the LTF, how are the TP/SL values set, are they a percentage of the 16%? therefore a percentage of a percentage Also replacing the 16% ADR with a ATR based on a true LTF time period is very simple, you just have a drop down window and pick (example) H4, so now the EA is using the most recent H4 bars for its calculations and just as important it is applying a ATR TP/SL percent against how the bars are currently forming, this can never be the case when using the 16% of ADR with a look back period of 20 days, therefore how can this TP/SL ever apply to the current cup when trading the LTF. It is only complicated at your end, I am just a simple person so there is no way that I could make it complicated, if you don't believe me just ask the wife she will confirm how simple I am Regards RT

--- 帖子 #330 ---
HI R4M, I asked BD if he had any pair in particular he wanted me to run the BT on and he said no so I continued with the GBPUSD because it is one of the most traded pairs with low spread and a good ATR, remember we are trading the lower TF's and not your ADR large range GBPNZD on the Daily and this could be part of the difference in the use of ADR v ATR a pair can have a smaller ADR, but a larger more volatile ATR on the LTF's within each trading day. I used TP = 1.5 &amp; SL = 1 because if the EP the EA are finding are good then why would you want to risk more on a bad trade when there are many more good ones to come, with the TP I was looking to get out before the opposite band but after the Midline. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #331 ---
@Robot Trader -- the TP/SL are a percentage of the ADR. What would 20% of 16%ADR mean? @Robot Trader -- and how do you suppose the EA performs calculations on H4 bars? Do you really think it just happens automagically? The code would have to change in order to accommodate different combinations of settings. And how would that work with the current %ADR setting? And what about the NumberOfDays setting? And what about settings for ATR -- what should we use for ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period? And what about SL/TP as you point out -- are they calculated from an ADR, ATR -- and if ATR, what settings do we use? Would they differ by time frame? There is a big gap between saying -- "Couldn't we just use the best ATR settings" versus implementing the best ATR settings. In fact, you already have such an indicator. @Georges TMA. His bands were configured using his "secret" ATRMultipliers, HalfLengths and Period settings. Don't you remember the profanity thrown at me by @moodybot when I shared the settings that one of the inner circle had shared with me? Why not just use @George's TMA settings instead of the BD indicator? Look it -- for people who are professional traders they live and breath this stuff. They don't want it to ever end. Even when they have something that works they'll continue to search for more because that's what they enjoy. I'm different -- I want it to end. I want to find something that works, automate it, and then move on. I don't want to be a professional trader who is always looking for the next edge.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi R4M, I have already said that I understand you are happy with your D1 trading and wished you all the best with that. When I say it is just a case of picking H4 from the drop down window I am talking from the uses point of view, obviously the code that makes that selection possible takes effort from you and not me. That's why I employ a coder, he is happy to workout the code to achieve the specification I provide him with and then if it does not work it is my money that is wasted. I have EA's that I am happy with, but the reason I am here which I have already explained to you is because I do not have a successful reversal EA, I have 2 EA's that can trade reversals and make money for months at a time, but then they will lose 20% of the account (or more) and that is not what I am looking for from an EA. I do have some ideas regarding one of my EA's where I will look to add further parameters, which might just give it a better reversal trading win rate and stop those 20% plus losses. So I guess in some respects you are right, when trading with EA's you have spare time, because the effort you put into making a profitable EA gives you that time to look at other parts of trading that you have not yet been successful in and that for me is reversal trading with an EA. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #333 ---
@Robot Trader -- I have an idea. Pretend I'm your programmer. Can you write a specification for the indicator you have in mind and if it is not too time-consuming then I would consider implementing it. Also, how does what you are suggesting differ from @George's TMA? George's methodology traded reversals. So far it's not clear to me how your use of ATR would differ from his -- other than his settings were top secret.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi R4M, Thank you for your offer, but I don't think we have that type of relationship, my coder asks the right questions and I do not have to keep explaining myself. I have already uploaded a PDF specification that was given to my coder regarding money management and lot sizes for another EA of mine. These money management parameters are more important than ADR v ATR and could be applied to your existing EA, which from BD's point of view was to be the next stage once the best possible Trigger had been achieved (including sorting out any bugs), so I believe you have stated this is now the case and the EA is finished from a Trigger prospective. So from the PDF I have provided can you understand the specification and code the parameters, because this could be the big difference between my relationship with my coder that spans 10 years and yourself, my coder gets what I am wanting to achieve from the specification and my EA is coded and working. I have tried to explain the difference between ADR and ATR for the smaller TF's on many occasions, my coder would understand and code accordingly he would not need a specification because he would know the difference between the two types of indicators and how he would need to apply the logic to the EA and also give parameter options to allow the user to experiment with different setting/values, just based upon the correspondence alone. Regards RT

Your best bet for a reliable reversal EA is described by R4M. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...5#post12401925 If you implement this strategy on R4M-BD-ADR 100% D1 or W1 you get too few signals. To overcome that you implement this exact strategy on shorter cycles. 1. ADR for the outermost band and AH4R for the faster band, and 2. AH4R for the outermost band and AH1R for the faster band. CC as the optional additional filter

Hi Skyway, You were the one that got R4M to unlock the EA to allow members to experiment with the lower TF's, I just said that I would help, which turned into me being offered the role of being the OP for the LTF's, which in turn never happened, so I guess your request is a valid one, but I am not sure the specification is comprehensible, maybe I am wrong and R4M will get what you want without any further questions Regards RT

--- 帖子 #338 ---
@Robot Trader -- I understand specifications. I also understand the difference between ADR and ATR. ATR requires 3 parameters -- you would need to provide these to your programmer. What are the 3 ATR parameters you would provide to your programmer? Also, do the ATR parameters change with TF -- if so, what are their values. Do the ATR parameters change according to the symbol -- if so, what are their values.

Hi R4M, My coder uses the standard ATR indicator and I have the following parameter inputs in respect to setting TP/SL/TSL and I can tell you what they do from a user input point of view. S1_TakeProfit = 0.8 (Take Profit is 80% of the average of S1_TakeProfitATR, now this is dynamic in two ways not only is the original TP dynamic based on the most recent price movement, but even after the trade is opened, because while ever the trade is open it still does its look back period and adjusts the TP based on the most recent calculation of closed Candles) S1_TakeProfitATR = 5 (The EA is using the last 5 closed Candles to workout the ATR) S1_StopLoss = 1.0 (The Stoploss is 100% of the average of S1_StoplossATR, now this is dynamic in two ways not only is the original SL dynamic based on the most recent price movement, but even after the trade is opened, because while ever the trade is open it still does its look back period and adjusts the SL based on the most recent calculation of closed Candles) S1_StoplossATR = 3 (The EA is using the last 3 closed Candles to workout the ATR) S1_TrailingStopAct = 0.10 (Based on the TP the EA must reach 10% of its value before the TSL is activated) S1_TrailingStopDist = 2.0 (The Trailing Stoploss is 200% of the average of S1_TrailingStopATR, now this is dynamic in two ways not only is the original TSL dynamic based on the most recent price movement, but even after the trade is opened, because while ever the trade is open it still does its look back period and adjusts the TSL based on the most recent calculation of closed Candles) important note: Once the TSL is activated to takes over from the SL S1_TrailingStopATR = 3 (The EA is using the last 3 closed Candles to workout the ATR) Regarding the TMA Bands % of the ADR, all I am saying is that this % should be replaced with the ATR, for a user defined TF (a drop down window with a selection of TF's) and we have an additional parameter that allows the user to select the look back period for the ATR calculations. If you are asking how the calculations for the ATR should computed then just allow manual input of all the possible parameters that make up the standard ATR indicator. Regards RT EDIT: The ATR does not need to know the Currency Pair that it is trading, because its calculations are always dependent on the price movement of whatever Currency Pair it is trading.

Guys, one question, what's the logic in "Consecutive Candles" for opening conditions? ____ Also guys, I was thinking about "Momentum filter" for a proper entry with lower DD, so we can place SL closer to lose less money on fail. Can this be a QQE indicator? I attach example for LTF scalping, but this can be for HTF too. Point is not to take current qqe values (it is changing) but previous on next candle open. Logic is something like: [Touched top line] -&gt; [wait till qqeBlue &lt; qqeRed] -&gt; [SELL] [Touched bottom line] -&gt; [wait till qqeBlue &gt; qqeRed] -&gt; [BUY]

--- 帖子 #346 ---
@Robot Trader -- let's say I'm a user and I want to trade EURUSD-M30. What values should I use? Providing indicators without settings doesn't really help. We all have access to indicators. In order for the indicators to be useful for trading we have to know what settings to use to create the upper and lower TMA bands. In order to create a trading system for 28 pairs and multiple time frames I would need to know what settings to use for all combinations. @George had very specific, top-secret settings for TMA / ATR trading on GBPJPY-M1. What ATR settings are we going to use for the variation of the BD strategy that instead uses ATR?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi R4M, I am not going to tell you how to trade, but I might share a SET file with you You just can't help asking too many questions that are not relevant to the coding, (my coder just produces the goods, without questions that's the relationship) You just need to code the Indicator/EA with flexible parameters and let the members experiment. And if you don't want to do it that's fine, like I have already said I respect the fact you are happy with what you have achieved. Regards RT

Back in early 2000, Igor introduced this Adr strategy. Igor on forex TSD and CJA on FF have coded a number of useful ADR indicators. I have been trading weekly Adr range on GBPJPY since 2005. This robust classic strategy needs patient traders. And of late conducive market environment. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=11494 ADR vs ATR argument has been going on since Igor coded the first rudimentary indicator.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I hate to do this type of contentious post BUT for the purpose to spur others to explore deeper into this BD reversal strategy, here is the result of short cycle test into the validity of R4m reversal theory he posted earlier. Take a look. You can conduct your own test on any timeframe - the % setting has to be logical. Use 2 indicators created by R4m. Like Robot Trader, my interest in BD is in it's reversal strategy.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
@Robot Trader -- so this is the crux of the issue. Your coder chooses some settings that are unbeknownst to you. It's not about "flexible parameters" -- that's a copout to say that to me. If you are going to trade a reversal strategy using TMA bands then you absolutely must know in advance what the offsets should be from the midline. Are you really suggesting that a better trading solution would be to switch to an indicator where everyone has to figure out -- on their own -- what the best TMA offsets should be? How would that be any different than the TMA that @George used? It sounds like you are looking for an indicator where you can fiddle with settings and choose band offsets that look good to you. That is not a trading system. That is a diagnostic tool. It would have no use to anyone who wants to trade because the settings have not yet been figured out.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi R4M, Lets take the current indicator there is a parameter Percent ADR, this allows the user to offset the bands by a standard deviation of X, it is totally flexible. So I am simply (so very simply) asking you to not use the ADR for this calculation but replace it with the ATR for a time frame that the user can select. So if I am wanting to trade the M15, I want the ability to do the following. A) Select an ATR TF (example I pick H4) B) Select a lookback period (example I pick 10) c) Select a offset value (example I pick 2, so the bands are 2x StdDev away from the Mean) Now if you want to apply some sort of variable/dynamic bands, that is constantly regulating itself based on the current movement of price well that would be taking it to the next level, I am not asking for that, because it is hard enough just explaining the simple things. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #352 ---
@Robot Trader -- it is not a simple matter of replacing ADR with ATR. The TMA has 3 parameters -- ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period. ADR does not have additional parameters (other than NumberOfDays, which we default to 20). So, if one is going to replace ADR with ATR, then you also have to supply the ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period for the TMA. What values should I use for ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period? EDIT: @Robot Trader -- I appreciate your patience in going 'round and 'round in this exercise with me. We're talking past one another because I approach it from a coding perspective and you approach it as an experienced trader. Also, you keep ignoring my request for which ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period parameters to use. I'm willing to continue with you, but if you wish to drop it then that's also okay with me.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Live example, what happens to this latest signal off a "waterfall". Look at your chart. Edit - 2nd picture shows the result, not sure what happens after the start of new hour.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi R4M, With respect to the Half Length, this again needs to be a user input, it does not need to be hard coded, it may change based upon TF, but 56 could be a default setting. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #355 ---
CJA has coded a MTF indicator whose input says days but actually it refers to TF (any period) https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...57#post8794657 May be worth taking a look at it and find out whether in short-term trading any ADR cup can be full. I use only weekly ADR and have no idea about whether ADR strategy works for any period other than daily or weekly.

Thank you simnz, that's what I'm looking for. Edit - the one I'm looking for is to automatically read the start time or time shift.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
@skyway,try sticking the MM FX RSI Momentum indicator supplied by robots4me on your charts, it keeps you out of 'waterfalls' but the trade off is it cuts down on the number of trades you can take...

--- 帖子 #358 ---
CJ indicator does not use bands of any kind. It just marks the probable ADR % price points. RBA is a huge improvement on it. R4Me has done a wonderful job and I no longer use my ramshackle plot on the chart as described below; I overlay it with macro and micro bands based on the size of pips plotted by a Pips channel indicator coded by Mikko. The width of the two channels is manually input. I use weekly Range and Daily range based on the last 20 days. Attached Image (click to enlarge) BD-ADR is a boon for the serious manual trader having patience. An EA will not be that much useful if it does not provide risk control and make it fully automated to trade and manage positions. Trading for short time-frame does require EA for entry itself. The ADR dashboard can be used as a trade Screener and its value can be enhanced by incorporating Murrey Math Lines as suggested by Parisboy. Confluence of the two ADR and MM is another factor to consider. Future vertical timeline for probable reversal or pullback can also be drawn by some formula which takes into account the period (days) taken by the past few Days to reach the pips range (open-close) divided by a 25% or 50% or 75% ratio etc.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
@Robot Trader -- yes, it may change based on TF. It may change based on pair. It may change according to market conditions. You're missing the point. You're suggesting that given a naked indicator, let's start at the beginning and let everyone figure out the details -- i.e. the best settings -- themselves. That's not a trading system. You already have the necessary indicators -- you posted them above. Why not use those to figure out the best settings?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
KISS.... You have something this plain simple.... but the search for the holy grail continues endlessly. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you traded this system judiciously this week, you should have at least 1000 pips banked. Note to self: Stop searching....Start making pips....

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Waste time figuring out the best settings - bad advice. Curvefitting exercise is a total waste of precious time and ones life. There is no holy grail setting. Stop that nonsense. Note - my earlier posts above is to look into r4m reversal hypothesis he posted on his thread. I test hypothesis, not settings. ***About settings of whatever indicator. The constant setting has to work on all assets, instruments, timeframes and market conditions. Universal setting. No such thing as selective setting, selective pairs, selective timeframes and selective market condition. That is curvefitting.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
@parisboy -- thank you. And it was sort of a rhetorical question. I don't want to be the one to figure out the settings. If we are to go from a working system that uses ADR to one that uses ATR then I want to be told exactly what settings to use. The TMA indicator requires 3 parameters -- ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period. ATRMultipler is a floating point number, HalfLength and Period are integers. I need to know those 3 numbers. And, of course, I know that no one knows what those numbers are. Which is why we keep going 'round and 'round. I'm continuing with this exercise in the hope that along the way people will slap their forehead and go, "Oh, okay, now I get it". Attaching an indicator onto a chart is not sufficient to trade. You need to identify Entry points. And in order to identify Entry points you need rules. And in order to implement rules you need algebraic equations. And in order for an algebraic equation to compute a value you have to exchange those empty constants with actual values. EX: y = mx + b is the equation for a straight line, right? Where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. And suppose I say "Hey, @parisboy, here is the equation for a line -- please draw me a line". What are you going to do? You'll look at me like I'm crazy. Why? Because I also need to tell you what 'm' and 'b' are. 'm' and 'b' are the settings that you need values for in order to draw a line. If I were to tell you that 'm' is 5 and b is '-1' then you could draw a line. But without me providing values for 'm' and 'b' then there is no line. Without 'm' and 'b' it's just an abstraction. To go from abstraction to reality one needs to substitute 'm' and 'b' with real values. Similarly -- in order to draw TMA I need an ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period. @Robot Trader keeps telling me to use 'm' and 'b', and I keep asking for actual values. Without actual values for those parameters then there is no TMA.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
@skyway -- there's some miscommunication here. I think you are supportive of the BD strategy, right? There's little to no curve-fitting going on since it relies on ADR. And I'm assuming your comments were primarily addressing the suggested switch to ATR along with all the new (unknown) settings it would require and attendant curve-fitting issues that would arise. And your comment that "This search can cost years of a persons life." sounds like that is a cost you would prefer not to have to endure -- though, others might actually favor. So, to be clear -- are you with us or agin us? The reason I ask is because sometimes your comments are sarcastic and sometimes not, and not everyone is tuned into sarcasm.

@bishopdotun -- that is very kind of you to say. I do know people appreciate our efforts. Also I benefit greatly, as well. Because of this thread and the feedback and test results I am so much further along in my own journey. OMG -- back in April there was no way I could have imagined I'd be posting a comment like this, let alone reading something like your wrote. It's nice to be appreciated and I can read between the lines and see that people are interested. And that brings me much satisfaction. But we also stand on the shoulders of giants. Everything I've done is copying from others. And since they may not be around to receive the credit due them, then I'm not comfortable receiving credit that rightfully belongs to others. And, just so people don't forget -- I was stumbling around with the SpikeHunter indicator when @bishopdotun drops out of nowhere with this new idea. @bishopdotun -- this is your baby. I'm just standing on your shoulders...

So do you use an additional indicator to further improve entries or is that what you are looking for?

I wrote earlier that I have this motive of success for your project. There is curvefitting if we are not careful. D1 and W1 100% setting(there shouldn't be % setting) with fixed constant 20period ADR has no curvefitting. LTF arbitrary % settings is where curvefitting comes in. ATR will mean new curvefitting selection. Selective timeframes, example H1, M30, M15 is curvefitting. Selective pairs with larger ADR is curvefitting. We must understand that we can avoid curvefitting if we remain fixed and constant in our selection with universal application. Lets say we select 100% setting(no % setting in the first place) with 20period ADR applied onto daily timeframe. Our pair choice is GBPNZD, GBPAUD for their larger ADR. No matter what the result, we stick to this selection. Large sample size over the long run will confirm this BD strategy if there is an edge for both large ADR pairs. Whether it works on arbitrary settings or LTF or other pairs or market conditions, we are not able to make any conclusion. The test for BD strategy on daily timeframe should include all 28pairs. I am a divergent trend trader. Contrarian convergent trading on short timeframe(lower than daily) without fundamentals consideration purely based on chart technical analysis is outside my scope. I am here to learn. Like Robot Trader I am interested in your thread because of the reversal convergent focus of your BD strategy - I wrote that earlier. I am interested in concept hypothesis rather than indicators and settings - why does this reversal convergent TA work.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi R4M, No I am not missing the point, if anything it is completely the other way around. Let get to the basics of what is being discussed, you have your Daily BD System which you believe totally works and your search is over, great well done. Now for the LTF, that system is no longer a System, because we are using a percentage of the ADR this is a parameter that is not fixed it is totally variable, please correct me if I am wrong in that statement? And if my statement is true (and I only deal in Yes/No) then what are you really trying to prove to me? just because the ATR as got a few more variables, does not stop it from being better at following current PA than a percentage of the slow moving ADR. I am saying why use a percentage of the ADR (a Daily average of a period of some 20 days or whatever the user inputs) for trading discussions on the LTF. You are happy with the ADR percentage, because really you see no merit in trading the Daily System on the LTF, it is just for greedy traders that just can't stop searching for the Holy Grail. So lets stop discussing it and move onto Money Management and too many trades being opened at the same level increasing risk to the account. Regards RT EDIT: The ATR indicator that I uploaded didn't have "Half Length" parameter maybe it was hard coded, however this is where you are completely missing the point , I am not looking for you to replace your existing System indicator with an ATR TMA type indicator, (I have never said that) I just want the calculations based on a basic ATR indicator (no TMA involved) so why can't the calculations just be the same as how the present indicator works out the Daily average, but instead of using Daily Candles for its calculations, it uses H4 Candles for calculating its average, this must be better than using a percentage of the Daily to workout the most current price movement on the H4. This request can't be that difficult to code, it is not involving Half Length parameters or anything else, it is just replacing Daily Candles with H4 Candles, how is that so difficult and why is it resulting in is so many unnecessary questions.

Any Reversal convergent TA trading requires deep pockets and strong momentum. ADR based system measures price move exhaustion in terms of ADR and are effective only on a couple of symbols which are fit candidates for mean reversion. It is easier to follow and a trader just needs to focus on risk and drawdown management. I prefer to spend time on risk management than entry guidance. My interest in this thread is because of the tools being ccoded which make my job easier. In case of certain symbols I would like to wait for 400% glass full before concluding that it is ripe for reversal. There is least focus on risk management here at FF and wonder whether there would be one here too.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
R4m, it's the weekend and I investigated deeper into the BD ADR indicator and setting. Take a look at the 2 images below with BD D1. The 1st is 100% of delta setting. The 2nd delta setting is reverse engineered based on the logic you posted. It's your logic and algo, so you have no problem to understand this. Do the 2 images tell you something ? It taught me how to reverse engineer the appropriate setting for all timeframes.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
@Robot Trader -- I don't know what that means. Where is it written that using a percentage of ADR is / isn't a system. But, regardless, LTF is a bastardization of the BD strategy. The only reason it exists is because people kept clamoring for it and I unlocked the time frame and %ADR parameters. The fact I unlocked them by no means suggested I was interested in new indicators to further enhance LTF trading. Because I need the frickin settings -- ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period. ADR is a special case of ATR where those are already known. If we don't use the special case then you have to tell me what settings to use.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
...which brings us to your preferred D1 timeframe with proper calibration. I use the original CC. Note - the smaller band is the D1 band and the larger band is the W1 band, .

--- 帖子 #377 ---
@skyway -- it's late and I'm tired. Don't make my brain work. Asking me if it tells me something is reminiscent of @moodybot's style -- only answer questions with another question. That screen shot makes no sense to me. The outer yellow steps are never penetrated by the price. So -- what use are they? Also -- I see that you continue to like using the R4M-ADRIndi indicator -- and I'm flattered. But you know that it shifts vertically throughout the day. So, treating it as a static indicator is very misleading because in real-time your charts would not look like what you've posted.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
The thing I want you to look at is your D1 100% setting in the top picture post#374. That's the point, in the top picture post#374 it's your D1 100% setting. You tell us what's the meaning of this 100% setting that price most likely will not penetrate the bands ? The outer yellow steps is the W1 band. I monitor both D1 and W1 on the same chart. Edit - if you say this W1 band "are never penetrated by the price", are you aware how bad will your W1 100% setting be ? Put it on your chart to see it. Yes the ADRIndi shifts throughout the day, the same with any ADR high/low level indicator that's been created earlier by other coders. It's not a static indicator and it's misleading. Your BD ADR band is also shifting throughout the day as the TMA mid-line shifts. Note - the only thing that remains unchanged is ADR which is the 20period ATR of the daily timeframe.

Hi R4M, You really are hard work no wonder talking to George never helped you in anyway, there is no secret strategy it is exactly the same strategy, I am not hiding anything, we just simply replace calculations of Daily Candles and replace them with calculations of (for example) the H4 Candles, because on the LTF we are using a percentage of the Daily average to mimic an H4 period of candles (example only) So lets compare the two. Existing Method A) Daily Candles with a look back of 20 candles gives an average of 250 pips we take for example 16% of this average to compute the H4 Bands for trading on the M15 ATR Method. B) We select (example) H4 ATR average calculated with a look back of 20 candles gives an average of 100 pips, so we can now compute the Bands based on this average there is no 16% required, because we know the true average of the H4 for trading on the M15. How simple can it get. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #380 ---
@Robot Trader -- I don't want to insult you. I have too much respect for you and I am indebted because you (and @skyway) always had my back with the @George BS. But I'm afraid you don't understand how indicators work. You must give me settings, otherwise you are simply referring to an abstraction -- a representation. When you code an indicator that will be used for detecting Entry points then you really must provide the settings that will be used. We can go around and around. But nothing will happen without the settings. We are not going to leave it up to several hundred people to figure out the settings on their own. That's what @George did. And you can describe all the computations you like. But those computations can not happen without the ATR settings -- ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period. ADR is special case of ATR -- it also has those 3 settings. But because it is a special case then the settings are known. EDIT: Also, why do you keep bringing up 16% ADR. I'm way past that. I don't care about ADR percentages. There is no such thing as 16% ADR -- it's just some number pulled out of a hat that sort of works at LTFs. There is only ADR.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi R4M, You are probably 100% correct (like I have said I am simple) I just don't understand why the ADR which is a Daily average, so must be based on Open and Closed prices (or whatever method) can't be modified to look back and instead of looking at Daily Candles it looks at H4 candles. I have other EA's where I can place them on any TF and the EA will workout the ATR for that time frame, with no special parameter inputs from me and like I have already stated they are just basic MT4 indicators builtin to the EA. Do you at least understand why I feel a percentage of the Daily to workout the H4 is not correct? Regards RT

--- 帖子 #382 ---
@Robot Trader -- yes, I do. I was not the inventor of 16% ADR. I've said many times it's just some number pulled out of a hat that works at LTFs. If you have a better way to deal with LTFs then fine -- no objection. I am not attached to percentages of ADR because they have no meaning. Also, I am not interested in LTFs unless someone hands me the entire meal on a dish. I am not interested in figuring out settings. And I know that won't happen because it's a ton of work, which is another reason why ADR (that is 100% ADR) is attractive. As a special case of ATR, its settings are known. There is nothing to figure out or compute.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
@skyway -- you're using a way old indicator on H4. Without knowing all the settings I have no idea what you are trying to show me. Below is what a GBPUSD-H4 chart looks like today -- there are enough Entry signals. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #384 ---
This is how the D1 setting looks like.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
@skyway -- I agree, those are crappy settings. There are no trades. And the point is what -- that crappy settings lead to no trades?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Crappy settings that led to settings pulled out of the hat. OR , interpret and comprehend what role ADR and TMA play in your algo then use the meaningful setting. Widest band - W1, 2nd widest band - D1, inner band - H4 and ADRIndi all on one chart for comparison.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
@skyway -- it's an H1 chart and you're losing me. What do you think of the W1 / 100% ADR / H4 chart I posted above? Would you consider it good or bad?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Here's what I think. The high is 1.25351 and the low is 1.23841. The ADR delta is 0.01510 What is the actual W1 ATR with period 20 ? The answer lies there.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Nope. 0.01510 is the delta between the High and Low for that day. The ADR is the average delta over the most recent 20 days . There's a difference. I don't have a clue. Is this a @George riddle?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
No riddle, put on the ATR on your week chart. BD ADR week ADR delta is 0.01510 vs 20 period week ATR of 0.02120

--- 帖子 #391 ---
@skyway -- sorry, I'm still confused. The delta from the midline to a yellow step is one ADR. The delta from an upper yellow step to a lower yellow step is two ADR. The horizontal, dotted blue lines you drew are two ADR. I may have introduced some confusion myself. We keep talking about ADR vs ATR and have forgotten about the TMA. Really what we should be talking about are the upper and lower bands' offsets from the TMA's midline. In the BD strategy the offset from the midline is one ADR. If you wanted to use ATR instead then you also need the ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period -- exactly like in @George's methodology. The fact he kept those "secret" is because those settings are important and are even dependent on time frame and pair. Do you remember the profanity when I shared the M1 TMA settings that someone in their inner circle had shared with me? The TMA settings are crucial here. Using ADR as the offset is simple, it works and it even makes sense -- because ADR is the only metric (as far as I know) that we know in advance. And that's the edge -- the price almost always stays within the bounds of the yellow steps. And there is even a physical basis -- everyone who works at the bank goes home in the evening. We don't have to invoke some evil Swiss banker in an underground cave pulling levers to make the price go up and down. Look at the charts -- the price almost always stays within the bounds of the yellow steps. And only when it pokes its nose above or below then we open a trade in the opposite direction. What more do you want? If you were to teach someone this method how long would it take you to explain? BUY at the blue dot, SELL at the purple dot. Even I can do that...

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Shouldn't the offset from midline be half ADR for upper and lower bands to make it comparable to the original ADR high low level indicator ? As in, the top to bottom band delta is one ADR which gives BD ADR it's unique quality. One ADR offset based on the logic of the original ADR high/low level indicator is way too much. That's why the D1 100% setting on GU post#384 looks crappy that price will almost never penetrate because of this double sized offset. This oversized offset led to the many out of the hat fractional % settings - 100% setting is unusable. The W1 ADR is a seperate kettle of fish.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Isnt that 50% ADR offset from the daily TMA midline? That’s equal to 100% from top to bottom. I decided to use 40% offset from midline. To allow price to poke above the line and allow room for the CC pattern formation to complete outside the band to give a signal. Also 50% offset provide very few signals especially if you apply the daily settings to H4 T.F. Though for conservative traders, that’s fine.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Correct. If BD ADR is set up this way, 50% ADR offset from TMA midline, then traders can use the percentage setting as a fraction of the ADR according to their usage preference. That's what I want to draw r4m attention to with my posts today.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
@skyway -- where is it carved in stone the BD strategy has to be comparable to the original ADR high low level indicator? If you think the ADR has to be centered around the midline then, yes, half ADR offset would make sense. But the ADR doesn't necessarily have to be centered on the midline -- in fact, most of the time it isn't. You have the charts and indicators in front of you -- you can see the ADR travels above, below and around the midline. That's why one ADR offset makes sense. @skyway -- really? Have you been keeping score? Where else have you seen so many people have immediate success with a strategy? And you say it is unusable? Is pot now legal in the UK?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Bishopdotun has just posted in post#393 that says, I decided to use 40% offset from midline. To allow price to poke above the line and allow room for the CC pattern formation to complete outside the band to give a signal. Also 50% offset provide very few signals especially if you apply the daily settings to H4 T.F. Though for conservative traders, that’s fine. What then does 100% setting give ? I have posted my views. You may disagree.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
@skyway -- The "official" rules -- BD Time Frame: 10080 (i.e. the time frame for the uninterpolated TMA), and Percent ADR: 100%. There are other variations that can work -- in fact, an infinite number of combinations. And that's because the overarching concept behind the strategy is both simple and robust -- "wait for the ADR cup to fill, and then trade away". The "official" strategy works very well. "Unofficial" versions also work well. If you want to use 3%, 16%, xx% that's fine. I unlocked the settings because I understood people like to do things differently to make it theirs. Consider the "official" rules as the reference system . Just because "unofficial" versions work doesn't make the reference system wrong. EDIT: True. And in your views you seem to have completely blanked on the results that people have been reporting. Don't those count for anything?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I have no problems with the current one ADR offset from midline, I just make the necessary offset adjustment. My posts today is not about the results people have reported. And I won't make any more comments about % settings.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
surely, if you narrower the bands you will get more signals but the hit rate will be crappy???

--- 帖子 #400 ---
@skyway -- okay, let's let it lie. You did say "100% setting is unusable" -- a comment which would seem to negate everyone's results up until now. And that's what raised a red flag for me and why I pursued it.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Okay -- I'd like to get another word in about ATR versus ADR band offsets... There are many, many TMA-based strategies. Their upper and lower bands are based on ATR and require 3 settings -- ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and Period. These strategies are very flexible in that you can configure upper and lower bands to your heart's content. Furthermore, if you like testing for optimal values for different pairs and time frames then this alone will keep you occupied for many weeks and months. In fact, @George recommends several thousand hours, at least. The BD strategy uses a special-case of the ATR -- ADR. Not 16% ADR, not 33% ADR rather, just ADR. That's all that separates the BD strategy from all the others -- it uses a special-case of the ATR called ADR. If you don't like ADR then there is absolutely no reason to pursue the BD strategy. Using ADR as the band offset is the magic sauce . If you don't find value in the ADR then look into one of the many other TMA-based strategies. The reason why I resist moving away from ADR is because I'm not inclined to discard the magic sauce. EDIT: One other thing. The reason why 16% ADR works is not because of anything special about the BD strategy. Rather, it's because it is TMA-based and any TMA-based strategy with an upper and lower band can be configured to detect extreme prices that you trade away from.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Brilliant strategy by bishopdotun and equally brilliant coding by robots4me. Keep up the good work! Thought I'd point-out an abnormality I spotted a few days ago on GBPJPY. With buy trades triggered, the market closed then gapped-up to the market-open, skipping right over the mid-line. Accordingly, no exit was placed even though price had risen above the level where the trades should have been closed. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You guys are so far over my head I just have to chuckle!! I am from the old school and as the saying goes " If it ain't broke- don't fix it"!!!!

I totally disagree!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
One last word to explain why I made that comment and I stand by it. You earlier declared that D1 100% is your BD ADR trading strategy. You wrote at length to explain your view, this is an excerpt. Do trade D1 100% setting. Stay true to your BD strategy. I welcome everyone to commit this coming entire week to do the same. No other fractional setting is allowed to be posted on this thread and r4m other thread, enforce that(permanently).

--- 帖子 #406 ---
For those who trade consecutive candles, your trading is a variant of Consecutive Candles strategy with R4M-BD-ADR indicator fractional setting applied as filter where and when to trade CC. The original strategy applies it's own filter. Read these threads. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=908563 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=914079

@skyway -- you take it too literally to make me wrong. Here is what I said -- and I quote: "Wait for the ADR cup to become 100% full, and then trade away" How many strategies do you know of that can be described in one sentence -- 13 words or less. Probably not too many. I think I wrote that in the context of my discussion with @Robot Trader to emphasize (a) the importance of ADR, and (b) how conceptually simple it is. I think I also followed that quote mentioning something about there being additional details, of course. Let's see -- there are over 400 posts in this thread, and 5000 posts on the other. Many of them mine. I probably have a few hundred thousands words invested here. And you take a generic post and cherry pick "D1 100% ADR" to create a new quote and attribute it to me? So, now I'm not clear what your intention is. Are you suggesting that people trade exactly that in the hope it won't go well and then that proves you right and me wrong? I mean, what is your intent? To convince people I'm wrong? Below is a back test I posted July 8 (post #4561). Are you really prepared to claim D1 100% ADR is unusable? You've never even bothered to actually test the strategy or EA -- you just trade manually. Yet you make these claims. I have evidence and proof that it works. You are a stickler for evidence. When others make claims you demand evidence. You've now made a claim that "100% ADR is unusable" -- where is your evidence? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I have zero intention to make you wrong. I have zero intention to win this argument. It is not an argument to me. By unusable, I mean that members more likely post fractional settings rather that 100% setting. Post#405 &amp; 406 explains, I have no further comment.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
@skyway -- dude, you're doing it again. I never said that. I said the original strategy is based on ADR and not pieces of it or ATR. At your (and other's) request I unlocked the %ADR so people could experiment. Using fractions of ADR the strategy can also work at LTF -- but every TMA-based strategy can be fiddled with to work at LTF. That setting only affects the offset from the TMA midline -- BFD. If it is so important to you to make your own offsets then use something else. There are countless TMA-based strategies and indicators available that you can use to adjust offsets to whatever you like. Why are you so intent on inflicting your preferences on me? If the BD strategy is useless and doesn't suit you then why do you persist? Are you now going to turn into the next @moodybot or @bluesteele and trash me some more? Are you hoping to save all the newbies from becoming one of my herd and being scammed? Why not start your own thread and discuss your trading strategies there? The BD strategy is unique in its use of ADR. If you don't want to use ADR that's fine -- use whatever you like. @skyway -- I know it bugs you that I claim I'm a "rookie" and it doesn't sit well that a rookie might have a strategy that (a) not only works better than anything you've ever come up with, (b) has shared it with others who are also having success. If it makes you feel any better -- I'm not any ordinary rookie. And I'll leave it at that... EDIT: @skyway -- I wrote the above before your last post. I don't want to delete it because I spent 10 minutes writing it. It's fine with me for you to have the last word and respond to this post, but then I would request that we let this go.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi, I was referred onto this thread and find it interesting. And wrt to the discussion on ADR vs ATR, as you may likely be aware, in MQL code, ADR can be derived using a built-in iATR function: ADR = iATR(Symbol, PERIOD_D1 , adrPeriod, shift)*pipMult; // for ADR in pips In iATR the averaging function is done internally, I believe it might be an EMA, but for period=20 there isn't much difference whether it was EMA, SMA, LWMA... The benefit is that no TMA parameters are required and MA is not needed to be calculated (of which both MA and ADR can be resource hogs if not careful). So something like the following code could be used for the "Range" calculation: extern ENUM_TIMEFRAMES timeframe = PERIOD_D1; extern int period = 20; extern double percentScaler = 100; extern MaxBars = 1000; double scaler, adr[]; in the Init() or OnInit() fcn: double pipMult = 1/_Point/10; scaler = pipMult*percentScaler/100; And in the Start() or OnCalculate() fcn: int limit = IndicatorCounted(); limit = ((limit == 0) &amp;&amp; (MaxBars &gt; 0)) ? MathMin(MaxBars, Bars-1) : (limit == 0) ? Bars-1 : Bars-limit; for (int i = limit; i &gt;= 0; i--) { datetime bTime = iTime(NULL, 0, i); int bShift = iBarShift(_Symbol, 0, bTime); adr[i] = iATR(_Symbol, timeframe, period, bShift)*scaler; } Then you would have a generic calculation that would handle either ADR or ATR for any timeframe, period or percentScaler required, with defaults as per BD strategy. Hopefully you will find this useful. Al

--- 帖子 #411 ---
@albry -- thanks very much. I'll look into using your code. As far as parameters -- for all the TMA algorithms I've seen one does need to define upper and lower bands as offsets from the midline. The settings ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and ATRPeriod are used to create the upper and lower bands. So, yes, your code calculates ATR. But what we really need are offsets from the TMA midline. The BD strategy uses one ADR as the offset. It looks like your implementation may also require parameters -- e.g. percent Scaler. Also, there is a loop calling two functions with a 'shift' argument. Compare that with using: ADR = iATR(Symbol, PERIOD_D1 , 20, 1); If I don't fully grasp or appreciate the implementation above -- I apologize. I'm requesting that we move on from ADR vs ATR.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi robot4me, Yes, a TMA is also needed for ATR if that is what you use for ADR center line, but I would think that one of the iIMA methods like EMA or LWMA might be good enough and likely more efficient (particularly for long MA periods). The ATRMultiplier would be exactly the same percentADR you are using now and the "Range" be it ATR or ADR would be added/subtracted from the center line. No difference. The shift argument is likely what you have done with your "BD timeframe" parameter to get the monthly/weekly/daily/H4 etc transitions, but done automatically by these routines, no extra code other than these 2 lines. However if you are actually using ADR with fixed shift=1, then I would think that any historical data with this being used, from a strategy test point of view might be a problem when MaxBars goes over a HTF bar change. And it also points to an optimization that could be done in code above if bShift = iBarShift(_Symbol, timeframe, bTime) hasn't changed then last iATR value calculated can be reused. Anyways, it is your forum and your code, but I thought I would pointed out that I believe the internal calculation might be identical if implemented this way; that some interesting results might result from the flexibility; and might also increase the performance (since built-in function calls vs custom TMA and particularly if iCustom or long TMA periods are used). So this is the last I will mention on ATR unless asked otherwise. Good luck and moving on, Al

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Albry, Thank you for your two posts, I thought there must be a way of using data from the lower time frames rather than just using a percentage of the ADR, to try and simulate it (which for me never made sense), so hopefully it can be implemented, because R4M did offer to do so providing I could demonstrate to him how it could be done without the need for other user defined parameter that require secret settings. With my M30 BT (posted earlier) using Tick data it took MT4 Strategy Tester over 2 days to do a 18 months test, I have never had to wait that long before with any other EA that I have tested, so also just maybe your code suggestions might be less CPU intensive which regardless of ADR v ATR would be a good thing moving forward. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #414 ---
@Robot Trader -- it would be more CPU intensive because it executes in a loop calling two functions. The current implementation is a single function call to a built-in API. Also, as @albry acknowledged and I've repeated multiple times now, it's not just the calculation of ATR. It's calculating the offsets of the upper and lower TMA bands. So, @albry's code doesn't solve the problem of the missing settings -- ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and ATRPeriod. If ADR doesn't suit you then why bother with the BD strategy? There are many other indicators and EAs that are TMA-based and offer the flexibility to use ATR with whatever settings you wish. Again -- the BD strategy's magic sauce is using ADR -- and let me be clear -- when I say ADR I don't mean 16% ADR. I mean 100% ADR. This is what sets it apart from other TMA-based indicators and EAs. If you don't wish to use ADR then the BD strategy is not for you, or @skyway or anyone else who is not interested in using ADR. EDIT: Again, I am requesting that we drop this issue -- no ATR.

Hi R4M, I have followed the thread from the beginning, where you wanted to trade reversals and that had nothing to do with D1 reversals. at that time we were even looking at trading them on the M1. You now think that you have the D1 in the bag and that you have achieved your goal, I remain skeptical, however I will continue to do my due diligence on the D1 and see what results it produces. Unlike the LTF's the D1 gives very few signals and therefore in this very short period of time since you have released the EA/Strategy it is far too soon to draw any meaningful conclusions, so lets see where we are in 6 to 12 months time. For me it is sad to see that you have given up on the LTF's, George said you wouldn't be able to do it and I said if I can't do it then you never will, so for me the story ends with you pushing me away because its the BD Strategy on the Daily or the Highway. You also forget that you asked me to be the OP for a thread dedicated to the LTF, why would you even bother doing that when your intentions were never to follow the greedy traders wishes. No doubt you will have some fancy worded reply, but for me you need to remember where this thread started and why members have followed you. Regards RT

@Robot Trader -- part of what you say is true. I guess what happened is things changed and I changed with them. I'll do that sometimes. I'm not wedded to a particular approach -- but when I see something that works then I want to go for it. I know you remain skeptical -- and that's because you haven't been trading the BD strategy like others have. You won't even demo test it until you've done tick back testing. I've tried to dissuade you to move away from tick back testing -- even temporarily -- but you won't give it up. I sound like a broken record. I haven't given up on LTFs -- it's just that you don't need the BD strategy to trade LTFs. There are numerous other TMA-based strategies to trade LTFs. I feel like you want me to switch to using ATR because you know I'll do everything for free. ATR doesn't suit me -- that's clear, right? If you read @bishopdotun's recommendations you'll see that W1 / 100% ADR / M15 or M30 or H1 or H4 work well. He uses W1 / 100% to get Entries, and then the LTF charts for accuracy. From the beginning, it was clear the BD strategy was not about quantity -- it was always about quality. The quantity issue is addressed by trading 28 pairs. @Robot Trader -- I don't want to push you away. I just want you to get with the program and give it try without feeling compelled you have to change it to make it your own. Regarding Daily -- you take me too literally. That was the original rule and that is the reference system. You can use lower time frame charts to get more accurate entries, but W1 / 100% ADR works best. You've seen others post very nice results -- yet, you can't seem to bring yourself to follow @bishopdotun's recommendations. That baffles me. I haven't forgotten. I have a memory like an elephant. And I never forget a friend or when someone does me a favor. Keep in mind we've always been flying by the seat of our pants. Nothing was planned. Things kept changing -- look at the title of the thread. When the BD strategy started we locked it on W1 TMA / 100% ADR / Daily chart. And then people clamored for more flexibility so I reluctantly exposed the Percent ADR setting. I figured there was the risk I'd be opening a can of worms, but I didn't want to micromanage how people use their software tools. And then, lo and behold, people were getting good results. So then we started thinking there was a future for LTF and this thread was then started. But then I realized the reason why LTF appears to work is not because of anything special this strategy does but, rather, it's just another TMA-based strategy where extreme prices poke above some band. Since I had exposed the Percent ADR setting then you were able to adjust the offsets. And as you've pointed out, if we are going to allow 16% ADR then why not instead use ATR -- and I agree. And then I think it was a mistake to expose the Percent ADR setting. And as you kept pushing ATR then it because more clear why I don't want to go that route. For one -- the BD strategy would no longer be unique. And I don't want to be used as everyone's free programmer to develop yet another generic TMA indicator and EA. You can use other indicators and EAs that use ATR. And, secondly, it became clear that ADR was the magic sauce. And if some people don't appreciate it then what am I supposed to do? Abandon what I see as something special just so that I can develop custom software for you? @Robot Trader, we are both strong willed and disagreements come with the territory. It doesn't change anything that you've done for me. And how you've helped to move things forward. Back in April who would've thought we'd be having this conversation? We both have our boundaries and mine -- at least for the moment -- is to stick with ADR. I have no objection if people want to use Percent ADR to trade lower time frames -- it's just that I don't want to spend the time implementing yet another variation. And, we both know, it would never end there, right? People can't help asking for more, or can you do this, or how about using that instead. It just never ends. I want it to end. I want to reach the point where this strategy is completed and I can enjoy trading it. I will still support the software and answer questions, but I don't want to keep coding everyone's ideas. Sorry if this is a "fancy worded" reply. My nature is to be verbose. Plus, I've written so many scientific publications I can do this in my sleep. I hope you'll hang around. And if not, I understand. But let's not burn any bridges. I still have some tread left on the old tires so I plan to be here awhile. And we'll cross paths again, for sure. FF isn't that big. Thanks dude...

Hi Skyway, Can you please share what indicator you have used in your second screenshot, rather than reply on this thread which it dedicated to RBA System and custom indicators, would you please respond on my Trash Traders thread you will find it in my profile. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi R4M, Please let me say, I am not looking for free coding, just PM me your details and I will pay your fee, this is not about money for me, I don't see the value in using an ADR percentage on the LTF's full stop. If this can only be done through adding additional parameters to make the ATR work then so be it, does this really matter, I like finding setting and so do many others and yes I would share those setting, should they work. And before you ask the answer is yes we are still friends Regards RT

--- 帖子 #419 ---
@Robot Trader -- thank you. And about coding fees -- I would never charge you. Let's let the dust settle here. And I want a little bit of time to actually spend trading -- which I've done very little of recently. And then we can circle back and see if there is anything interesting to create. That will also give you time to get clear exactly what it is you are looking for in a LTF strategy.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
@RT &amp; @R4M ok..ok.. It's ADR or ATR. Now we have reached a milestone with ADR. Next @RT would clearly lead the @ATR conversation. He believes strongly in the value of ATR over LTF. Which is great. I do strongly feel we might find something special down the road. Outside Forex, I have been involved in a couple of development projects where we find something great that's entirely different from initial project objectives. Think penicillin and microwave oven. So all is well. I support both sides of the divide....but I have preference for ADR until I see a clear evidence that ATR works better. I have tried NIH's TMA indicator to simulate ATR from different TF and I just couldn't come up with anything better than ADR. May be I didn't look well enough. So I invite @RT &amp; @Skyway to lead this alternative approach. This is the only way we can put an end to this back and forth. We can then collaborate further. What next? @RT or Skyway: Could you provide a short and simple step by step guide of how the indicator would work and show signals. From my understanding of @R4M, he likes to have things in a simple to-do checklist.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
My selling method has found a way to reverse the trend of tma, not the way people are now working on development and debate. So I'd like to thank the R4M for making this. If I could share this with you, it would be amazing. I'm thinking about sharing this right now.

I'd like this method... to be used widely used. I know more ways, but get inspiration from yourself. I'm going to do more experiments. I am sure that this is surprising. I think a lot of people are going to experiment with this article.

This shows the entry and exit sections. Values are judged to be substantial. I've been working on this for a while. It's kind of complicated. Keep in mind that the circle on the border gives direction. This is the first step, so it's going to evolve over time.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi guys, It’s incredible the amount confusion and misunderstandings between @robots4me, @RobotTrader and @skyway regarding ADR vs ATR. @robots4me: You keep relating ATR with TMA, when the others were only talking about using ATR instead of ADR, apart from the TMA centered midline. The default ATR indicator only uses one input parameter: time period (according to the current time-frame). So RobotTrader simply wanted to use standard ATR or " A * variable-period/time-frame(H4;H1;M30;M15;M5;M1) * R " instead of %ADR. And the 16%ADR 20 (period) just equals to H4/H24(D1); but using H4 ATR (or " A * H4 * R ") 120 (24/4*20) would adjust faster to H4 candles volatility. In fact, the only difference between D1 ATR 20 and ADR, is that ATR includes gaps but ADR doesn’t: https://www.niftyscalper.com/blogs/2...-dont-tell-you http://www.daytradingbias.com/averag...one-is-better/

--- 帖子 #429 ---
IMHO, you’re overcomplicating things, and wasting your time with shorter time-frames. Traders are addicted to constantly getting pips, day-in day-out; but this only works well with narrow ranging markets. Although price charts across scales are somewhat “fractal”, return to the mean strategies work much better within more open bigger/longer-term scales. And there should be balance between scale and trade frequency, so D1 is the best all-round “mean” for that. Smaller time-frames generate more trades but with less positive consistency; and bigger, well, it becomes way too big with very little trades. Also, proportionally, the bigger the time-frame, the smaller the impact of "black-swans". Price is just a number (exchange rate with spread) that goes up and down (not stating the “why”, but simply what it does), and after all, its “movement” could be represented/visualized even with a single perpetual candlestick or axis ⇅ ⇄ without time. As VEE often stated, there must be universal neutrality/equilibrium between all main global currencies (not pairs) so they can "move" and properly work. The best way to capture most of the fluctuations, is using a general 28 pair basket; much better than trading multiple time-frames per pair with less overall pairs, as this would also cause bigger overall exposure to those currencies. It’s like the Swiss watch of wealth transfer: when value increases for one currency, it also has to proportionally decrease for other(s). --- For the R4M-BD-ADR strategy, I'd like these settings: Trade trigger = Market order 2 hours before D1 candle closes , if price is fluctuating outside the channel. TP/SL = X*ADR Money management = Divide the total lot size of a "trade cycle" between X possible positions (for example 3, so 0.3 lots instead of 1). After the first one, fire the next order if price inside the following bar reaches X*ADR farther away from the previous open position, also 22 hours into it. And close all positions with a new average TP/SL between them. After the first position of a cycle, the bands are no longer needed, until the next one. Repeat only after all the positions of a "trade cycle" have already closed. * Oh, and for smaller time-frames, I would also use ATR/ A * period * R instead of %ADR. EDIT: The new " MinPercentAdrCup " filter could work as the time-factor for my "trade trigger" suggestion. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
@Viktory -- yes, you are correct. And in more recent posts I took responsibility for that confusion. To be clear, it was always about the TMA bands. They wanted to use ATR and I want to stick with ADR (a special case of ATR). And when I say ADR I don't mean a percentage, I mean ADR. We do not use "pure" ATR. Most all TMA-based indicators use ATR to define the upper and lower bands. In the BD strategy we use ADR. The ADR is the ADR -- there is no fractional ADR. However, because I exposed the setting 'Percent ADR' which is used to define the bands then people found they could use it for LTF charts -- which is fine. And then people got caught up with LTF and said "Well, why not use ATR instead of Percent ADR"? And I said fine, go ahead, but you don't need the BD strategy if you want the flexibility of using ATR to define your bands. When you use ATR to define your bands then you also need the settings ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and ATRPeriod. But @Robot Trader couldn't supply those -- he wanted that to be user configurable. And then we would be back at the beginning. @Viktory -- I thought we were over this. Like @Robot Trader and @skyway you are confusing the calculation with the meanings. ADR is a special case of ATR. It can be computed using the same formula. But if it is to be used to create bands then you also have to supply ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and ATRPeriod -- which @Robot Trader recently discovered on his thread as he works on an LTF version. I'm done experimenting. I don't want to make people figure out on their own the best settings. Furthermore, ADR has a very important meaning and implication. If I tell you the ADR is 44 pips and you look at a price chart that gives you a lot of insight into whether or not now is a good time to make a reversal trade. But if I tell you the ATR is currently 0.002364 then what are you supposed to do with that? So -- it's ADR. You can use that 'Percent ADR' setting I exposed if you want to use the current indicator for LTF trading. I agree that for LTF trading then ATR (along with the proper settings, whatever they may be) gives you more flexibility -- but how much better would be the results? You guys don't know. You believe "flexibility" translates to better results. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. I'm not interested in doing custom programming to satisfy hunches. Also, I'm not interested in delving into LTF. To the extent the BD strategy can be used for LTF trading then fine. But I'm not pursuing LTF trading any further than that. EDIT: @Viktory -- it's not about the calculation. It's about the meaning. ADR has a very important meaning. You can predict it in advance. It holds its value over days and weeks. You can't say that about ATR -- think about. Let me put it this way -- if you gave me the ADR for EURUSD I could almost use that alone to trade. But if you gave me the current ATR for EURUSD-M15 that would be useless to me by this time tomorrow. And, again, if you were to replace ADR with ATR to compute the bands then you also need to decide on what values to use for ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and ATRPeriod. Plus, you have to be sure those values would give the correct ADR bands regardless of pair and time frame. And, in fact, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't. In MT4 the ADR is calculated using the equation iATR (Symbol(), PERIOD_D1, NumberOfDaysToAverage /*ATRPeriod*/, 1); Using ATR on lower time frames I think would give a different result -- close, but not the same.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
@robots4me: About ADR vs ATR, we'll have to agree to disagree. ADR is just D1 ATR with a slightly different time period calculation; " ADR is the average of intraday (High-Low) value, and ATR is a range which includes Gaps as it calculates from previous Day-Close ". And in lower time-frames ATR*X is like " A ( variable-period/time-frame{H4;H1;M30;M15;M5;M1}) R *X". I mean we could use ATR only to calculate the pip-distance from the centered TMA mid-line to the upper/lower bands; so it's not to "compute the bands". In lower than D1 time-frames, ATR is simply more sensible and adapts better to recent bars price-action. And regarding the rest (using D1), of course I agree, as I previously stated:

--- 帖子 #432 ---
@Viktory -- Yes, I agree. When you say just then I think you are missing the point -- or maybe not, I'm not sure. ADR is not just some arbitrary ATR calculation. It is physical. You know it in advance -- which is not true of other ATR calculations. You can take it to the bank. The reason is because people who work at banks and financial institutions perform tasks during the day and then go home. There really is this concept of the day coming to an end and transactions being completed. And that is why the ADR is special. Furthermore -- back to TMA bands -- if you are going to use the "flexible" ATR calculation to compute band offsets then you also have to give me the ATRMultiplier, HalfLength and ATRPeriod that will simulate ADR for all pairs regardless of which chart the indicator is attached to. I've been 'round and 'round with @Robot Trader and @skyway with this and they still can't come up with those numbers. I mean, I could come up with those numbers -- but it would take time and experimenting and testing. If you can come up with those settings and guarantee they generate the same ADR bands for all pairs and time frames then I would consider using ATR to calculate offsets. But I still don't want to spend time with LTFs.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I chose not to involve myself with your requests that's directed at Robot Trader. This is why. And, I have adhered to your request to move on from this ADR vs ATR subject.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
@skyway -- I know, and thank you. I was just testing to see if you were awake.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Yes, I'm talking about ATR's more precise flexibility for lower time-frames. For D1, ADR is perfect as it already is

--- 帖子 #436 ---
@Viktory -- thanks. I don't mean to jump on you, and you do make valid points. It's just that you came late to the ADR-versus-ATR party and I felt I had already expended myself. If @Robot Trader and / or others can come up with a viable, working set of rules that they can demonstrate work well at LTFs then I would consider automating it. It's just that I don't want to do all the background and preparatory work and testing.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Respectfully, aren't you forgetting that the ADR is exactly that: an AVERAGE Daily Range. Therefore by following Robot Trader's line of thought from Post #260 ( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post12401796 ) all we would actually be doing is using one day LESS in the average calculation. i.e. if you do not include the current day's price action in the calculation of the ADR then it will effectively make a 20 period ADR into a 19 period ADR. This therefore is not wildly corrupting the data range, and therefore not wildly corrupting your ADR value. There are lines of thought which prescribe to intentionally NOT INCLUDING the current day price action in daily indicator calculations because the current day is viewed as not being completed and therefore not a valid data range to use. I share this opinion and humbly think that the EA and the indicator would be a lot better off for only considering completed days and ignoring the current day. An added advantage is that it would do away with recalcs/repaints because the indicator would only have to consider a fixed dataset in any of its calculations. I mean, realistically speaking, how much more accuracy is a fraction/part of the current days data, averaged into the preceding 19 periods going to have? Statistically speaking it will be anywhere between 0% and 5% depending on how far into the new day we have gone from market open. Any thoughts or feedback are welcomed thankyou

I agree ! Moreover as I am a stubborn guy, I suggest (as already written ) that you use a multiple of 8 Time Units for the period : 8,16, 32, 64, 128, 256 test and look at the results !

--- 帖子 #442 ---
@rogertaggart -- the indicator uses the equation below to calculate the ADR: iATR (Symbol(), PERIOD_D1, NumberOfDaysToAverage /*ATRPeriod*/, 1); The last parameter -- '1' -- is called the 'shift'. '0' shift means current bar, '1' means previous bar. So, the calculation does NOT include the current bar. Furthermore, since the current bar is not complete then it wouldn't make sense to include an incomplete D1 bar when computing the ADR. You can't be serious -- do you know how many pips 5% could be? If the price dropped 5% not only would it blow away your account, it would probably also take your broker with it.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
@parisboy -- for the period of what? The ADR? Do you mean to use 8,16, 32, 64, 128, 256 for the number of days used to average the daily range? If so, there is a setting for that. People can use any number of days for the ADR computation.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Many thanks for that clarification R4M. I apologise for any silly questions/observations. I am glad to see current day is not used in the calcs. When I mentioned 5% what i meant is that it could affect an ADR value by 5% e.g. if the ADR is 200pips for a pair, it could +/- affect it to 190-210 i.e. 10 pips (5%) either way. A 10pip lee-way is negligible if correct MM in place EDIT: Question: why do the ADR lines move/update in real time if the ADR calc does not take the current day into consideration?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
@rogertaggart -- my apologies. I read your post too quickly and jumped to the wrong conclusion. You are right -- 5% difference in the ADR would have no effect. The ADR metric is not inherently that accurate.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
......Pls read previous posts bro... Clearly you didn’t read the thread. You keep asking questions that have been answered several times. Imagine if everybody does that. The midline is centered TMA and is using current candle data depending on whether you are using Daily or weekly data. So the ADR bands offset remain fixed but the midline shifts till end of the period. This underlines why the new update Min %ADR is a classic addition. It helps to control entries even if price action have poked above the bands.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
@parisboy -- so, why didn't you ever tell me this before? Okay -- I will experiment with 8, 16, and 32. For our purposes I think 64, 128, 256 wouldn't be appropriate. Using MT4's Strategy Tester and optimizer, do you think that would be good enough to choose between 8. 16, 32 or do we have to forward test in a demo account? BTW -- I like the larger fonts. Previously I didn't understand. But with the larger fonts then the light bulb went on. Perhaps this is another lesson we learned from @George? Next time add more color and some extra commas... EDIT: Oh, yes, I almost forgot the most important ingredient -- the obligatory insults for anyone who questions his trading methodology.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
@parisboy -- I used MT4's optimizer and did a quick test that varied the number of days (period) used when computing the ADR. All other settings were held constant. The screen shot below shows the results sorted by 'Profit Factor'. Powers-of-2 don't necessarily rank that high. I wouldn't claim that powers-of-2 don't come into play at times, but it certainly isn't obvious here. By the way, what is the basis for the powers-of-2 theory. I'm too lazy to read your thread. Is there an explanation or is it more of an empirical observation? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
According to the optimized backtest result, # Days ADR=10 is the optimum value. @parisboy, sir, personally what is your preferred number for ADR if applied here in the RBA strategy?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
@benjun9 -- it's not that simple. Also, you should be able to do this youself. If I had allowed the optimizer to include other settings (e.g. FractionStopLoss, FractionTakeProfit) then '10' would no longer be the optimum. Also, the optimum varies from pair-to-pair and different time frames. That's why if you really, really want the best value you need to be able to use Strategy Tester yourself. And then there is always the trade-off -- over curve-fitting. You may find the best value for GBPNZD-M15 for this week, but then next week it's a different number. And you certainly don't want to fall into the trap of constantly recalibrating. So what's the solution? There is no good one. We compromise and choose a value that seems to work well enough for most pairs and time frames.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I just get the average of the # days adr with the profit factor of 4 (according to optimized bt) and the result is ...20! So 20 for adr is a good choice as it is the default for the rba indi/ea and seems to work well.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Benjun9 I do not use ADR and TmaBands and MT4 ! So my interest in Robots4me thread is because "Band Reversal Strategy " is the same whatever platform and bands you use. AS I have N times written you can only used Edge Band Trading or Mid Band Trading as described by Jim Hurst in 1970 As Bands I used a Triad of 3 Envelopes based on Centered Moving Averages 256, 128 and 32 Time Units To calculate the fixed width of these bands I use the Gann Octave , roughly the division by 8 of the Price Range. According to Gann there is a relationship between Price and Time which creates a specific vibration and the financial support is very sensitive towards this vibration. I can not write more here because I do not want to hijack Bishopdotun thread. All this is largely documented in my Thread or in my posts published on Robots4me thread who is too lazy to read them.

Is anyone else experiencing their Mt4 running extremely slow to the point of freezing with the R4M indis? I installed a new version of mt4 from my broker twice now and added just the R4m indis and EAs with 5 charts open. Both installs are at times unusably slow. One big advantage of the all pairs EA just one chart.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
It's quite slow for me as well, but I'm running it on 11 charts.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
You need just 2 charts. 1. Dashboard for signals on all multiple pairs 2. Symbol chart with symbol changer for analysis before executing the signal

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Of course! I feel so stupid now. Carry on.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Aha that would be the sensible thing to do yes! I will do that now. Many thanks @bishopdotun

--- 帖子 #469 ---
@Simontw -- the Dashboard and AllPairs EA run slow for me, as well. It's because with each tick (or timer) they loop through all pairs and compute for each one. If you are trading 28 pairs then its the equivalent to having 28 charts open. Try opening 28 charts on MT4... In the next release -- later today -- I've changed the way the EAs loop through all the pairs. Instead of doing all 28 at once it does 2 at a time. It takes around 30 seconds to touch all pairs. Doing it this way the EAs seem less likely to bog down MT4.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Me too!

@spae11 -- do you see the message in the middle of the chart? "WARNING: Please don't change the indicator's name."

Yeah, I get a warning message, but there's nothing wrong with it. It's working fine.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
@spae11 -- How do you know? Are you sure? There's a reason for the warning message. Also, if you rename the indicator it won't work with the EAs.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I'm not saying that. There was no inconvenience in my line of use . I don't use EA . It is used manually for ADR trading purposes .

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Man, here the point is: why did you change its name, in the first place?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi fwiw just pointing out that I assume, quite rightly, RB4ME, you put in place some code to protect the identity of the software and this flags if someone is trying to take advantage. However I also had this message appear on my chart when reviewing it and it appeared after I had added another indicator(s) to my chart to compare my existing method signal trigger entry points with entry points of the BD system. There was no malice or intent to deceive/misuse and the message remained after I deleted the comparison indi(s). Based on Spae11 response, I am guessing similar thing may have happened to him/her?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
@Paulnz57 -- the naming serves two purposes -- the first, as you point out, is to offer some protection from someone renaming it and then claiming it as their own. The second, and more important, is the EAs use the indicator for their signals. If you rename the indicator then the EAs can't find it and won't work. Whether or not the warning message appears shouldn't be affected by other indicators. However, if the warning message appears and you later remove the indicator then the warning may still remain -- but that's because the indicator didn't fully cleanup after itself when it exited.

The reason why I modified my name is because I overwrite it in a folder, and it is modified to (1) later.And can I use two new and old versions together after that?I was curious, so I tried it, and it turned out to be an error.I'm sorry for any misunderstanding because I didn't use it for anything malicious.

Two things on the dashboard. First a question with Auto Exit Enabled and a TP/SL set. Does this mean that EA will auto exit at the designated percentage of ADR for the TP or at chosen exit method like crossing midline.....whichever comes first? Also momentum filter setting showing on screen but not in the settings. Safety disclaimer: Yes I have read the thread

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hello @Simontw... Yes... Okay -- a bit more details. TP (and SL) is registered with your broker at the time an order is placed. It always takes precedence. If the TP is reached then the broker closes the order -- regardless of the ADR, Exit condition, etc. As long as the SL and TP have not been hit then the algorithm continues to execute until an Exit condition has been met. I'm glad you are taking a look at the AutoExit feature. I coded it and I think/hope it should work, but since it can't be tested in Strategy Tester and since I'm not about to sit around waiting for Exit conditions, then I can't say it has been well tested. Good question... There was a time when a Momentum filter was included as an optional setting. But we found Consecutive Candles worked better so it was removed. I decided to leave that Momentum column in the dashboard EA because I think Momentum is still interesting, but it is not used for detecting signals. ... EDIT: @Simontw -- I'm not referring to you... Before anyone asks -- the answer is 'no' -- the Momentum filter will not be re-added to the BD algorithm.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Thank you for clarifying. I have turned auto exit on so will see if it triggers.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
@spae11 -- I know and I trust you.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi R4M, Question, why can't the Auto Exit be tested in Strategy Tester, I have a number of EA's that close trades before the Broker fixed SL is reached, based on Exit parameters, which work OK in Strategy Tester? Regards RT

--- 帖子 #485 ---
The Autoexit here is the one on multipair dashboard for manual trading.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
@Robot Trader -- because it is a dashboard EA with many pairs. You manually open a trade by pressing a button. The idea behind the AutoExit is to partially automate trading -- that is, you manually open a trade and then walk away. When enabled, the AutoExit code is nearly identical to the Exit code for the single and AllPair trading EAs.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi R4M, I see, so sorry to ask, but does the AutoExit, close each pair individually should they have a basket of trades in profit or does the AutoExit look at how all the 28 pairs are performing and when they have reached say 5% profit collectively across all 28 pairs then the EA closes them all out and starts again. I just wondered if the EA took the 28 pairs or how many pairs are open (even though you manually set the process going) as one big trade within the account and therefore was not interested if some were losing money providing the 28 pairs offset each others losses and added to the account at all times, when the AutoExit kicked in. Regards RT

--- 帖子 #488 ---
@Robot Trader -- it's not that complicated. It's the same logic as the single and AllPairs trading EAs. Each pair is treated individually. If you have 5 open GBPJPY trades and an Exit signal is generated, then all GBPJPY positions are closed. And when you think about the (simple) underlying logic and the Entry and Exit conditions, then I believe that is the right thing to do. That is -- trades may be scaled in, but when an Exit signal occurs then it is time to close them all.

Are these automated exits? What are you tp conditions?

--- 帖子 #491 ---
At least try to read the first page..... and a few pages of the thread. The answer would be starring you in the eye.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
@chinchin50 -- since he is using the indicator by itself then I assume he is trading manually. In which case there would be no automated exits and the SL/TP conditions are up to you. The default SL/TP for the EAs are fractions of the ADR. If you are manually trading then you would need to calculate these yourself.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
On MM and Minimum distance.... There is no need to develop another EA. Over at SHF, there are 2 EAs; TDESk and Desky(TDESk Trading drone). Everything you are asking for is already there. The only thing that’s missing is RTs lot calculation method. Desky has a setting to calculate lot per balance or per equity. @R4M just needs to make the BD Dashboard compatible with TDESk and you can fly. If anyone needs something complex, that’s where to go. It’s all there in TDESK. I don’t know about FF rules but a simple google search will take you there. I won’t share links.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
@bishopdotun -- I'm not asking for anything close to develop a brand new EA, but just implementing two more useful simple features (simple but super effective); easier than making the BD Dashboard compatible with TDESk, and without the hassle of connecting it to other tools as you suggest, for every current and future users. Trade lot-size calculation according to the " %ADR SL " setting already in use, and placing the desired percentage SL risk per trade based on equity/balance . Setting a " MinDistanceBetweenOrders " (farther-away = higher for sells &amp; lower for buys) for every pair: if a trade is already open, don't trigger the following if the entry signal isn't at least at the same price level of the previous, or farther-away by " X%ADR " (being a dynamic variable depending on the ever-changing ADR, as the " SL/TP fraction of ADR " setting)... It simply allows to have fewer higher quality entries for continuous trades on the same pair , hence also contributing to better risk/exposure-management in order to not over-trade . EDIT: Chart screenshot attached: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Please think about it...

Have you tried to use CC filter on H1 &amp; H4? You will get fewer entries and the feature you are asking for would become redundant. You call it 2 simple features. R4M will decide that. We all have simple features here and there to ask for. If he goes about implementing simple features, at some point the options become too many and difficult to understand. Add newbies coming in to ask basic questions about every feature repeatedly. I am not against your suggestion neither am I in support. I doubt if the difference to the result will be significant. R4M and RT test results says no. In fact on H4 (using CC signal) you hardly get 2 signals per cycle. Test for yourself. On D1, with original recipe, why not break down your lots to microlots and catch as many signals as possible. So..... I suggest that before R4M adds another feature, let us hunt down all the bugs in the current version. After that, we can deal this additional feature and many more that may be considered useful. In fact that's one of the objectives of this thread. To debate new features.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thank you very much for your kind replay ^^ I'll search and read about CC, as I'm probably missing something, from the times I was absent from the forum =S And I agree with: " catching as many signals as possible ", but only if they are farther-away (higher sells and lower buys) enough from the previous ones... That's why I think of "Max%ADR-DistanceBetweenTrades" as a very good simple complement that doesn't hurt to also have as a plus, being nothing "fancy" or extra complicated even for noobs.

Yes, I agree with you that H4 seems to be the most suitable for you BD strategy! I shared 1 result I was waiting for, watching, placing orders yesterday since the signal appeared until the end. ADR Bands change as price rises. Therefore, if you don't track historical data, it often proves to be correct, but in reality how to enter the order properly, it needs many factors: waiting for signals, strong psychology, Trading on H4 (1440, H4) and other signals, I believe the transaction will be effective and profitable. I analyze the lack of any signals that I would like for your comments to improve your excellent strategy for XAU_USD. I love practicing XAU_USD market trading because it is stable, increasing and decreasing according to the rules and according to the strategic principles you have set. I think the trading efficiency will be higher. However, the disadvantage is that in a week, the day will be less signal than other transactions Sincere thanks!

Before going to a short holiday I just want to publish my results on a demo forward test from last week with "old" AllPairsEA D1 on M15 and Microlots. The only manual intervention was switching back to MidLine cross closing at mid-week since OppositeBand closing did not work at the beginning of the week. I know it was a special week but nevertheless 1875 pips on live data is an awesome result ! DD was very low, max. margin in use was below 200€.

New Update and Release Thanks to R4M's brilliance and hard work, we now have a new and much improved indicator to trade with. Download here Read the full updates here The Centered TMA for BDX differs in three ways compared to the one used for BD: (1) It does not repaint. (2) It is "curvilinear", rather than horizontal (un-interpolated) (3) It uses the same time frame as the chart to which it is attached. Entries: We use Heiken Ashi transitions. If a Heiken Ashi transition occurs above / below an ADR band then that is marked as a candidate Entry signal. Exits: Exit signal are marked when the price crosses the midline OR there is a HMA transition -- whichever comes first. Midline crossings are much more common, though HMA transitions do offer a little bit of protection. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entries: Blue dots are BUY signals and purple dots are SELL signals. Exits: The 'x's are Exit signals. Red 'x's mean close either BUY or SELL trades. Blue 'x's mean close BUY trades. Purple 'x's mean close SELL trades. StopLoss and TakeProfit: These are really the only two settings you need to calibrate according to your trading preference. The default values of 1.8xADR for StopLoss and 0.4xADR for TakeProfit are good starting points. Note: I will not entertain baby questions and my response to such questions will sound rude. Before you ask a question, be sure to have read the thread. Do your homework. Have fun. I do. Attached File(s) R4M-BDX_19230.zip 468 KB | 552 downloads

100% or nothing I posted this in the other thread. I thought I should share it here for readers here. Do not use anything less than 100% ADR. You may and will probably lose your account if you are not careful. 100% could mean 2 things. 1. 100% ADR offsets (This applies to HTF - H4, D1). The bands then become a dynamic 200% ADR range. I strongly recommend this for beginners. See below my settings. I trade 28 major pairs plus Gold and Silver on H4 and D1. On H4 I use 100% ADR for the Band widths. On D1, I use 150% ADR offsets. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. 50% ADR offsets (This applies to LTF - I trade H1). The bands then become a dynamic 100% ADR range. This could work for scalpers but you are carrying a huge risk of adverse price swings. Get in and get out. When things go south, take the loss and run. See my settings below. I trade only 28 major pairs on H1. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

New Update and Release Thanks to R4M's hard work and bug hunters in the house. We found bugs and R4M corrected them. Read here for updates about the bugs. This version fixes 3 minor bugs. * There was a bug related 4-digit brokers and calculating SL / TP. * There was a bug related to brokers that use symbol suffixes -- e.g. EURUSD austd * There was a bug that caused a new trade to open when the EA was reloaded and there was a BUY or SELL signal on the current bar. Download the new version here . Remember to appreciate the man behind the selfless effort. Note: I will not entertain baby questions and my response to such questions will sound rude.

My setup Below is a snapshot of the setup on my account. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Can it be so difficult to follow safety? Can it be so difficult to do something simple? Over on the other thread, I see loads of complaints on LTF. Despite all the warnings, they keep going at it. The big swings on LTF is hard to track for this system. You need to adjust the width of the bands to something that follows standard price movement. I already stated this earlier. It is 100% or nothing. Ignore this to your account's peril. You will most likely lose your money on M15 (30% ADR) with this system. The purpose of testing is to find if something good can come out of it but clearly M15 will take you down south on this system. Stay on the side of safety. I recommend the following: H1 (50% ADR offset = 100% ADR Bandwidth) H4 (100% ADR offset = 200% ADR Bandwidth) D1 (150% ADR offset = 300% ADR Bandwidth) Note: I will not entertain any post with TFs less than the ones recommended.

Bishopdotun, I would like to say thank you for your joint work with R4M and continuous effort to improve this awesome strategy. I appreciate your recommendations to trade bigger TFs and I agree that less trades does not mean less earned green pips, plus added peace of mind is a huge bonus. I tried H1 with the same settings you suggested and I found that it still could have too many trades for my taste so H4 is good and reliable in my view. I also like to try D1 TF, I did not try it yet. Thank you and all the best.

Dear sir Many thanks’ for your thread. I use a strategy a little bit like yours and your indicator is really better then the indi I am using. I download the last package post 518 and test the indicator r4m bdx adr and the EA named R4M BDX EA. First with the indicator The indi do not trace the same bands when I use it during the test and if I put it on the template when the test is finish. So I consider that I can have more entries then I can detect if I just use a template and insert the indi. Second with the EA Template in H4 The EA (in this test) open buy trade when the price is below the lower line of the indi. What I do not understand, each time it reached the tp , it open a new buy trade again and again . It continues to open buy trade when the price is above the upper line of the indi. So 1 there is a bug or two I don’t understand the strategy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Regarding the H1 time frame If you have time can you have a look on (ADR 45) Buy when the price touch the lower band + grid 10 pips (for example) And tp ( for all buy open trades)when the price return to the blue band Sell when the price touch the upper band + grid 10 pips for example And tp (for alls sell open trades) when price return to the blue band.

New Updates @R4M have done the magic again. Thanks to feedback from the community, further improvements have been achieved and you can relax better when trading. Read information about the updates here Download the latest versions of the EAs and Indicators here What changed? * The main difference between this version and the previous one is the way in which Heiken Ashi transitions are detected. In the latest version the algorithm does not rely on color changes to detect HA transitions and, hence, Entry markers no longer appear to repaint. In the previous version the algorithm detected HA transitions based on color change but the color of the most recent HA bars flickered causing entry markers to repaint. * Included a standalone Heiken Ashi indicator called R4M-HeikenAshi.ex4. This is the standard Heiken Ashi indicator with a few very minor modifications. However, it is absolutely required since it is used by the R4M-BDX-ADR.ex4 indicator. Previously the Heiken Ashi code had lived in the R4M-BDX-ADR.ex4 indicator, but now it lives in the R4M-HeikenAshi.ex4 indicator. * Removed a few diagnostic Alert messages. @R4M forgot to remove it in the previous version. * In addition to the 3 EAs, there are now two indicators -- R4M-BDX-ADR.ex4 AND R4M-HeikenAshi.ex4. They both must be installed in the 'Indicators' folder. The Indicators and EAs R4M-BDX-ADR.ex4 -- this is the indicator work horse. The EA's get their signals from this indicator. R4M-HeikenAshi.ex4 -- this indicator is required by the R4M-BDX-ADR.ex4 indicator. R4M-BDX-DashboardEA.ex4 -- dashboard EA for manual trading R4M-BDX-EA.ex4 -- single pair, auto-trading EA R4M-BDX-AllPairs.ex4 -- multi-pair, auto-trading EA Attached File(s) R4M-BDX_19237.zip 538 KB | 478 downloads

Home Stretch We are almost at the end of development for the indicators and EAs. It has been a journey. At this point, the purpose of the thread has been achieved. I could not think of any changes that can provide any significant improvement to trading results. @R4M and I have looked at it in different dimensions and I have concluded that this would be the last major update to the trading logic except someone shows us a statistically proven addition that will significantly improve the trading outcome. We don't want suggestions, we want additions with statistical proofs of how it will improve trading outcomes. On new suggestions @R4M may take a break from further development. He needs to enjoy the fruits of his hard work. He needs to focus on other projects of his. However, there may be suggestions on cosmetic changes to improve dashboard display. Those suggestions are welcome but must come with display examples to guide his work. This does not mean he will attend to it immediately but may be included in the to-do list and will attend to when he has the time. Bug Hunting Please put the new versions to test. Use the recommended settings. Let's be sure everything works fine. All reported bugs will be addressed with top priority. How to trade In the subsequent posts, I will share how I setup my trading. Watch out for them and digest them before reacting. As I have stated before, I will not entertain baby questions. I will not entertain conversations on charts with less than H1. I will not entertain questions that has been treated on this thread or on @R4M's thread. Make sure you read both thread before asking the question. Otherwise, you may not like my response.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
H1 / H4 / D1 Combination What did I learn from the combination of the short-long term cycles on same account. - I am able to catch the different moves in the market. Not all but most - Sometimes my positions are hedged - I am either counter-trend or in-trend depending on the cycle I am in and the TF - My stops (entry, exit) are constantly in place - Emergency exits (midline, new opposite trade and HMA exit) are constantly monitored Whatever the situation in the market, I am covered. I also use reasonable lots incase the markets go mad like this morning. I am less focused on news/events. In fact, they help my trades to hit TP. The world is full of leaders who spit rubbish all the time. Therefore, you cant really judge the direction of price based on fundamentals. Therefore, I am inclined to trade what I see based on BDX. Mean reversion is an age-old strategy that has stood the test of time. BDX is only a derivative of it. I have not seen a free mean reversion strategy that is as complete and effective as BDX. I didn't mean to say BDX is perfect, but it does the job as close to a discretionary trader as possible based on the rules. Different TFs have trades in play and are monitored by the magic number.

You, robots4me and other great contributors here has done more than expected and you all are highly appreciated. Thanks You said you guys are getting to the end of the updates and tweaking, that’s okay but theirs is an area that I think should be touch a little, that is the area of adding FONTS options to the Dashboard Ea, so that one can easily adjust the Ea and its’ currency pairs to fit different screens.

Please report the same bug on @R4M's thread. I prefer that we report all bugs over there. This thread is about trading and setups that is working. From the first picture, I can tell that you may have been switching between TFs. However, I cannot tell if you switched the TF for the All pairs EA. Based on the positioning of the trades, you may have launched the EA on a TF that's lesser than H1 and later switched to H1. In that process, the EA would have launched some trades. We need to reproduce that bug. Since this is a demo account, there is nothing to lose. Do the following: - Kindly close the trades opened by the EA - Check if subsequent trades are also behaving similarly - Post pictures of the next 3 trades placed We can have a look after that.

I closed all trades manually as suggested by @BishopDotun (in profit though) I guess this screenshot is better

--- 帖子 #503 ---
@feast -- I don't think you understood. I wanted to see the timestamps to see when the trades were opened. It could be those trades were previously opened by a different EA, or by BDX from last week, or even manually. Also, in your Trade and Account History tab enable "Comments" so we can see the MagicNumbers. I'm going to leave it to you to figure out. If you can identify a bug then please let me know.

End of day report Today ended this way. +1000 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
@robots4me Please don't get tired of me. The attachments is how best I understood what you want. No other EA was enabled on the account. And the 3 trades were opened immediately I loaded the EA I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
That's precisely why an option to set a percentage-risk per trade (automatic rounded position-size calculation according to SL pips-distance and account equity/balance), would help a lot... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

--- 帖子 #479 ---
@feast -- I'm not tired of you. But now that I can see the MagicNumbers then I have an explanation. The MagicNumbers for those open trades have a '4' -- which tells me they were opened on an M30 chart. A while back I posted the explanation of how MagicNumbers are composed. In other words, those trades were not opened on an H1 chart.

Hi, Today (26 august) - 64 pips 12 pairs D1, H4, H1 With your settings Don't understand .... Maybe because you change the MinPercentAdrCup setting from 10 to 0 ? ! Not me Cheers jf

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi. Maybe the combination of the higher tf with h1 and the weekend gaps shaked something. For example a exit by HMA transsition on the daily could be a huge loss... I dont think it have to do withe cup setings. Just my two cents. Greets.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi and thanks, Do you see an huge loss in the picture ? Gold - 130 ok This picture is open + close trades since only monday 26 august. So not this week-end, so not gap ... Cheers friend jf

This one isn’t for you.

Why do you trade Gold? Strategy is based on ADR. Under normal conditions , ADR is more respected in Forex markets. You have more than enough pairs to trade in Forex. Just my two cents. Regards, Blackeagle

Hi Bishopdotun, thanks for all what you have do here. I just have a question about running 3 EAs on a single MT4 account (H1, H4 and D1) like you do. you have set the max number of trades to 4 on the 3 EAs, is it 4 trades per EA ? For example I currently have 4 open trades on USD/CAD, all 4 opened by the H1 EA : Attached Image (click to enlarge) It reached the limit of 4 trades for this EA. But if I look on the 2 other EAs they have on the dashboard the 4 USD/CAD open trades : Attached Image (click to enlarge) what would happen if there were conditions to open a trade on H4 or D1 EA ? would it be blocked by the limit of 4 trades ? Regards

--- 帖子 #493 ---
This question has been answered 1000 times. Pity people don't do their homework. You just want everything done for you like a toddler. Please do some reading before asking questions. Please do. "MaxOpenTrades" setting applies to each pair for each EA.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hi JF, I see two reasons for the difference in results between you and bishopdotun : The first and probably the main reason : his EAs run for more days than yours, so he had trades from last week that closed yesterday The second one : you said that you use 12 pairs, on his report there are 25 pairs + Gold + Silver Regards

Cycles within cycles The UCad shots below tells you more information about how I trade. The long trades that just closed were opened from the H1 setup while the shorts were opened on the D1 setup. Each is going about the business independently. H1 longs just closed when price touched the midline.

Trade report Today has been fairly ok. I had a couple of XagUsd trades closed for losses which wiped out the gains. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have now disabled Gold and Silver trading entirely. Better suited for D1 trading with wider stops than major pairs. They have wide swings and often look manipulated. I will stick to my standard 28 pairs until I grow sufficient deep pocket to handle DD on exotic pairs.

Hi Bishopdotun. Running 19233 for the last 48 hours from week start. Using the recommended settings you posted earlier on a Demo account for the 1H charts Allpairs. The initial prognosis seems favourable to say the least. I've just started 19237 in unison with 19233 for the start of day 3, with the same inputs, and will compare the results at the end of the week. While I realize Demo data is somewhat unreliable compared with live data, it should show a great deal of accuracy going forward. As you can see in the charts, 94 trades with great returns and excellent stats, just 2 loses. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi, Sometimes spread exceed 80 (GBPNZD here)

--- 帖子 #511 ---
forget the demo stuff and concentrate on the interrupted trading. don't forget to post the total outcome at the end of the week. A system that works nicely in demo trading will also do well in your real account. what really affects the real account trading is our human emotions and if we can pretend and allow the sweet ea to do its job uninterrupted, the likelihood of getting great results are certain.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
@lecelte -- yes, and what's the point? The EA has a MaxSpreadPoints setting that protects you from opening new trades when the spread is too high for your comfort level. The purpose of the Alert is to let you know there was an Entry signal but that it was ignored because the current spread for that symbol is higher than MaxSpreadPoints.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Exactly what we want. Block trades when spread is over the set limit.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi, Yes exactly ! Block open only or block also close ? Nice day jf

--- 帖子 #515 ---
@lecelte -- think about it. Google your question. It only makes sense to check the spread before opening a trade.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Every trader dreams of that result: - Low DD - High win rate - High profit factor It's just +90 trades. Too early to judge. Let's see what it looks like after 1000 trades assuming you don't change anything.

Strategy Update Since the introduction of BDX, my trade performance has improved significantly. With BDX, we no longer trade MTF. Each TF has its own parameters with strong emphasis on ADR. BDX also makes it easy to trade on LTF without having to look at what HTF is doing. After several tests, I settled with H1, H4 and D1 TFs. However, after analysing my results, I realised that H1 trades are the most frequent and most successful. Next is H4. D1 trades take very long time to develop. D1 trades require sufficient patience and balls. Those are in short supply for me when it comes to FX. For longterm swing traders, this is perfect. For me, it is not. I prefer to allocate the lot to H1 trades where I can turnover the investment several times before the D1 trade matures. H1 trades mostly have a live span of max 2-3 days before they either get closed by stop loss or midline or HMA exit. I can reduce the time of exposure of trades and potentially increase my returns. This is an observation based on my results so far. The future outcome may be different. What next Given the above explanation, I have now allocated my D1 lot to H1. Therefore, I have suspended trading on D1. I will now be closing all my D1 trades at either BE or small profit or stop loss. Now I have the AllPairs EA on H1 and H4 charts. I also increased the lot on H1 to balance my risk calculation.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Recovery is in progress I closed out several nasty trades on Gold and Silver yesterday. Those are best suited for D1 and they carry huge risk. At this point, I decided to suspend trading on exotics and Metals. I do not have the patience to ride out the swings neither am I a trend trader. Since yesterday, I have recovered some of the losses. Should be all covered today and the account can look up to exciting times ahead. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi friend, dont take it for rude, but the EA seems to work perfect. Why always request for new features that can be done easily on other ways? Thats why many creators of Ea`s leave their threads. R4M and BD have posted that this thing is ready in meanings of features. So thats realy good, they are not willing to optimize it to death. Now its time to trade and make money. These brilliant minds have given it to us for free in a very pleasant way. Please dont destroy that. That Bot is too important for me and sure for others. Cheers buddie.

I have no thoughts about anything. No BS filtering. I don't want to sound rude. So I will be simple and straight. What you just did is what kills retail traders. You don't need anything to select pairs. Btw, you have not even used what we have neither have you contributed anything. Your first contribution is a suggestion of a tool which have failed many traders. Also, It is clear you have ignored the rules here about pictures of indicators. I don't want to see all these crawling snakes anymore. I am sorry friend, I will minimize your post, not as an insult but as a warning to all others who will want to do the same. Don't post suggestion of indicators here. On this thread, we are done with development. We are not adding anything new. We only want to test and correct bugs. I believe that is bold enough for all; even the blind can see.

You are definitely doing something wrong. Unfortunately, this is not Forex101 class. This issue has been dealt with countless times already. If you have read the first page, you will notice that this system isnt for beginners. You sound like one. Here is a list of things to check - Make sure you placed indicators and EAs in the right folders - Make sure only the tradable symbols are in the market watch window - Try to input the symbols you want to trade in the appropriate section of the EA settings and disable marketwatch - Some brokers like mine have both EURUSD (not tradable) and EURUSDaustd (tradable) in the marketwatch. So typing the symbols you want to trade helps. If you have tried all that and it doesnt work, then you will need to upload screenshots. Note: If we get to the point where we are going back and forth with screenshots and I find out that you were doing something wrong then you would have wasted everybody's time. I may block you. This thread is not for beginners.

This is how close at midline works After the touch of the midline, we wait for the candle to close. On the open of the next candle we execute the closure. By delaying till close, the price could jump up in your favour. It could also reverse. In most cases, it will head up higher to TP is your TP isnt far away. My TP is = ADR band distance from midline. In the scenario below, the price reversed a lil and we closed on the open of the next candle. Earlier today, One of my trades jumped to TP. It all depends on price movement but we never miss closing on the open of the next candle once we hit the midline. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So if I set my TP at 0, It will close at midline correct? thanks

--- 帖子 #641 ---
For % ADR=50, you need to set your TP=0.5 to close the position at midline. TP is your set number x ADR. For %ADR=100, your TP should be 1.0 for midline close. But midline is moving :-) Regards, Blackeagle

@Valuejager -- thanks for your understanding and good nature. Authoring a thread a FF is a new experience for both @bishopdotun and myself. He has deep trading experience, whereas I am a rookie. I compensate with programming experience. So we all come to the forex table with strengths and weaknesses. We don't expect everyone to understand everything by stringing together a bunch of disjointed posts. So questions are certainly allowed and are appropriate. Most people here have been great and clearly are working with us. But there are people who think they'll save themselves time and are willing to use us. I don't know if they are idiots, lazy, self-centered "takers" or some combination. Sometimes its easy to tell -- e.g. @Idne's post above. Other times it's more difficult and I or @bishopdotun guess wrong. Our threads have grown and we feel obligated to help people succeed with the BDX strategy. As long as someone is making an effort and not just using us to save themselves some time (at the expense of wasting ours) then all is good.

You seem to forget that this isn’t a crystal ball. You sound like someone still searching for the holy grail. Sorry to disappoint you. This isn’t. It’s a guide. It’s not perfect. It’s your choice to use it or not. If you are comfortable, use the EA. Otherwise, pass. We have gone very far ahead of that type of conversation with sufficient protections in place. You probably need to do some reading to catch-up on what we are doing here. All systems have risks. All trades have equal chance of success and failure. What makes success more is understanding price behavior with protections in place should things go south. We don’t want to see any other snake-type indicator crawling on your screenshot.

Oh, I am no master., and against the huge forex ocean we are all small..and sorry about the stochastic at the bottom. Cant rid myself of them just yet. To me this is very convincing, and I think it is the basket approach that will make it successful. the 18-28 pairs that most seem to be using. thats great. (and the multipair EA is really nicely done mr Robot!) However, I will be cautious in using the indicators individually for one trade/pair - it increases probabilities yes, but it is the basket that makes all the difference. And that basket must be composed of all the major groups, i.e euro based, commodities based, and yen based. They don't all move these groups at the same time, and correlations differ at any time between them, but with them all in the basket, the account will not get burned out if one of the groups is in a major grind that eats the boundaries of these channels for prolonged time. kr, I

New Release An updated version is out. Thanks to @R4M on this new one. I know he has a tight schedule but he found time to give us this gift. Thanks to all those testing and providing feedback. We have nailed the multiple orders demon now. You can rest easy knowing that your account will still be there when you wake up. The updates. Look here to read about the new release. What changed? In this new release, we have fixed multiple orders per bar. Now, you get only one order per bar. Before, the code loops through only open orders. Now, it also checks closed orders. If there had been an order opened within the current bar, whether still open or closed, no further trades will be allowed on that bar. Also, there were cases where the signal bar is large and by the time the trade is executed, price is already on the wrong side of the midline. Now, the EA does extra checks to prevent that.

It's weekend and it has not been tested in a live environment. Make sure you test before you instal it on a live account. The updates. Look here to read about the new release. What changed? 1. This version fixes the bug where a price spike that spans an outer band and midline (and which includes both an Entry and Exit signal) could cause trades to be repeatedly opened and closed. 2. BDX is restricted to support only standard 28 forex symbols -- no metals (e.g. gold, silver), energies, commodities, exotics.

This can't be too serious. R4M has made this stuff pretty bullet proof. See here ... https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post12456236 Make sure indicators are in the indicators folder and EAs are in the experts folder. Cheers, Robin

MasterNed...... Gosh.... read the thread. I repeat, read the thread. At least, read the first page. Is that difficult? Someone has given you something for free. The least you can do is do your home work. You waste everybody's time by asking such questions because clearly you don't understand what we are doing here. One more ignorant post and you lose the ability to ask questions here. Edit: @MasterNed: I am sorry for being rude. But at this point I have to be. Imagine if everybody is asking that type of question. If you have read and understood the strategy you wouldn't have asked the question. I want us to deal with relevant and important stuff. I don't want first timers in the thread to have difficulty in reading the thread because of several newbie questions filling the pages. Save your time and mine by reading at least the first 2 pages. Make sure you follow the links as well. Let's keep the thread clean. Thank you.

Hi Guys, I must thank Bishopdotun in the way he controls this thread. Well done Bd. You certainly come from the school of hard knocks and you know what it takes to keep positive collaboration and this thread together. Your system is sound, testimony to your experience is what I am experiencing, and we will work from here. Nothing comes easy and there will be periods of drawdown. I urge all newbies not to go live without proper testing and perhaps reducing the pairs to trade. Cheers Guys.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Thank you @Wavegarrick. Testing, Testing and feedback. That’s all we want. Detect an an extreme and trade away. We don’t want to spend eternity teaching people how to trade this when everything is already available. Just use and enjoy. Many green pips to you my friend and everybody reading.

Thank you BP for your response, I read...read...and read some more. It appears the problem is with the broker. I installed the program on two separate accounts with separate brokers. ICMarkets gave me NO issues and runs perfectly.....as for FXTM gave me plenty of issues and no trades.... So, my conclusion is if your having issues, its either the broker you are using or YOU didn't install it correctly...... Thanks again BP

Hi Guys, Despite a slump into late last week, the Ea has recovered immaculately this week and the results remain impressive. My settings have not changed from my last post. Attached current results. Please don't look at the multiple trades with GbpNzd, EurGbp and UsdCad. I somehow missed uploading the latest version 19243, my bad. So far all looking good today. Have a great week. Cheers.

Results from the 29th Aug to date. I am running the settings as suggested by Bishopdotun and using just the 1H TF. My intention is to run those settings for the month of sept with no manuel interventions at all, So they will remain running until they drop. Good or Bad. I will not be closing at the weekend or for any news etc. Despite a very poor start to the week the R4M-BDX All Pairs EA recovered and is into profit which I think is remarkable and a testament to the creators.

@pet3250 Great to see real results here. Daft question maybe but is that P&amp;L Summary box an indicator? Mark

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hi! I think the EA/indi are awesome as they are today. Simple is what they are but effective. No need for any indicator to be added anymore as they are on the bug-fixing/testing stage. So let's test the heck out of it. Your indicator is a currency strength indicator and it is no use in this strategy. This is a reversal strategy not a trend following one. cheers,

Not a holy grail! Sorry to disappoint you. Traders are always looking for holy grail. The hunt never stops....... Now some people want BD instead of BDX. Why? 2 days of huge swings. &amp; The EA almost always recover if you let it do the job. The usual rhetoric has erupted again. Add this, add that, remove this, remove that. Too many sauce spoils the soup. You wont get it better than this. There is no evidence that any new adjustment will make a significant improvement on your results. At least test for 3-4 months of consistency. My judgement so far is that it works. Certain market conditions will wrong foot the strategy occasionally but market doesn't move in a straight line and there is sufficient evidence that BDX will cashout during the inevitable reversal. However, there are great arguments from Vicente, Blackeagle and Lemercenaire. The argument is between CC &amp; HA. &amp; the trade-off of much fewer signals. This will be evaluated again and we will find a simpler solution. There is no going back on the band type we settled with. Evidence shows it supports the fundamentals for this strategy and it works really well. Compared to previous bands, we have something that's more stable and the shifts are subtle. Do not lose focus of the fact that you will never get a perfect system that predicts price. If there ever was, then there is no market in the first place. There is only approximation based on historical price movement and what we have is close enough. Timing the reversal entries is the only challenge. This system will not make you rich. It will just about help you not to lose your account with potentially a little on top if you are always patient enough for the EA to cash in on reversals.

More evidence Over and over again, BDX delivers reversals. There will always be bad entries and we have taken good feedbacks on how to deal with those. The best traders on FF also have losers. Are we going to discard what works well over a significant amount of trades because of a few trades that go wrong? Most of the moaners are using huge lots relative to their account balance. Sorry, you can't do that with this system. If you manage to return a weekly profit of 1%, you are a star. Shoot for more and you will be the first to complain about how terrible the system is.

I think the bands are perfect. I think we could do minor adjustment on the entry. The CC or the HA H4 MTF on H1 could save a big draw down based on my observation using the same system regards

Hi Toastmaster, those are great results. Just to clarify, do you run three instances of the EA (with different magic #) on H1/H4/D1?

Hi shiva, Yes, I am running one MT4 on google VPS with 3 symbols charts open (H1 chart, H4 chart and D1 chart). Then I run R4M-BDX-AllPairsEA + multi pair EA settings on each chart as given by bishop on post 531( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post12461813 ). I hope this is clear.

Hey Bish, R4M, Long time listener, first time caller...Been following on the sly for quite some time and love your work, development and enthusiasm. Thanks for dragging us along on your trip. Just started trading the latest All Pairs on Thursday last with +796p, a fantastic start! I had one quick question in regards to week end gaps......do you just let the EA run as normal and sort itself out come Monday? or...drop the lot size on Friday to minimise any negative gapping? or...drop the number of trades per pair on fridays for the same reason? or...disable the EA and manually close what is possible for BE or a small profit hopefully, and start again on Monday? I'd appreciate your point of view... Not investment advice, Mike

Thank you for your strategy. I've started to use your EA few days ago, with good results: 277 pips since 09/09 on a live account (yes, I know I have to be careful. I've done homeworks ). After few hours using just H1, i've tried to use H4 too. DD is fair, but I prefer to come back to use just H1, to avoid surprises (H4 have a very large SL/TP, floating trades could create some problem with margin, in an account not big and with a low leverage...). A little idea for the next version of the EA: bool StopTrading = false (by default); With this, in my case I can change it "=true" and let the EA manage the remaining opened trades until the end. Better if the EA can add trades just for opened symbols, so it can close the circle. I talk about the AllPairs version, of course... I can do that now removing all other symbols from PairsToTrade, but that don't prevent from new trades for that symbol after all previuos trades have been closed. The same if I want to stop to use the EA... Not difficult at all for a gifted coder as R4M... PS: I have some other ideas to implement the EA (AllPairs). Not the strategy, I think is good enough, don't need changes... Just some utilities... IE, yesterday I was up of 50 pips, maybe more. Some pair was up, some pair was down. Maybe a: double CloseAllAt=(n pips in profit) could help to stay green, if used wisely. Just my two cents.

First post in thread man... :/

I can convert EA to Forex Tester 3 and do some backtest on multiple pairs with tick data, what do You think? For now we based only on forward tests.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
@R3d -- you can stop the EA from opening new trades by setting MaxSpreadPoints to '0'.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
@Arrr -- really? How? @Arrr -- do you really believe back testing (using old data) is superior to forward testing (using current data)?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Its simple - Forex Tester 3/4 has possibility to backtest multiple pairs in one time. Just need to convert current ea from .mq4 to FT extension, download tick data with variable spread (its historical spreaded saved in tick data) and run. Quality of backtesting is 99%. @robots4me - do i belive in backtests? Let's say - always when im developing any ea - i do forward tests for a few days and then do some backtests for the same period of time. Next i compare the results. If final results are +/- 5% difference - You may base the future of Your account on backtests results

--- 帖子 #732 ---
@Arrr -- you say "JUST". And how are you going to convert *.mq4 to FT. Do you mean you want me to give you the source code? Really? Really? +/- 5%? Where did that come from? What about 6.1%? Or 7.5%? @Arrr -- nice try, but I'm not interested... EDIT: Regarding source code -- are you familiar with *.mqh header files? And header files that include other header files? So your plan would be to port several thousands of lines of *.mq4 code to FT code -- just to run a back test on historical data? @Arrr -- anyone who has been coding *.mq4 for any length of time would know this is much too silly... EDIT: @Arrr -- if you really are inclined there is a much simpler approach. The BDX strategy is very simple and we've been completely transparent about the rules and how it works. All the information and tools are available to you. You don't need to port *.mq4 to FT. Instead, all you need to do is simply just create a TMA midline along with upper and lower bands offset by the ADR. That's it -- this would take less than 10 minutes using *.mq4. With the midline and ADR-offset bands you could then go to town and back test to your heart's content.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
I don't want You code, i just told You all steps how it can be done, so You can do by Yourself if You want. Im just trying to help improve Your job.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
And as we see idea of backtest this strategy seems to be good idea, because as on myfxbook account in link below we have mixed H1, H4, D1 pairs (i think its @toastmaster account) and for now its almost -3000 pips. So it looks that higher timeframe is cancelling all profits from lower timframe. https://www.myfxbook.com/members/toa...UoNsdPwKVsbmzc Personally i have run only H1 and not drwadown for now - not to many trades this week, but still in profit.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
share my idea but if no good... please delete my post. thanks.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
@Arrr. Okay -- and approximately how long would it take me to port several thousand lines of *.mq4 code to FT -- a language I'm not familiar with? And what about all the built-in MQL4 functions that aren't available in FT? Maybe a year? Maybe 2 years? Again, just to run a back test on old data? Again -- running back tests on tick data is a total waste of time -- whether you do in Strategy Tester or FT. It is unreliable -- meaning, it might give a good predicative result, it might give a bad predicative result, it might give an in-between predictive result. But you don't know which. Plus, you can't experiment with different settings because each tick back test takes forever. Plus you can't optimize settings because, again, each tick back test takes forever. It's the same mentality that "more is always better" -- but that's not necessarily so, especially when it uses old data. Shorter forward tests using current data is more reflective of how an EA will perform in the present compared to using 20 years of old data. The guys who think 20 years of old FX data can predict the future have a mental block -- they so much want to believe they have a tool that can predict future performance they just can't see the uselessness. Tick back testing is only useful for exercising an EA to make sure the code faithfully executes the logic. It's just a simulation, not a predictor.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
And last week, as I posted on other thread, H1 was eating up all H4 and D1 profits. That was the reason CC entries suggested but this week I haven't had one single trade on H1 with 100% ADR. Welcome to forward testing. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #738 ---
You asked me how long if i don't se the code - so i can't answer. If built - in function are implemented - that should be not problem. The problem is - if You spend a weeks or months to code it - it looks like the same that You cannot be sure about the future results. So if You can base on the results in the past - how can You base on the results in the future?. Just based on logic? Market condition is changing every year. This year We have nice volatility because of FED, Brexit, economic war US-China etc. If You don't know the structure of the market -You cannot predict anything. But when You realised how Smart Money are kinckg asses of retails - it will be more prodictable for You and everyone. Dont try to find levels when market will retrace. Try to find the places whe SM can hunt Your stop loss. We are everyone looking at the same charts - nothing more. So You see breakout from the consolidation upward? Tadaa - it's a trap. They will breake opposite side. And when You see that they are change the direciton and breake opposite site - You will enter again. Tadaa - stop loss hunted again - they'are going back upwards without many traders with clear way to uptrend. So what if everyone of us will blow down our account, because we are in the very short time of forward testing? You can say - thats' happened sometimes. But in 10 years we were many times in every parts of market structure - so we can have some imagination how the strategy can works. According to Your question from previous post - what about the difference from the results of forward and backtesting of 5%? Different broker - differents spreads - different results. We based on thousand of transacions - not only a few - so we can imagine how this can works. But 1,2 or even 10 transaction with different spread cannot change the overall result. Take care - all brokers are reading all of our "genius" strategies so they can always be prepared for "client profits" And please don't try to attack me (cause i feel it looks like that) - im here to try help everyoune if i can. And finally - market is always in 3 phases - trend, accumulation and distribution. Predicting is nothing more to realise in which phase we are currently. Screen attached for everyone. Let's kick market togheter. Regards Arrr

I'm using 50% ATR - so that can be the difference.

Last week I was using 50% ADR, too when I got huge drawdown. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #704 ---
R4M, clever solution. I love creative ways. 99.9% effective, even if it does not solve the problem of the whole circle (opening more positions to mediate a losing trade - Am I right? Sorry if I'm wrong about the exit strategy...). Just another little problem, I'll show you in a picture... Attached Image (I pay some commissions for this spread... Always for EURUSD, some days it happens even for GBPUSD and USDJPY) PS: I'm now up 880+ pips since 09/09 (+8% in my account), whit just a couple of loss. I'm still waiting for some bigger loss before adding my trade report, I know perfection does not exist, even if I hope to be wrong... In the meantime, I just thank you, guys. Great work.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
@Arrr -- my intent is not to attack you. But you are spreading misinformation -- and that bothers me. Really? With our minuscule accounts in a 5 trillion dollar / day forex market the brokers have nothing better to do than monitor the profits from a handful of FF traders? False -- you DO know which phase you are CURRENTLY in. The HG is predicting which phase you will be in when the next bar arrives. @Arrr -- I appreciate your intent to help, but all the misinformation continues to harm people and you are perpetuating it. Stop reading Internet posts about conspiracies. Just focus on the data and don't worry about the MM's psychology. You make statements but have zero evidence to support them -- they are just beliefs that someone else posted on the Internet. Advising me that I should JUST port MQL software to FT in order to perform more back tests is like advising a starving child to JUST eat more food. It means you really don't have a clue what the problem is or what is really required to solve it -- but that doesn't stop you from giving advice. And there is already too many people like that giving bad advice.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Ok so as You see almost everyone in this thread are losing in their money in mid term - settings are doesn't matter. So finnally everyone of us can spend a lot of time for forward testing only wiht hope that it can work. Don't get me wrong - backtesing of strategy is not spreading miisinformation. Its only the one of ways to avoid potiential threats from the past and avoid it in the future.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
You're putting words in my mouth, but that's okay. If you've read the thread you will know that there has been a lot of back testing and fiddling with settings. There has also been a lot of forward testing. But most importantly, we've provided indicators and total transparency so you can see with your own eyes what the logic is. This strategy has very simple logic that you can see and touch. If the logic doesn't make sense to you then why bother back testing or forward testing? The most important thing is to understand the simple logic and use your eyes and brain to see how it reacts to the data. We've reached the point where the only purpose of back testing is to check for bugs and to ensure the code faithfully executes the intent of the logic.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Exactly! but it's hard to do many forward tests with different settings and timeframes. But by having a week of backtesting many settings and timframes You could be closer to good results then doing forward testing and change setting every week if results are bad. It may take more time to forward test then coding it. I understand idea and i totally agree with that. Maybe for You it's stupid discussion with me about that and You don't agree my point of view to save a lot of time for forward testing - so i will try to code that TMA for multipair and do some backtest. Then i will back with that to You.

Based on your previous post, I believe this is result is from H1 trading only. Would you please share you trade report (open and closed trade reports separately), H1 ADR % and your entry method at weekend as we are all forward testing and it will be good to now? Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Hi Blackeagle. Sure. The account is not so big, thats why I'm up 10% with 0.01 lots per trade. (I can deal with a 10% DD, stable around 50/70 euros since yesterday. Before H4 activation, DD was around 15/20 euros... I use a large leverage. Wisely. That give me more margin. ) H1: ADR%= 50 (20,10) entry method=HA transitions H4: ADR%=100 (20,10) entry method=HA transitions I've used set files provided by Toastmaster (post 718 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post12489567 ) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Looking to magic, it seems to be the H4 system the most used (Magic=6666.

By far i am having normal numbers.positive at least.Forward testing h1 and m5.Core of system as always a good money management, and low leverage,..and of course and emergency stop loss due to the inevitable black swan days...But i like the logic behind, because its the reality,..in some point everything try to come back to the mean.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
D1 timeframe trades are not happening on their own, they seem to be getting filtered out by the spread filter when the market rolls over each day and I only seem to get D1 trades when i restart mt4. Perhaps offsetting the check for buy/sells by 2 hours or so to avoid the high spreads would fix this?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
I often like to observe% ADR at the same time in 3 states: - 100/10080 (W1) - 64/1440 (D1) - 32/240 (H4) can be BD or BDX index. However, I like the BD more because it reflects the trend when it ends H4, D1, W1. BDX can be monitored, but now when I put BDX on my computer, it seems to be slow, it seems to take up a lot of resources for running CPU. I suggest, if given R4M create 1 index as above, configured by color according to H4, D1, W4. So that we can observe the overall market. Currently BDX (latest version 52) manual tracking is failing, not running in MT4.

@R4M @BD After a week of test on a live account, just my two cents about DD and risk management. The DD have reached 20%, using a 0.01 lots on a live account (700 eur). Today, monday, most of the trades have been closed positively, the actual DD is 2%. Maybe luck, maybe strategy. The account is now up 15% (in a week. Great result! Thank again guys). I've decided to exclude pairs with larger ADR: GBPAUD (ADR 20= 175) GBPNZD (ADR 20= 201) EURNZD (ADR 20= 128) EURAUD (ADR 20= 112) GBPCAD (ADR 20= 158) GBPCHF (ADR 20= 114) GBPJPY (ADR 20= 143) The system uses ADR for SL/TP, excluding pairs with large ADR I expect a lower DD (for a small account is essential). I'll let you know... This could be coded as filter, of course (extern int MaxADR20=xx). Regards.

You don't need that. Just check the volatility calculator and apply it yourself.

Hi dethkult. Not sure about what you are talking about... Could you explain? (I'm reading a lot of threads, maybe I'm missing something here...)

--- 帖子 #718 ---
You are trading this strategy with €700 and 0.01? Are you kidding? You will lose your money. This is the reason why I shout that this strategy is not for newbies. Pairs with large ADR are the most profitable. Removing them will totally screw your results Goodluck.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Correct, these pairs makes most of profit. Here's attached my results from 6.09.19 So far so good. Only H1. 50% - 1,2-0,4 R/R

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Thank you bishopdotun for your advise. I'm aware, and I do that because I can do that... I'm not a newbie, my friend... I'm here since 2010, I've coded a lot of EA and Indies (not on FF, of course), and tested a lot of strategies, so I know what it means create something really profitable: it's very difficult, 'cause market change every year, month, week. Brexit? Yeah. But what if Russia stop using USD and start using EUR in international exchange? How will change the strenght of USD and EUR in forex? A lot of things are happening, out there... First: if this EA, that I check and correct manually, closing wrong positions when I think it's time (very rarely, btw), can blow away a small account because of DD and margin call, better know, right? Or be aware about that. Thank you, I know you are worried people will lose money, and I agree with you. But I know the risk. Second: because of the small account, I've suspended pairs with large ADR, and I'm using just 10 - 12 pairs. Pairs with larger ADR are the most profitable, but the most risky too. Yes, my results will be not excellent, but my account will probably survive, maybe will grow a little, and I will collect information to give you to improve the EA, risking my money, not yours. I don't expect to become rich with this account or this strategy. I will not become poorer, if this account disappear... I find it interesting, so I'm here. That's all. IMHO , I'm not sure using pairs with lower ADR , fractionating the risk , reducing possible DD , is a stupid idea. This is not a trend following strategy, it's a (very good) reversal strategy, with some risk. Everything have to be proportional to the risk a trader can afford: high risk, high reward, low risk, low reward. Friday, GBPNZD have had a 368 pips rally. Up. The system was searching for sell positions. Very hard to manage, I think. If I'm wrong about low ADR, you will be the first to know. If I'm right, you will be the first to know. Next saturday. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Your thread is the first I'm posting in since my subscription to FF, long time ago. I hope you understand how I judge your work. If you like, I can do as everybody else, be silent, downloading the EA, using it with success, or not, and never share my results, my opinions, my toughts. Who cares? But maybe my toughts can be usefull (or useless, why not?) to improve the strategy, or just the EA, reducing loss and DD. I think a forum is the perfect place to share experience, and I thank you for this thread. But this is your space ? What do you prefer? Silent people or shared experience? I will respect your decision.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I'm feeling so stupid... Sorry for bothering you for my carelessness. My weekly report is useless, all the trending pairs are there, and the DD is a little high because of that (the same of the previous week). I probably will close manually some trade, before the end of the day. I'm still in profit, sure, but I don't like some position I'm in... Thank you.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hello, Do you use your own settings or from bishopdotun? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hello @R3d -- no problem. And it's big of you to let us know...

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Hi Alex, Yes just using Bish's settings, though this week I've intervened a little. Closed out a few just short of target on reverse, closed a few on strong reverse for break even and closed out two that ran past midpoint TP for some extra pips. So all up perhaps 200 pips up on just letting it go. I've finished the week with a the NZ pairs letting the team down (still in play) If they were to be liquidated as they are...it would be around +800 pips for a turbulent week. Which is still great! because to be up that far on short time frame manual trading is quite the challenge I intend re-setting on the new version this week in the hope of cutting some of the negative trends short. Overall still very impressed with the development and always loved trading back to median. Thanks Bish, R4M, and everyone else involved.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Very interested to see how the new exits impact your results for next week.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I've made a mistake, so my report is not what I wanted. It includes again all GPBs pairs. Next week, the report without them. But, here my almost two weeks of trading.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Nice numbers r3d,..which were your settings?..D1 on h1. 100%? Thanks Awe

--- 帖子 #771 ---
The same used by Toastmaster in post 708, except for Max Trades. H1: ADR 50% (SL 1.2 TP 0.4; Max trades=4) H4: ADR 100% (SL 2.5 TP 1.0; Max trades=2) A big change, this week: Use Market Watch for pairs to trade= false; Pairs To Trade: H1: AUDCAD,AUDCHF,AUDNZD,AUDJPY,AUDUSD,CADCHF,CADJPY,CHFJPY,EURCAD,EURJPY,EURUSD,EURCHF,EURGBP,GBPCAD,GBPUSD,NZDUSD,NZDCAD,NZDCHF,NZDJPY,USDJPY,USDCHF,USDCAD H4: AUDCAD,AUDCHF,AUDJPY,AUDUSD,AUDNZD,CADCHF,CADJPY,CHFJPY,EURUSD,EURCHF,EURGBP,GBPUSD,NZDUSD,NZDCAD,NZDCHF,NZDJPY,USDJPY,USDCHF,USDCAD The reason is simple: I had a DD of almost 20% the first week, and the same the second week. I want to try to reduce the risk of a large DD. Sure, I will have a minor gain. But that's the point: if I'm right, with a controlled, low DD, in October I will raise the Max Trades to 5 or 6. In the future, I will watch to raise my lots from 0.01 to 0.02. If I'm right... All depends from the DD in the next two weeks... I'm using the system on a real account. It was 700 euros, now 850 (+20% in 2 weeks). That's because I want to feel the fear to lose everything, and to use my experience to avoid that. I closed 6 trades manually. Probably, it was better let them run again. But the risk of a larger DD was too high. So, no regrets. As R4M and BD said, this is a tool... I think nothing is better than our eyes and our mind, but I cannot watch 28 pairs every 5 / 10 minutes. So, I let the EA run, but some final decision, how and when exit from a trade, is mine. Regards.

Thank you Toastmaster for the detailed report. - The recovery after introducing CC is stellar - The performance is consistent with what I expect. Without the DD, the account should be around +5% - Some pairs perform better that the other. GN is the best pair. Earlier tests by @R4M showed this. Please maintain the CC setup for another one month.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
you are most welcome bishopdotun. I concur with you. With less DD, the account will have profit consistency. Come to think of it, the exponential growth in profit as evident above was within the last 11 days!... I will surely maintain this set up going forward unless there is a major update in future that in my discretion believe it will positively affect the performance. green pips.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Outstanding effort. What I would say - and not just in relation to this method - is that if you want to save your account from any drama, stay away from CHF. In fact keep a very large barge-pole handy and use it. The CHF is notoriously SNB manipulated and is generally avoided, certainly for anything other than HFT scalping.

thank you I think 1 month is not reliable to judge which entry method work best. Do you have an evaluation which show performance 4h vs 1h Maybe one more information would be interesting: show profit/loss in relation to time "exit minus entry". There is maybe room for improving the profit by including a "timestop": e.g close position after x hour Best hundsbua

great to see positive results for 2 months. can u plz share the drawdown level so that we can understand the risk as well.

Hi! I started of course on the BD then use what is the latest as time goes on. As updates come I change also the EAs and indicators but always maintain the corresponding magic numbers for the time frames so that the latest EA will just continue to exit what has been started by the previous version. best regards

Hello, @bishopdotun : Both threads were going very well, until all of a sudden they started to slow down, up to the point of almost being dead now... What happened with the system and all its satisfied "testers"? Are you still successfully trading it with auto-pilot (as it was intended) on a daily basis? I've seen that lately you've only been involved with the following strategy: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=943338 Also with some tools created by R4M .

Hi, thanks for keep sharing your results =) Although I think your losses have nothing to do with the latest EA version. For me, it's clearly because of current market's chaotic volatility/ranges, specially regarding the Pound Sterling... So just a coincidence... And about selecting only the currently "best performing pairs" (now with the exception of GBP, because obvious reasons), it won't help you for the long-run, cause the ones that have been poorly performing, may become the best in the near future, and viceversa; but you will never know when their gears start to shift. I reiterate: until the "Brexit" situation defines and their currency finally settles down, everyone should have stopped messing with it in the current period/cycle, at least with automated swing-trading strategies. There must be universal balance/neutrality/equilibrium between all the main global currencies (not pairs) so they can properly "move" and work together; being like the perfect "Swiss Watch" of wealth-transfer: when value increases for one currency, it also has to proportionally decrease for other(s). Hence, the best way to capture most of the fluctuations with this strategy, is using a general 28 pairs basket. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
If I remember rightly you were using 1 trade limit right? So I think that was always going to have an impact. Also were you using auto exit? I posted my results for this week over on R4M thread. Hopefully, more people will post their results and set up going forward.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
The EA has reached stability. Nothing new to be added except you have one. The mission of RBA thread has been accomplished. The purpose was to develop tools for the strategy. The tools have been fully developed. The system works well. Toastmasters results shows that it works but extreme volatility can make things difficult for the strategy. The user must apply discretion. The system was not designed as a set and forget system by the way. It is for experienced traders who can handle DD and knows when to stay out of the market. There is no rule in FF that says one cannot contribute on other threads. I have 2 questions for you. - What do you mean by "testers" ? - what are you trying to achieve by posting exact same question in 2 threads?

I like the BD also, try these: Daily M15 40% ADR CC entry Exit Midline ADR Cup 70% This is working nicely. Quite safe but also gets a decent amount of trades. Weekly H1 100% ADR CC entry Exit Midline ADR Cup 70% This is for nice safe trading.

Hi @ bishopdotun -- Yes, I also agree with you. Sorry for may late reply. To your questions: - What do you mean by "testers"? All the members that were actively trying the EA/Dashboard/Indicator and posting their results, etc. - What are you trying to achieve by posting exact same question in 2 threads? Maybe reaching more people, sorry. * There is no rule in FF that says one cannot contribute on other threads. Of course, I didn't state otherwise...

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Hey @ Toastmaster : Yes, believe it or not... just a coincidence! Between the EA versions 19259 vs 19262-19273 , aside from some relatively minor changes regarding the CC/HA-HAS/mid-line entries &amp; exits (anyway, variables dependent on each's user criteria), the strategy has remained fairly constant; and those differences are in fact significantly smaller than the much bigger variation shown in you equity curve. Pardon me, but... did you actually understand or even read what I tried to say, especially regarding the current behavior of your mainly losing GBP pairs , as well as ALL major currencies in general (also involving the "Law of Large Numbers") ? https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post12571224

Have bug in R4M-BD-ADR indicator, like the screen shot attached below. The signal to close the trade when cross opposite band mark on the wrong band, pls fix it...

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hi dethkult, I am trading H4 and got good results so far. Would you mind to share settings for H1 or lower? Because with mu current settings it will very rarely touch the band on H1. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Yep...you are right! The author R4M knows about that bug and promised to fix it...but unfortunately he did not . Quotation of his post #5633 in his thread: " Okay -- I found the bug in the logic for Opposite Band exits. Turns out I had the closings on the wrong band -- SELLS were closing on the upper band and BUYS were closing on the lower band. The bug has been fixed and will be available in the next release. The next release will also include a few additional minor features. It's almost 2a for me, so I won't get this done today, but hopefully a new release before the market opens tomorrow. In the meantime don't use Opposite Band for Exits -- stick with midline for now." IMHO and moreover the Midline exit functions are unnecessary as we can control the exits much better with our TP option. But unfortunately we are unable to eliminate/turn off this exit option in the BD EA settings. On D1 1440 setting ML exits are too early very often if holding trades overnight. Perhaps someone knows a solution!? Happy weekend, jdva

Hi all no posts for a long time. im using the BD all pairs EA. It’s up 600 pips so far this week. D1 on H1 however, it will not go above 20 total open trades even though other pairs should be giving signals. ive set total open to 50 but I think that’s meant to be per pair anyway. any ideas?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
It worked for a while, but my account went only down. Risk reward you have to use is insane.

I’ll leave it running as it’s on demo to see if it recovers. It would be great to be able to amend the total open trades though. i will also try the BDX all pairs using the same settings I expect. I’ll post how it get on simon - are you still using the system....... how are you doing? cheers RT

Hello everyone This is the question that arose ....If the spread is higher than the one specified in the setting, then the order is therefore not opened ... After some time, the Expert Advisor will repeat the request to open an order? When the day changes, my spreads widen (1.5-2 times). Spreads recover in about an hour .... And because of this, orders are not opened at all on the daily TF. Or is it possible to make small changes to the advisor to solve this problem?
