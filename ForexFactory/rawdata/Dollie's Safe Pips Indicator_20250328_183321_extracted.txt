Many thanks to everyone who has posted in the past and helped me along my way. In appreciation for all your efforts I will share an indic I made out of several indic and so far its been a safe making pips indicator for me. Please feel free to add comments how to improve it even more. Use M4 charts with black background Add the Abosolute Strength Indicator : Make the colours (Inputs) as follows: Black, Black, Black, DeepPink Overlay with RSI 2 (DeepSkyBlue) Apply to : Close Levels : 10 and 90 Style: Silver ( dotted lines) Overlay with Woodies CCISuper Make the colours ( Inputs) as follows: Black, White, Black. Black, Black. Levels 0 Style : Tan Overlay with LSMA Read the indic as follows: On 30 min charts and higher TF's it works well for me. I do day trading I watch a position and close when a move is over, This indicator gives good signals several times a day on 30 mins and 1h TF's. For a BUY : When Blue and Pink line crosses and Blue is above Pink Then wait till Lsma line( green, yellow, red line) goes in between Pink and blue line Also wait till white line( cci6) goes in between Pink and blue Its very safe to enter when LSMA is above 0 And when white line is above 0 as well Its very safe when blue and white line trades almost on top of each other and going sharply in the same direction through 0 More aggresive traders can just use the white line as a guide when it goes through 0 up its a buy When blue and Pink crosses for a buy, make sure white line is above 0..if it is under 0 the move might be very small dont be greedy here just take a few pips or stay out and wait for white to go above 0 Exit: On a Buy - When the Blue line goes above the 90 dotted line .. keep a close look as it shows now over bought. Also look at the Pink line when its near 10 or under, its also shows its time to close for profit. - When LSMA line goes out between Pink and blue

Here is the same indicator on Daily..I cant see how you can lose pips with this one:-) The thing is to have patience and wait till conditions are right... wait till all lines line up and then enter with confidence. I welcome comments to make it even better. I played around overlaying a few different indicators. I am sure some of the guru's on here will be able to overlay even safer, quicker indicators.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Here is 4H GBP I forgot to mention I use MA's : WMA Linear weighted 3 Close SpringGreen and WMA Linear weighted 4 Open MeduimOrchird

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Could you mark on the above day and 4 hour chart where your entry points would be, not sure I can see them, especially on the daily. So on the above 4hr chart entry would be at the close of the 3rd up candle is that correct ?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi, thenk you for sharing your indicators. When do you enter in the market? Only when the candles are closed or in the moment when you see a nice setup? Thanks Uli

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I dont wait for a candle to close, when I see the set up is right, I enter. Beware to enter right before major news etc. For me its like baking a cake without a recipe and the right amount of ingredients, it will fail. So I wait till all condions are met and then I enter. If you wait too long, the move might be over.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
What really increases the probablility of your trade making pips is : Look at the daily chart : Blue and Pink has crossed for a buy Look at the 4h chart : Blue and Pink has crossed for a buy Look at the 1h chart : Blue and Pink has crossed for a buy Look at the 30 m Chart : Blue and Pink has crossed for a buy This is true of all indic when the different TF's all say the same direction eg a buy ,and there are no major news coming up shortly plus its a busy time of day to trade I jump in with confidence when all indic lines up.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
"So on the above 4hr chart entry would be at the close of the 3rd up candle is that correct ?" I personally will enter sooner eg somewhere in the 2nd blue candle that is where both LSMA and white line goes in between Blue and Pink. It is safer to wait till both LSMA and white lines are above 0 ....but I have enough confidence in this indic that when LSMA and white goes in between I enter. A good plan is to enter on candle 2 and then load up the boat further, big time, at candle 3, as it is a much safer trade.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Dollie Will study and come back with comments. Looks good judging on the posts Have you tested is in different pairs? Which pairs do you favour for the system?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I trade mainly GBP but I am sure all indic works on all pairs. I cant see why a certain indicator cant work on a certain pair. I will not use this indic on really short TF's such as 5 min .. its very choppy and will give false signals.. I do look at the 5 min chart before entering to see if its going up or down currently and then I wait till the 5 min lines up as well to maximise my pips.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
How do you set the MA to weighted (WMA) In my indicators there is only a normal MA Under inputs it ask MA Method, but there is no options, please help

--- 帖子 #12 ---
There aren't any weighted moving averages in this system as far as I can see, just LSMA

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Problem solved

--- 帖子 #14 ---

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Oops, didn't see those, sorry

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Looking forward to using your setup! Thank You for sharing FXS

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thanks for the great indicator. Kindly post the template. thanks and best regards, Vasu

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Dollie I developed the template, please check if it is correct.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
first of all,i want to thank you for sharing your system. i like it. and now one question: how about sell signals?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I must say that, in my opinion, you have quite a knack for overlaying indicators! Were these the default settings for the indicators or did you reset them? Nice confirmed entries. And the simultaneous 10/90 OB/OS PT signal looks really good, too! I would say that some time should be spent on this very setup before tweaking it! Just a Newbie's POV! Thanks Again, Really! FXS

--- 帖子 #21 ---
How many TF confirmation do you typically go for? I think that you also mentioned that you go for a lower TF confirmation than you actually trade. Have you tried fading that one? Just topics for discussion. FXS

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I again had a good look at this indic and I made some changes to it, to make it easier to read. I took off the Woodies indic and instead added a CCI 6 ( Go to : Insert, Indicators, Trend, CCI) Set it to : 6 Apply to : Typical price( HLC/3) Style : White , dotted line On the attached chart the red sign means we already know that the trend is up now.... when blue and white goes through 0 almost at the same time and the 2 lines are very near each other it always means a good fast move. This trade was safe to enter for a buy because blue and pink has crossed for a buy and CCI is above 0. And the LSMA line is in between pink and blue. Here a good time to take profit would have been at the green sign. See the hook the blue line is making. Look out for the trend to continue ( we have already taken profit at the green sign.. now it retraces for a bit and another good buy entry would have been at the yellow sign At the pink sign all 3 indic is trading above the 90 mark which tells us over bought... time to close again the trade..as the blue line went sideways and LSMA is turning from green to yellow. As long as LSMA stays green I will stay in. After the pink sign LSMA has traded above the other indicators .. a good sign to stay out of the market.

Thanks for the update! Don't forget to replace the ZERO LINE on the new CCI. FXS

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Dollie: This is off topic but I wanted you to look at the EUR/CAD chart on any MT4 platform this morning before the weekend. I have been tellling you about this event (and for anyone else up at 11 GMT). You don't need indicators to trade this, just watch and buy. The news was expected to be lower, the pre market knew it, nothing else is going on at this time in the morning, and bam! Even if you got in late it was 30+ pips. Moved over 80 for the day so who cares about the spread. Just too early for me. This news event is better if it is not on the same day as NFP and there is a predicted big change. Just watch it over the months.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
My Zero Line isn't staying centered. Can you use zero level with one indicator and outside levels with another? Maybe I don't have it overlayed right. For now I've taken it off of CCI and added a 50 to the RSI. FXS

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hello Friends of Dollie's system. Dollie and I have talked today and I plan to get this forum moving in a new direction. I would like to get together with those who like this method and trade it to post their thoughts and possible trades on a daily basis. I am still learning it but am excited. So more on this tommorrow. Read any successful person’s biography and it goes like this: struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, big struggle, struggle, BIG SUCCESS . See setbacks as proof of your future success. What makes anyone think that trading is any different?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I have been watching Dollie's system for some time now, so any move to activate this thread would be much appreciated. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I'll be interested in giving this system a go but might be hard to watch all the time because I'm at work during the day. Is there an EA in the works? Thank you for the system

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I will post more info starting on sunday after the market opens. I like to look at least 12 pairs and different time frames to see possible trades. If we all work together we can all win. Maybe some people can specialize on certain pairs or time frames. Whatever the group wants. One thing I am going to have to learn how to do is post charts. I need to know how to show just the charts and not the whole screen. Well They say that there’s a pie up in the sky; Waiting for me when I die; But between the day you’re born and when you die; they never seem to hear you when you cry; So as sure as the sun will shine; I’m going to get my share of what is mine….. Jimmy Cliff

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I don't see an EA for this system. I am not a computer wiz by any means, but this indicator requires for you to look at it to make a decision. What times do you work in GMT? There are many trades with different pairs in different time frames, from 15 min to daily charts.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Interesting concept. I love the CCI. Dollie, I have a problem with this intruction: " Its very safe to enter when LSMA is above 0" Now, the lsma is overlayed in the indic window and as the price moves along the relationship between lsma and the zero line changes !? I think the two indics should be some how locked together but I cant see how to do this. See pics 1 and 2, same chart slightly different times. Note the magenta line. I note that the blue and pink aren't locked together either !? Idea's anyone??

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Oh, ok, I'm in EST, right now GMT -4. What pairs work best for me?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Dollie hasn't been able to post lately only read the posts, so that is one of the reasons this forum hasn't done much. But I have talked to her and will give you my best shot at answering your questions. Your example is one that I would not have made a trade. First she uses the CCI not the woodieCCI, she changed that. The order of events to happen to have a good trade with this system are: the commitment of the blue line being strong and close to 1-2pm or 5-6pm on a clock face. Second: the white line must be following the blue line very close as it approaches the 0 line. Your example does not have this qualifier. Third: the pink line must cross the blue line at some point, preferably near the center on the blue line move. Your example has no pink cross. Fourth: Then the lsma moves in the direction of the trade and crosses the 0 line. A good example of this setup was the EUR/JPY H4 chart at 0 GMT last night. What I did was to go back over all the pairs at different time frames on a sunday, took screen shots of them and made a word file with the pictures at all the different times. Then I could go back and look at them all and see how the indicators lined up. Even with a slow week this past week, there were many opportunities with this system.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
How early do you want to get up and what time do you have to leave the computer for the day? You are in some of the best time to trade with the euro session going on. I would look at all the gpy and euro pairs at that time frame. If you are available at 7am EST then I would look at the eur/cad during cad news events like cad unemployment. You also can trade some of the asian session which starts around 7:30pm your time. A little slower market but could be a good one for a newbie (if you are one). During the asian session, watch the gpy/usd and the jpy pairs, and sometimes the aud pairs. euro and swissie don't move much during this session. Or you can look to do longer trades using the H1 and H4 time frames and try to get fewer trades but with more pips per move.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I find that the lsma lags a lot and results in very late entries. I'll do some more back and forward testing to see how critical this is. I really want to keep on top of this, because the system has much potential.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Glad to have you aboard. I agree about the lmsa but what I like about it is when it turns yellow you know there is going to be a change. The blue, white and pink lines are far more important to me. Plus Dollie uses this for bigger time frames like the H1, H4 and daily so lag isn't as important. Here is an example of what I saw (after the fact) last sunday. The indicators on the euro/dollar showed a cross at 4 GMT on the H4, 8GMT on the H1, 9GMT on the M30 and 9:15 GMT on the M15 when the big move happened. I was awake and watching the market during most of this time and didn't see the move coming. What I see (no buy, sell or hold recommendations) is that this indicator MAY let you know that a move is going to happen sometime soon. I am new to this system also so that is why I look forward to help and more minds looking into it.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Is there any reason why I can't backtest this strategy? None of the indicators "repaint" as far as I can see. Thanks for your comments on the lmsa.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I don't know if you can backtest it. Since I have been only studying it for a few weeks, I know that there have been many positive signals in several pairs. You can paper trade it first.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
We know that the US market is closed monday and now I found out that europe is closed sunday night so there will be no real trading until monday's asian session. I hope everyone is open to looking at most of the available pairs including the exotics. I daily chart the prices of 12 pairs and plan on looking at all of them for possible trades. I hope that others are open to this too. If you are new I understand why you would want to stick with cable and euro, but I encourage you to chart some of the exotics now so that you will have notes and a history of what some of the exotics do. The eur/cad, eur/aud, gpy/jpy, gpy/chf, and eur/jpy all move more than 90 pips a day on average. With that kind of movement, who cares about a 6-9 pip spread? I hope that this post can be like a live event where people are posting possible trades in real time so we can all make money. Or does the group want to set up a chat room for live trading? I'm just a participant in this forum throwing out ideas.

Here is version two of the template, please check to see if it is correct.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Ok, thanks. I can leave the computer on all day 24/7 but just can't watch it roughly from 9 AM to 5 PM and I get up at 6:30 AM.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Tnx for the update fxhermit, Re: "Here is version two of the template, please check to see if it is correct." I note there is no lsma in it. Is the lsma deleted now??

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I would think that your best trading times would be first thing in the morning. The euro session has been going on for 3-4 hours and a lot of times the daily trends are already established. What happens is that London opens, there can be some news within the first 2 hours, then the market will most times trend until the US session. There are tons of pips to be made during these times. My friend and I dream of going to the east coast for a month ( we are on the west coast) get up early and trade our brains out. And you are right there! You also can trade the asian session from 7:30-9pm. Each session has its own way of moving. I would paper trade and take notes for a while until you can understand them. The market will always be here.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I wanted everyone to look at the gbp/jpy and the eur/jpy pairs today at around 1 GMT. I was watching the pairs and then left my computer for a while and missed the move. Dollie's cross of the indicators was on the M15, M30 and H1. Before the move the pairs were not acting like the market knew which way to go so that caused me to think that nothing was going to happen for a while. Well I was wrong. After 1 GMT there was some good candles. The signal on the H1 was at 0 GMT and the M30 was at 0:30 GMT and at M15 at 1 GMT.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hey: You asked last week what times to trade. So I hope that you looked at the moves today and this morning. The gpy/chf moved 120+ and the cad pairs also were big because of the rate decision. That is why I say to look at all the pairs. I like to think this way: If we worked for one of the big players and institutions, your boss would want you to make money almost every day for the clients. So some pair is probably going to be moving a lot almost every day so that the big boys can make money.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Just sharing yesterday's nice moves on the GBP 4h First we look for Over sold signs ( green markings on the left showing both cci and rsi is O sold and trading under the 10 line ) So now we know a possible buy is coming up shortly and it does happen when pink and blue cross for a buy - now we know the trend direction after the cross - its a buy. Then the possible trade becomes a safer option when both cci and rsi are above 0. ( the white 2) It even becomes more safe when lsma enters ( the yellow markings ) I trade safely. I want to increase my account and not enter risky trades. I want to trade what I see thats why I like this indic of mine. When things lines up I take the trade with confidence. We stay in the trade till where I have drawn the red markings ..its shows now that its over bought and time to take profit. All 3 indic shows O bought in the 90 zone..a very good sign to take profit. Also note the red marking on the pink in the 10 zone...shows the end of the trend too. Now we know its O bought so we look for a possible sell trade next... When blue and pink cross its a sell - we know the trend now... then we wait for cci to enter down through 0 (white 3 ) ....now we know the trade is s afer as we trade now under 0. Soon after lsma enters through as well ( yellow markings) Now its even more safe . Marking 4 shows us where the down trend resumes Green markings shows where it went into O sold and a safe place to close the trade. Lsma is lagging when you wait for it to cross 0 ...but when that happens its safe. You can enter earlier when lsma enters in between pink and blue and make more pips. As long as for a buy the lsma is trading above 0 you should be fine and under 0 when its a sell trade..as seen in this chart. Hope this helps !

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I hope that there are going to be more people that participate in this forum. Dollie is a great teacher and has taught me a lot. Others can learn also so I hope we can make this a great forum.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks Dollie - your comments on the 4 hour trade were much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
i've been a quite observer on this thread.... nice set up on 4H i think i might try this method on demo 1st

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hello Dollie, thanks for the great indicator and sharing your method with us. The lessons are great. Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi Dollie, Thank-you for sharing. Got a question. Since I can only monitor the screen just a few hrs a day I'm looking for strategy that uses buy stop or sell stop for entry. Do you think buy stop/sell stop will work when rsi(2) runs into 10 or 90 level? eg. a 4hr bearish candle pushes rsi(2) into level 10 zone. I would do a buy stop at the high of the candle and put stop loss at the low of the candle. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hello Dollie What a great indicator you've developed! When I first glanced at this thread a couple weeks ago and saw all the overlapping lines of the indicator, my initial reaction was, Are you kidding? I returned to the thread last night and read the positive feedback and decided to download, study and backtest it. I was impressed. I typically trade the longer term charts, so I compared it to some of the indicators I use (Fozzy, Dynamic Zone RSI and 5,13,1 MACD). The thing that makes your indicator unique is that it has built in filters to keep you out of bad crossover signals and gives you at least a couple of possible entrys which lends itself to scaling into a trade. Thank you for sharing this with us. I plan to continue using it and may end up discarding some of the indicators I've been using because the Dollie Indicator appears to be a stand alone trading system.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Dollie, Thanks for sharing this great method and combination of indicators. I am going to test it in my micro account with great confidence from monday. .

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I'll be doing the same on EURUSD. good luck

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Indicator shows good consistency in live trading but don't forget that it cannot be backtested as the lines move around as you scroll back on the chart due to them all being on different scales.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Scorpion I was under the impression that backtesting was valid if entrys are made at the completion of a time frame as opposed to mid candle. Please set this newbie (me) straight since I spend much time backtesting various indicators over months trying to determine how they perform under differing market conditions. I dont want to waste my time if the results are not reliable. Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Sorry, I wasn't saying the results are not reliable, it looks like a good system but you can only forward test it. I wasn't talking about the mid or end of candle. If you open up a 30 minute chart with the indicators on then scroll back through the chart slowly you will see that the indicators move as the chart moves, so back testing would not be valid in this instance, you could only backtest if all 3 indicators were on the same scale which isn't possible. Its a good setup when traded live.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks for your point, I totally agree. In live trading, this indicator will work like magic and needs some practise.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Scopion I see what you are referring to. The RSI will move in relation to the 0 line (because the 0 line is belongs to the CCI). Thanks for enlightening me. ( I wasn't referring to wasting my time with this particular indicator but to backtesting systems that have one indicator overlayed another indicator ).

--- 帖子 #60 ---
This sounds very interesting and worth a try. Thank you for this kevin

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I am excited to see that there is more interest in Dollie's system and I see some great first posts. One thing I would like to see and what is already happening is everyone helping everyone else out. If you have looked at other posts, the "founder" after several weeks starts to get slammed with personal messages and e-mails and ends up doing nothing but answering questions and not trading. Then they have to leave for a while to clean out their e-mail. I don't think any of us want that to happen so all of us can help out. I recommend that everyone try the system out on paper for several weeks to get an understanding of how it works. Everyone can win here with all of our help and input. Let's teach each other and share ideas. Well They say that there’s a pie up in the sky; Waiting for me when I die; But between the day you’re born and when you die; they never seem to hear you when you cry; So as sure as the sun will shine; I’m going to get my share of what is mine…..

hi, any signals today?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yes, it is. unfortunate that I was at work, can't trade. http://img240.imageshack.us/img240/990/eurusdis1.gif

--- 帖子 #64 ---
thanks a lot i see it indeed, what time frame do you think its the best for intraday? or do you look in all timeframes for signals?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I only did back test on eurusd hr chart. need a bit of price action to go along. example today the signal was a hammer than can't clear daily open + rsi(2) bounce of ASH. Hope this help.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi All has anyone tried to set this up in oanda platform? Any help/comments will be much appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Blanca welcome to the group. what time zone are you in and what times are you available to trade? What pairs do you trade? I'd be glad to give you ideas.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Welcome! Is Oanda a meta 4 platform like interbankfx and fxdd? Sorry that I am not familiar with the trading platform but have heard of oanda. These charts are set up to run on a M4. If not, you could always open a demo account with interbankfx and set up the indicators. Try it on oanda and let us know. Your question will come up again in the future I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
not really today. I didn't see any good signals

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi tasse, oanda platform is mach different from MT4 platform, as far as I know. Also their price and spread maybe sometimes differ much from MT4 platform trade providers. Oanda is good for their low initial deposit requirement. (Their spread is very high in newstimes as well). Most (nearly all) forums concentrate on MT4. There are many MT4 platform dealers with micro account facility. You may be able to set up this indicators (if they are available in Oanda platform) seperately (in seperate windows) in Oanda platform and try to learn entry point according to the rules.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
As far as I can see, this nice strategy from Dollie works better in 1H or bigger timeframe (maybe each of us can tweak the settings ourselves). Every trading day will bring very nice entrypoints if everyone train their eyes to pinpoint them. Today, long signalled at 3am GMT candle. Way better than a paid signal service. Thanks Dollie to this wonderful thread and I hope everyone make use of it and post comments to improve it (already seems good anyway).

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Wanted to share what I learned today. When the pink line on dollie is running flat on the bottom or top of the chart, that means that the trend is continuing. If the pink line moves at a good steep angle after it has been flat, then the trend is changing

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks, really good to know.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
hi, i can trade any time in london or ny session, thanks.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi, i am not sure but i think i am watching a signal in 30mins cable, a long at 1.9927, the same situation in euro, could any one confirm it please.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
another long cable 1.9937 trying to reach resistance at 1.9958 anyone could please confirm it?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
similar signal, just like yesterday. price can't clear daily open + rsi(2) bounce of AZH. http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/5789/eurusdwn6.gif

--- 帖子 #78 ---
thanks a lot jack, could you please show us usdjpy 1hr and usdchf 1hr it seems its the same entry.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
can't. sorry. I only concentrate on eurusd.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Blanca: You analysis on this move and the one last night were correct. the morning move started around 11:45 GMT and went past the resistance and reversed. There was a good signal on cable for that reverse also (not as perfect as I would like). By seeing this move on the 30min and 15min only, you can assume that the move is for 20+ and is not a huge one. Great take profit right around the resistance area.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
With the ISM news this morning, I was focused on the pound and euro. Missed the jpy pairs big time. Dollie showed up on the H1, M30, and M15 so you know it was going to be a good mover. eur/jpy was the weakest of the group. H1 showed up at 13 GMT starting to go long (blue and dotted white lines) and the move happened an hour later. Don't necessarily get in when the blue and white lines move, just know that something is coming and you can time your entry with the smaller charts. 50+ pips on gbp/jpy and 30+ on usd/jpy.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi pip pirate 2, please post some chart. It's easier to understand. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hello Dollie, I am using your indicator and so far it's working well for me. At first I have found all the lines confusing, but it is getting faster and faster to spot the trades. Thanks again for the indicator. How long did it take you to develop it? It is so nice of you to share it with us at no cost after all the hard work done by you. I have some questions for you. You are not talking much about the MAs - to what degree do you use them? When the cross of blue and pink line for buy occurs close to 90, or for sell close to 10 - do you enter the trade? What stop loss do you use? Thanks for your reply. Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #84 ---
So now for some confession. I don't know how to post charts on this forum. I can cut and paste, print screen for my own word documents but have not been able to figure out how to post. Teach me how to get the clean ones like you do. thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Im no expert but the simplest way I've found is to right click on the chart you want and click on "save as a picture". From there save it where you want and upload it. You can even save it a little smaller (I like to save it at about 700 x 500 pixels). Good luck, Pete

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks quinn. I have tried that and I get a small chart on a big page. It isn't very clear. I have done that and now can't copy and paste it to this forum

Many thanks for everyone's kind words ! I was experimenting a bit with overlaying different indic's that I like and to declutter my charts a bit and this one is the best I could come up with ! I am still hoping some of you guru's on here, can help me make this indic even better :-) So any suggestions is gladly welcomed. I like to know what the current trend is and that is why I keep those MA's around,,, as I always trade with the trend. Its so much easier and less stressful to be with the trend eg the direction in which it will most likely move the most. Stoplosses I keep tight ... I am blessed to have on avgre 3 out of 4 trades result in profit,,, so I am not into taking big losses and hanging onto losing trades for a long time. A losing trade ties up my money big time and I cant use it for other good trading opportunities I see in the mean time. For GBP that I trade the most, I have a 30 stop loss. Protecting my money is key for me, there will always be every day good safe trading opportunities as long as you have money to trade with :-) I also use the 400 : 1 ratio with no problems as it ties up less of my money at any given time and more of my money can 'work' for me. When pink and blue crosses near the 10 Over sold line you can still take the trade, but then remember that the indic is already showing that we are nearing an O sold situation ... so dont be greedy in expecting a whole lot of pips,,, be then satisfied with only a few and keep a close watch on when the trend will change. The abslute strength indic someone was so kind to simplify the indic for me. I gladly share it with you guys..as it is now, it will only show the pink line and a blue dotted line..in the original indic the cross of this pink and blue line was the signal that the trend is changing. You are welcome to still make this blue dotted line black or ... if the chart is not tooo cluttered by now.. keep it around and look for the odd time when this pink and blue dotted line cross for a trend change before pink and the other blue line shows the trend change. Here is a daily chart showing the improved Absolute strength indic ( before I added all the over lays) Its also a big help now when you want to print out charts it does not show up on printed charts as a histogram anymore. Happy trading !

HelloDollie Having all those indicators in that Window is scary. Just as long it makes PIPs....

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Pip pirate, I use a freeware program called irfanview, its just used to save the chart. Download it from here http://www.techspot.com/download299.html , or just search on google, install it and open it. Open this program and copy your chart from MT into it, then save it as a jpeg file, then you can attach it to your posts. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you for your help. I have done that, loaded it into irfanview, and then copy it. When I go to FF to try to paste it, the paste button is grey and doesn't let me paste it. We are getting closer! Thanks again. Okay I have it figured out! Yea. So I will be posting charts in the future

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Once you have loaded the chart into infanview don't copy it, but save it as a file somewhere on your computer, I normally do it to the desktop, then once you have saved it as a file, when you write your message here before hitting submit reply scroll down and you will see a section called "additional options" hit the manage attachements button, click on browse button, find your saved chart and click upload. Once the file shows as uploaded you can close that window, then hit submit reply and your done. When you initially save the chart from MT by rightclicking and choosing save as picture, make sure that you have the size correct, I think the forum accepts 700 x 1000 as the biggest. Hope this helps

Hi Pip Private 2, After you've the picture files do the followings. 1. click the Manage Attachments button to open the Manage Attachments page. 2. click browse to select the picture file in you C drive. 3. click upload to upload the picture file. 4. click close this windows button to close the Manage Attachments page. jackt

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thanks to everyone for your help with the charts. I will now be able to post them with some comments. What I really want to show is what the indicators looked like before the move

--- 帖子 #94 ---
hi, it seems today we had signals in 1hr timeframe in cable for +20, eurjpy for +45 and still running usdjpy for +25 and eurusd for around 10 pips and still running, all of them its curious but all are sell signals. One small question which timeframe do you think its better for intraday use, 30min or 1hr?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
1hr timeframe is the best fit to this strategy (specially if you are a daytrader), in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Blanca: Megapips is right. Dollie likes and trades using the H1 chart. It is not as reliable on the M15, is okay on the M30 but the longer time frames are the best. Is excellent on the daily charts. Look at the daily charts with the gbp/chf and you can see many opportunities spelled out.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
thanks a lot i`ll be forward testing it with 1hr, the dolly indicator is indeed impressive how it can goes with the trend and a reliable exit. thanks a lot dolly.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Here is the gbp/jpy chart. Not perfect but still good signals. There were two good opportunities to go short, one last night and one this morning. On the far left of the chart, you see the dotted line going short with good angle, Pink line going up and all of them crossing including the blue line. The lmsa line is yellow to red telling you there is a change coming. The second move had the dotted line bouncing around so don't do anything yet. Then lsma goes short (red), pink is long and stronger, blue makes the cross. I like the blue line in most situations ( in a short trade) to be at the top of the chart and then going down. Notice also that the macd chart was flat before this move. That tells me that something might be ready to happen.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Here's a chart. look at dollie on the gby/jpy long on june 7, 1 GMT on the H1. Also the eur/jpy on the H1. Only ran 100+ pips in 5 hours. That's why I look at the exotics. Was surprised that it ran that much. Be not afraid of going slowly: Be afraid only of standing still Chinese Proverb

--- 帖子 #100 ---
hi good morning, impressive trades today, in cable around 38 pips and running, gbpjpy is like 80 pips, etc but also gbpjpy and eurjpy are giving short signals right now +27 and +16 only those last two i was able to catch, i arrived late today i forgot to set my alarm clock.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
i closed both trades gbpjpy +70, it might keep going down but i am already happy, and eurjpy with +12, cable today gave a very big rally almost 100 pips, also look at usdchf 50 pips very good day even for the ones who arrived late.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
cool. please post some chart.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Very nice trades everyday, if anyone made any furthur development for this method, please do some posts. I always trade breakout with hans123 system for very long time, so I use this system as an additional confirmation before any possible breakout. But, I like to see furthur modifications combined with this system.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Here's a chart from the overnight move that Blanca caught. Notice that the cross was on the first down candle letting you know something big was happening. What I have found is the bigger the time frame for a great cross, the bigger the move. The dotted line is very strong. Lmsa is already red saying short. the pink line is coming up strong. Remember the goal is to see this, can use smaller charts to time entry, make trade and get to breakeven and let the trade go.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Mega: Did you check out Dollie's post at #87?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Yes pip pirate, that is better as well, but I prefer adx filter to confirm as you are using in your setups. I am sure there will be much much more developements will happen to this strategy. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
PP2 This is a very interesting approach: I'm trying to follow your trades but I can't get the rules straight i.e. "Lmsa is already red saying short" Is there a post that I can refer to for the long/short rules. I thought Iread them all. In addition,would it be possible to indicate the entry positions on your chart with a circle on the indicator so that I can see what an entry looks like. Thanks for sharing this interesting approach.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi, Dollie and everyone. Thanks a lot for sharing this system. I am a newbie to forex and just demo trading for two week. I think I am doing OK but obviouly sometimes don't know what I am doing. I spent a lot of time to read the forums and try to find a system that can work for me--so time-consuming and it makes me dizzy often. Anyway, I just stumbled on this tread the other day and so far I like the Dollie system and will try to stick with it. Here are the chart I spotted today. Please give me some advice: So it is a signal, right? Then How can I decide the T/P and S/L? When should I exit? I wish there is a EA for this method because I am pretty much occupied and can sit all day to watch the screen Happy Trading! Hapipips

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Hapipips, I can see you are exited about forex, true, everyone is. But, please do not take me wrong - never ever think there will be or is an Expert Advisor which will give continious wins and you come back home to take all profits. If you find an EA as such, please post to us. So, the only way to survive in trading is mechanical methods. Everyone always ask for EA for every method, I do not think an EA is likely to be developed for this method - this is what I like about this method. Traders learn everyday for new strategies, there is or maybe not any such system to make money itself and we do not want to monitor it. Anyway, Good Luck in your tradings. Regards.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I just wanted to post a note here because it has been mentioned that you can't backtest this method because the relative height of the lines changes over time. Well, that's not really true. You CAN backtest this. This is what you do. Put your Dollie setup on a pair and then move to the very beginning of the timeline (in MT4, just hit "Home" and it will take you to the beginning of the timeline). Once you're there, hit F12. This will step you through the bars/candlesticks one at a time. By doing this, you can actually see the crosses exactly as they would have been seen in the past. Based on the rules, make a trading decision (don't peek ahead!) and then hit F12 again to see how the trade would have played out. It's time consuming, but this will allow you to manually backtest this method if you care to.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks Bytebodger, never knew this before. Really appereciated. Will do.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Fantastic Bytebodger, where did you learn this, no one told me before. Nice trick.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I read this a few days ago in the Metatrader forum on this site. Also, Shift+F12 goes backward one bar.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks Bytebodger.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Does anyone see a long set up approaching on the cable (30 min TF) Thanks, Kunz

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Excited? Maybe. A lot more of nervous actually. I will not open a live account until I am fully comfortable. Not that I want to find a easy way to do forex, but if there is one why not give it a try. I am actually studying very hard and lost some sleep. I know I am making progress but still very caucious about really moving forward to live trading. And when I start live trade, I will try my best to monitor the trades as much as possible even when a EA is doing the trade for me. Thank you for your comments anyways.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Wow! Thank you so much! And the backtest results are fantastic on EUR/USD 1H chart!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thank you. This long setup will not be a major one, it will be followed by a short very soon, in my opinion - unless this long setup continues into bigger timeframes.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
As much as I like this system. I really want to know what is behind all those indicators? I know RSI but not ASI, CCI, LSMA. And what about the settings--why we set it up that way? I just want to learn more than just copying superficially. Where can I learn more about all those technical tools to analyze the chart? Can anyone kindly answer my question? Really appreciate everything. Happy trading to everyone! A hungery newbie

--- 帖子 #120 ---
my general rule (at the moment) for hr eurusd: S/L - 10-20 pips T/P - average daily range. at the moment I use 60 pips. Hope this help.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thanks Jay Jay and all the other people posting: In my opinon, what these indicators tell you is that a move has the potential to happen soon. It depends on what the time frame is as to how soon the move is might happen. I have seen a cross on the H4 during the asian session and the actual move happen 4 hours later. What is important to me as I look at many pairs is which one might make a move soon? This indicator works best on the longer time frames but if you test it it may work on shorter times. Just realize that the smaller time frames can give you smaller pip totals. Most of the questions asked will be answered with more paper trading. I have been seriously studying this for over 3 weeks with all sessions and am starting to get a handle on it. Please take the time to paper trade and chart your results. I would not have entered on a H1 chart necessarily. Sometimes I moved to a smaller chart to time the entries. I look for the dotted line to be moving at a good angle, the blue line following, the pink line moving in the opposite direction and lsma further confirming the move. this isn't the only indicator to use. Please understand that those wanting very specific entries could be considered giving financial advice and I personally am not going to do that as I am not licensed to do it. I am not giving any buy, sell, or hold recommendations. The market will be here forever so you will understand the system with a little time.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Yes I use a ADX 13 filter also as was shared with me from Dollie. There could be more developments in the future.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
My two cents as someone who has lost thousands of dollars learning how to trade is to paper trade for many months. Read books, study and learn from others. Then open a small account with a broker that does micro lots where you are trading less than a dollar. then slowly increase your investments. Make a trade journal. Live trading too early and potentially losing money can mess up your thinking so bad it can set you back. That is what happened to me. Remember that you are a freshman in college and you will do fine. Welcome aboard.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi, good morning to all, the recommendations pip gave you could not be better, study books, there are many free ebooks available, first paper trade and then start small in a mini account, that will give u confidence another one is discipline, always follow your plan. About today trades i see shorts in gbpusd, eurjpy , usdjpy and gbpjpy each one for +12, +20,+14 and +48, gbpjpy is the one with more move today.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Final results, i did my exit basicly because all of them are hitting a support and the moves were already strong considering yesterday`s activity, even though the lsma is still red. gbpjpy +133, eurjpy +60 ,gbpusd +56, usdjpy +18, all of them still have red the lsma but those pips are good enough for me.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi there all ! I wanted to just post that i used to use the Fozzy and now have been using the Dollie and loving it, im on a live account and its doing wonders for adding to my thoughts on when to enter and bail from a trade. I would also like to post that i came home tonight and spent an hour making dinner, in that hour the pairs that ive been waiting for USD/CAD, EURUSD and the USDCHF all went nuts. I knew it was coming and i knew around about when but i forgot, all because of my stomach....thankyou for reading my complaint and i will now return to the fetal position on my bedroom floor. THanks again Dollie and thanks to Pip Pirate also for keeping the thread alive =0).

--- 帖子 #127 ---
hi, one last trade gave us usdjpy a long at 121.30 1hr chart, still running green at 121.71 , +40 pips profit, like yesterday a very good day.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
i forgot to post euro short today 1.3429 and exit at 1.3350 +79 pips, but this one i did not do it, too many signals at the same time.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I am real happy that some of you are seeing the light with dear Dollie and making a few pips ! Such good news to me :-) Here is the daily GBP chart : I have added adx setting 2 and overlayed lsma over it and also a stochastic ( to give us the 90 and the 10 lines ) White #1 : Here we see that the trend is up .. so we know we should be looking for a possible buy opportunity. Why? Because Dollie blue and pink has crossed with blue above pink, which means buy and the white dotted line is trading inbetween pink and blue. ( Not to confuse anyone the dotted blue line is part of absolute strenght indic ... if here are too many lines black out that one it will make it easier for you to follow ) Now it becomes even safer where I have drawn the white circles. On adx when our lsma is inbetween pink and blue its safe to trade.. you will almost always make a few pips when this set up occurs. You can also see that lsma is also in between pink and blue on Dollie... normally very safe too. Possible exit strategies : - The move is over when lsma goes out of the blue line on ADX and when Dollie shows Over bought ( Dollie thick blue line and white dotted line goes into 90 area ) White # 2: Same story here pink and blue has crossed for a sell ...adx has crossed for a sell as well and our MA's has crossed as well. When does it become really safe to make a few pips? Where you see the white circles ..that is when lsma goes inbetween on Dollie and on ADX. Here the sell trade was very safe. Why ? - Pink has crossed blue for a sell - Dotted white line ( cci6) is trading under 0 - lsma is trading under 0 - lsma is inbetween blue and pink When to stay away ? We cannot trade all the time .. there are many times when you want to stay away from a certain pair. We need to know when its not safe to trade eg when the market is sideways and in consolidation mode. Dollie shows us a bit of that as well. Have a look at Red # 3: When lsma trades above blue and pink its not very safe... then I stay away and look for other pairs with a more favourable set up for making safe pips. I use ADX 13 with stoch's overlayed at levels 90 and 10 to show me Oversold and Over bought situations. ADX 13 shows it better than ADX 2. You are welcome to overlay ADX 13 with stoch's for the 90 and the 10 dotted lines. ADX2 is good for showing us quickly the trend ( just a confirmation ) And I keep ADX 2 around for the set up where lsma goes inbetween pink and blue. Hope this helps someone !

--- 帖子 #130 ---
HelloDollie, Thanks for the explanation. I understand the approch better. One additional question, In your first post you mention that the 30min and h1 works for you. Does that still hold. I notice that the charts differ from each Time Frame. Are you now mainly using the DailyTF? Thanks for your response...jj/.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I trade it succesfully off the 1h mainly .. although in busy trading times ... the 30 mins works many a time per day well too. I use longer time frame charts here to try and explain how I read the indic because on longer tf charts we can see the moves so much beter where as a 30 min chart can be very jumpy and confusing to someone who wants to understand and learn how this indic works. Good luck ! Make lots !

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Thank you for sharing your system. I would like to ask you; are you trading this system on a live account? how long have you traded this system and how many pips on average do you make per week? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Dollie thank you and others who have contributed to this thread. I am always on the lookout for useful indicators. I noticed that you indicate that your success rate is about 75%. Is that percentage trading off the 1 hr chart? Has there been any effort to review the 25% that didn't work to see what caused the failures? Do you trade other currencies besides the GBP with this setup? And do you have any ball park estimates of pips captured per week or month? Cheers.. Virgil

--- 帖子 #134 ---
hi dollie, been following your thread. starting to get confused(not hard for me). could you please post your most recent template so i can catch up a bit? thank you.............vince

From Billy Glyde about Anger "I would also like to post that i came home tonight and spent an hour making dinner, in that hour the pairs that ive been waiting for USD/CAD, EURUSD and the USDCHF all went nuts. I knew it was coming and i knew around about when but i forgot, all because of my stomach....thankyou for reading my complaint and i will now return to the fetal position on my bedroom floor." Boy can I relate to that! If you use Interbankfx or FXDD (or simply set up a demo account with them) you can use price alarms that you customize and set. That way you can walk away from the computer and it will tell you with an alarm if the pair has moved. Everyone can use them as it keeps you from staring at the screen all the time

--- 帖子 #136 ---
good morning, i am sick today so i could only take a few hours ago a long eurjpy at 162.39 it s still running but i already closed it as i dont feel very well, i have a terrible flu, and headache, but i hope tommorrow i can post some charts to see entries and exits. bye.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hello Blanca, I have been following this thread and have tested this system. It looks promising. Looking forward to your chart postings. Thanks for posting your progress using this system.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Maybe not the clearist charts but I wanted to post them anyway. The gbp/chf has been channelling for a while and with cable news this week it is not surprising that it can make a move. You will see two charts. The daily is telling us that we need to pay attention that a move is probably coming soon. The blue line is going long strong. The dotted line is closely following. the thick pink line is going south strong and the lsma is turning from yellow to green. If you got in on the third candle from the right, the short white one, you would be up over 80 pips as of now.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Now here is a H4 chart which you would use to time your entry. Can even go down to a H1 or M30

--- 帖子 #140 ---
PP2, in addition the regular thick pink line, I see there is a thin Pink line as well, which I do not have on my indicator. Could you please clarify! Thanks.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
today`s results did not take anyone as i am still sick just came this morning to see how it went, gbpusd -9 pips eurusd +12 pips usdchf +16 pips usdjpy +7 pips eurjpy -20 pips gbpjpy +13 pips. not bad, not so good either.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
In the attached chart, at the "Orange Tick Mark" in the indicator area, where the Blue line is crossing the thick pink line, the lines are not really in the OverSold zones...they are between 0 and -100. Would you still take this trade OR should a trade be taken only in the O-Bought / O-Sold zones. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
15min charts are difficult for this system to take the trades, i find easier the 1hr charts, like right now, look at eurjpy 1hr we have one trade running short at 162.45, lets see when it exits. Just exited at 162.07 there is a support there and i thought would be a good exit, but the lsma is still red so its still running, i closed it also because i still dont feel very well. see u tommorrow.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
To answer both of your questions: The little pink line is a CCI 6. I would have taken that euro trade. Remember that it is on the 15 min time frame so the amount of potential pips is less. Dollie doesn't usually trade that small but I have been testing it and have liked it. Sometimes with the smaller time frames there can be false signals. Your candles and macd also confirmed. Use Dollie with other indicators for the best confirmations.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
You are correct as usual. For those who don't know Blanca, we knew her from another thread and she is awesome. She makes the pips and has the experience. We welcome you to "Team Dollie" and look forward to your valuable input in making this thread even better. Please get well soon. As a side note to my post on the gbp/chf last night, you would be up 180 pips. I'm paper trading longer term trades and learning like everyone else.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
What indicators would you recommend for confiming clear ENTRY and EXIT points and avoiding false signals?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
You can use for exits specially the adx dolly recommended it is nothing more than precise for it, the entries the dolly indicator is the best, you`ll notice at the end both match, pip you are an awesome trader too, we can notice in your posts and dollie what can we say, the indicator shared has a lot of experience behind, not only filters the bad signals, but takes the strong ones with a nice exit, thanks again. Whoever took the gbpchf long, god bless him, he might be travelling to hawaii right now, lol with all those pips

--- 帖子 #148 ---
good morning, feeling much better today, let me tell u the entries gbpusd short 19718, exit 1.9691 usdjpy long 121.77, exit 120.30 eurusd long 1.3301 exit 1.3296 and short 132.90 exit 132.78 eurjpy long 161.99 exit 162.42 gbpjpy 240.58 exit 241.02 only one small loss in euro today. the rest excellent, still news ahed in ny lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Awww blanca, I thought i had been following this thread but it would seem i missed the part on how to pick your exits grrr...re-read time! I learns good like =0D I love that you are posting your entry's and exit's but when i see someone telling me to jump in and out at certain times i never do it with my money because it feels like im cheating and since i ( except for forex learning ) am easily, lulled into laziness, i just demo the posted info and really pull it to bits and see what makes it tick! It really helps, thanks gang! P.S Are you sure you were sick and it wasnt just your girl germs playing up, cause girls have girl germs as we all know =0P

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Sorry bout the double post but i would like to thank and not thank lol, pip pirate for telling me about alarms, i use MT4 and it has that function but its killing me trying to make the darn thing DO AS I SAY!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I have so much to say with these two posts but will be brief. Billy as some friendly advice you might want to work on positive thinking. 90% of trading is mental. This forum in my opinion should be one that helps all to get better. If you have a need, many will help. Laziness will get you in this business. I have a saying on my wall to remind me that "Discipline = Freedom". The alarms on MT4 are not hard to work. Open a micro account and trade $1 at a time. Practice , patience, and focus on what you want not what you don't want to happen. I know this from personal experience as we fight our own demons.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
today only two trades.- long usdjpy 122.76 and still open then short gbpusd 1.9700 closed 1.9690, that is all, kind of boring london session, lets see ny how it moves.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
another one eurusd long at 1.3304 exit 1.3300, loss of -4 plus spread. And short gbpusd 1.9675, still running. Final exit for cable short 1.9687 - 12 pips plus spread, seems ny is also not moving much. see u tommorrow.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I think you took what i said the wrong way, i was just saying that its great that people post their trades ahead of time so as i can see whats going on as it happens in demo but i have met some people that look for others posts and such, that have had a good track record on trading and simply trade on that without knowing how or why the trade worked ( or did not work ), i do the same thing but insted of just placing orders on other good traders posts, i like to take that information and watch those trades as they happen and try to figure out how and why so i learn better insted of just following along. Then if i understand how it all works and it seems viable i then trade live with that information. I know i may type in a fairly childish way lol, but i have been really pushing through and studying forex for about 7 months now. I have had a live account for about 3 months. But i know this is for me simply because i have spent time kneeling on the floor holding my head asking the gods "WHY?!" and others telling me to give it up but i have kept going...hence me saying i am known for laziness except when the forex is concered, it would seem..YAY! Oh, pip, you pirate you, do you know if MT4 sends sms's, thats what ive been trying to figure out, i had it send email to a yahoo ( thanks for telling me it could do that ) address and then yahoo would sms me but the yahoo sms is newish and keeps breaking. So i was hoping that you or someone else might know if MT4 can send sms direct to my phone. My posts are to long =0(

This is no buy, sell or hold recommendation. This is for training purposes only. I want you look at all the euro pairs and see what do you think is going to happen. Many people don't pay attention to the exotics but here is a good reason to at least look at them. Look at the eur/gbp, eur/jpy, eur/chf, eur/aud and to some degree the eur/cad on the daily charts. What is in common with those and how they look? The euro is going long and is building strength. What pair have I left out? That's right: eur/usd. It is flat on the daily chart. So what is possible to happen with the euro? Ding. Yes Pip Hunters you get a prize if you said it should go long. I'm not talking about a few pips but a good mover. We will wait and see. It is important to see what pair is the driver and passenger. Who is driving the cross? The euro is the driver.

Another trade long eurjpy 164.07, still open I saw +70 pips in gbpjpy and could not resist the temptation to close it. but left usdjpy open it is up +30, i`ll close it by the rules this one, this happens to me sometimes, i see very good pips and a small devil whispers, close it, close it. sorry for that, hope it wont happen again.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
closed usdjpy at 123.45 profit of +33 pips, the gbpjpy went up after my close 35 pips, so was not a good idea an early exit:surprised , anyway eurjpy is still running with a profit of +65 pips, during the news cable gave a long signal but i usually dont trade the news that quickly, and today is a full of news session in ny. so total so far for today gbpjpy +70 usdjpy +33 eurjpy +65 = 168 pips but i made a mistake by exiting early, missed 35 pips.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Blanka, Thanks for all your updates of everyday signals. I just want to confirm few things you personally could suggest with this method. 1. Do you use 1H timeframe as your main entry view? 2. Do you use any very smaller timeframes to exactly pinpoint your real entry? 3. Do you use any stoploss, or let the trade run till exit signal points that? 4. As this method mainly depends on visual decision for entries, I will really appreciate if you post one or two entry point you have made with snapshots. 5. Also, yesterday, you had a losing entry (with very small loss anyway). Will you please explain, why was the entry? why did you exit? etc. with chart, if possible. This will really help so many of us to learn your consistency. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
sure mega, i use a 30 pip stoploss always, never trade without it, lol. the exit i dont use smaller timeframes because they tend to change every now and then and finally i can get confused. so when the signal in the 1hr appears to exit i do it. i use a 1hr chart in currencies like cable, euro, yen, gbpjpy, eurjpy they move a lot. Yesterday the small losses were due to the lack of move, when a day like that happens, 1hr has small losses, that happens in any system, i will post charts tommorrow because even though i am trading still dont feel so well, some headaches during the day, but you can start searching yesterdays trades when you see signals in 1hr, then they loose. that is all. One observation about cable during the news.- Watch how most of the way it went up during the news is already coming down, news are always unpredictible and still is missing the consumer sentiment today, so i`ll just watch and enjoy the fireworks.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Thanks blanca, really appreciate it. I always tend to peek through smaller timeframes when I place an entry, that really confuses me about the direction of the trend, now I realise entry on a fixed timeframe is far better. Thanks and looking forward to your contribution as always.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Final exit of eurjpy +86 pips, so total for today 186 pips Cable and euro in ny session gave two long signals good for around 40 pips each

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Considering other so many strategies, I can see this method outstands well to give much more pips each day according to blanca's trades. If everyone is as much accurate as blanca, no doubt trading will be a joy.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I am unable to overlay the indicators in a single window. Can anybody help plz or post a correct template. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Here is the template, you need to have all the indicators (in the very 1st post), in metatrader indicator file anyway. This template works fine now.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
just read thru d thread, looks very promising. thumps up 2 every1. i think i understand the system but im not 2 sure cos i have not traded it b4. please blanca since u r getting very gud results culd u post some of ur charts so we can understand it better n view it from your own perspective. what do u do when a major news is coming n u r already in a trade? do u close d trade before the news or u set a tight stop loss n c where it goes from there? also is any1 using the modified adx2 filter dollie posted? if u r, culd u please post the template. also, mayb i missed it, but do u trade on candle close i.e enter or exit at open of next candle after signal or u just hit the market order imediately u c a signal. please confirm thanks again

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I have esignal and I was wondering if there was an equivalent to the absolute strength indicator because they don't appear to have one. Or, where I could download the indicator?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Blanca, do your trades go over a day or two or is you Entry and Exit the same day.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thanks a lot mate. But I think the LSMA is missing there.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
You will find the indicator on post #87. Good luck

--- 帖子 #171 ---
The ADX indicator is part of your meta 4 trading platform. I can't open my platform now that the market is closed but it is at the top I believe under insert. then change the initial setting to 2. I have just started to use it. It is a very fast indicator that needs some time to study it. As we always say here, paper trade this system for a while to understand it. If you go thru all the posts you will see enough examples of what dollie's indicators are supposed to look like before a trade. Entry and exit timing are a fine art and you will learn your method with practice. Sometimes you wait for the candle to finish but most of the time you just know it's time to get in or out.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You'll find the LSMA indicator on post #1

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I have the lsma but how to place it on the same window of other indicators? It is opening up in a separate window.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi, Try this template, sure this will be fine.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
thanks for the reply. pls what do u do before, during or after a major news event with this system?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Yeah this is just perfect. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Ah, what do you do? That is a good question and I don't mean to make fun of it. Personally I don't play news events right as they happen any more. I've lost too much money. Spreads from brokers get wide and getting filled is a crap shoot. I now look for the trend many hours before the news and see if it is worth it to enter the trade with the trend. Then you can set your stops at break even if you are up enough or a small potential loss. Depending on the pair and the news event, you can then come out ahead or small loss. If you are right you do really well. It is interesting if you have noticed that many times the market has decided which way it wants to go regardless of the data. If the trend ( say on a daily or H4 chart) is strong, at some time after the news the trend will likely resume. So my strategy is either get in hours before or wait until the dust settles and then get in. I encourage everyone to take notes and charts of what the pairs do several days before a big event and see if there is a trend developing ahead of the news. I am starting to believe that the smart people make their money before the event and close their trade right before the news. Look at the pound pairs last week. Last week is filled with gbp news and the gbp/jpy moves 500 pips and the gbp/chf moves 250. The euro moved 80 pips like I said it might also.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
thanks pippirate for your reply. today the the 1st time im oberserving the dollie live n i need some help concerning the candles. i am using the 1hr chart n i discovered that the indicator in 1 moment can give a long signal n within the twinkle of an eye it gives u a short signal within the same candle. so how do u now make ur decisions before candle closes. attached is an example below: the chart is gj 1hr. about 32mins to the close of the candle it gives an exit signal n in the second chart the same candle about 28mins to the close of the same candle it says to stay inthe trade! n i think it is even possible for it to give a short signal before the same candle closes! pls how do u manage this. or is it that when u talk of not waiting for a canle to close, u mean maybe about some few mins e.g. 5 or few seconds befor candle closes when there is an established trend? pls blanca i would appreciate ur opinion on this since it seems u r making consistent pips with the system. thanks again

--- 帖子 #179 ---
this is the same chart n same candle!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
In fact it only showed a long signal in gbpjpy 1hr, the key is to look at the lsma green between the blue and red lines, try to use the adx 2 in order to keep the trade safe, it is the cross of blue and red which tells if its a sell or a buy signal. We had long signals in gbpjpy , gbpusd +45 and +40 each one.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
seems uj is about to go short. what is ur take on this blanca? blanca do u use 1hr chart for ur entrys only n do u wait for the 1hr candle to close b4 entering. would help if u culd post some charts. thanks again

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi, in usdjpy still we dont have the lsma red between the two lines, so better wait for everything to be online always, i dont wait for close, just look for a safe entry, not early, the adx will help you to see the right entry and exit , also when the lsma goes inside is a nice way to see it, i`ll post charts later today in ny right now it is 3 am here so i am half sleep, half awake, lol.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi, here is the gbpjpy long signal we had today in the morning, check how the lsma in green keeps you in the trade until the exit, +42 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi blanca, please repost your chart as an attachment. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
My two cents. I like this dollie pattern. the blue line and dotted are close together and going short at a good sharp angle. Notice how the blue line is moving short one candle before the next candle actually goes short? That's a warning sign saying something "Might" happen. Then a strong pink line and cross. With the cross of blue and pink below the 0 line tho, the move may not go on for a large pip count. Also pay attention to the candles and what they say. There are three candles before the short candle that say "indecision" spining tops. It is important to understand your times of day and when the moves are most likely to be good with the indicators. this chart as a the open of the london session so that is good also. If it occured at 19 GMT in the dead zone, I wouldn't be excited.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Please have a look at this g/u 1 hr chart. Is it a perfect entry to go LONG? Help please. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hello Blanca, did you enter long on this USDJPY pair when the LSMA turned GREEN and came between both the BLUE and PINK lines, and exited the trade when the LSMA turned YELLOW at the top and the BLUE line crossed LSMA in the downward direction? Just trying to clarify for my understanding. Also, it seems that it is much more safe to enter when the LSMA is between the BLUE and PINK lines? Please correct me if I am wrong and/or make suggestions. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
In my opinion the answer is yes to the entry at the end of your chart. This brings up several issues. One is now that I am looking back at what happen to your entry if you would have taken it, we find that 9 hours later you would have been up around 20 pips. Not huge. But the lesson is if you want to make the trade with the "proper" signals, get in and as soon as it is right, set yourself to break even after the pair has moved some. I will not be specific here because it is a matter of individual choice. That way you can't lose. Sometimes you will make a few pips, sometimes big, and sometimes nothing. but also notice that at that time of day, 15 GMT, the market is slowing down so you can't expect big numbers. Second is the fact on that chart that Dollie did not show the early move long. Folks sometimes it just doesn't work. that is why you need to use it along with other indicators. I love the energy of this forum with great questions and people really trying to get better.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yes akhan, i took exactly that entry and exactly that exit, i also do as pip says, move to breakeven once we can do it and it happens as he says, sometimes hits us in zero, but many times runs. Today still no signal, maybe in ny after the news.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hey everybody, I was wondering if you take signals that are created due to a news release or is there a period of time you wait to take a signal after a news release. Thanks for all your help. Be Blessed.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
everything depends, i usually try not to trade the news, sometimes can be very dangerous, but for example today. We got signal today early in london for short eurjpy so i hold my stoploss tight right before the news and sometimes goes in my favour like today, sometimes it takes me out, also if i see that the news generate a clear signal, and if they dont move up and down like a yoyo then i take it too, but in my opinion is better to take the moves before them, ny news specially on fridays are surprising. ah signal today short eurjpy 165.60, still open usdjpy short 123.52

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I understand that this indicator is best used on higher time frames, but i was wondering what time frames do most of you use. The reason why i am asking is because i would prefer if i could use the 4 Hour timeframe but i am unsure if people have been successful trading the 4 Hour timeframe, because it seems like the majority of traders here are trading the 1 Hour timeframe. Also, I was wondering if it is a good idea to enter in a trade based off of the 1 Hour time frame and then use the 4 Hour time frame for a exit or is it best just to enter and exit on the same time frame. Thanks. God Bless P.S. Sorry if this message is long its just that i am really enthused about this particular strategy and really want to get a firm grasp on it. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
both trades were closed with +10 and +10 then did an euro long for +12

Thanks. God Bless You are always welcome and the more the merrier. Personally I have not used this with the H4 but I don't see why not. I would watch for what time of day and what pair you are trading to make sure you have the best chance of success. Just make sure you are not going into a dead period of the market. You are going to have to paper trade your methods for a while to see about the timing of entry and exit. Also make sure your stop loss is big enough to go through the ups and downs ( and only you can determine what amount that is).I am even more excited about using the daily charts for those moves that happen once or twice a month but for 100+ pips. The gbp/jpy in 8 days went 500+ .

--- 帖子 #195 ---
today all jpy pairs gave short signals, but after 2hrs all of them turned around, so all of them in zero, lol. lets see if cable later give us a good signal.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
cable long at 1.9890 still open +30 gbpjpy long at 245.48 still open +65 then later usdjpy long 123.40 still open +10 eurjpy long 165.77 still open +9 Even today at the beginning we had this tricky move the cable news in london gave finally some good moves specially gbpjpy.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
---- Blanca, are you pin pointing your entery using a 5 minute chart ?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I believe someone had posed this question earlier in this forum, but i don't believe that it was answered. Forgive me if I am mistaken. What role does the moving averages play in this strategy and what are the rules for using them. Thanks and God Bless

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I raised the question before, and blanca answered she is using same 1hr timeframe to entry and exit. That still confuses me a bit. For exit, doesnot matter any timeframe, as I really see the price mainly for exit. But, entry is on a certain pip, how I see a 1H candle's movements in the chart to pinpoint entry? If anyone has any clear idea about how to decide about entrypoints, please post: as that will help to improve this excellent strategy.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Maybe this will help. Now last night there was a big news event for the gbp pairs. So you knew there could be some big moves for a while. I couldn't stay up to watch it. On the H1 chart, remember that moves here usually will last for several hours. So the up arrow on the chart is when the news hit. See how that candle went up and down a lot with a large tail on the up side. I would not want to enter there with so much movement up and down. I want better candles. The next candle was at 9GMT, a half hour after the news. See how that candle started at the top of the previous candle and then continued long. Now I am interested. You also have to know what session you are trading in. Trade with the trend. This is real common in the london session. Now you see at the down arrow shows the blue arrow turning and going short. This indicates that there is a "potential" reversal going to come in the future. But not right now. So move your stops up as you are making pips and watch the pairs. You have a spinning top candle, then a good long candle, then a short candle. This is also why I like to have a macd also to tell me how the pair is moving. If you like you can also go down to a M30 chart for your exit. It takes time and paper trading. Since the larger charts and time frames have fewer moves a month, it may take you a few months of practice to get this down. That is one of my favorite things knowing the market will be there and there is always another move. When I am ready, the pips will flow. Personally at this time, the pair has moved 70+ pips. Take it. Not a bad day. Beats having a job.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Another great question. Look on the chart that I just posted today of the gbp/jpy. The yellow moving average (which is the 3) is usually in the center of the candles. The blue line (4) is the one to watch. As you can see, the candles are far away from the blue line on that great run long. Stay in the trade. As it starts to peak, they move closer to the blue line and the run may be over. Most times there isn't as much as a gap between the candles and the blue line. But the stronger the run, the larger the gap. Sorry to say this all the time, but paper trade. That is where I build my confidence.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I have notice that the histogram changes depending on what your zoom is. What is the best zoom to look at? I have attached pictures to show the differences I see. These are taken at exactly the same time

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thanks pip pirate2, that is a good explanation and helped a lot.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi, how are you today, about the exit i dont go to smaller timeframes because they could change a lot, maybe 30mins could be, but i guide with the adx and the lsma the color tells me when to stay or go out, as today pip mentioned, the quick moves early we had, i was inside of them tricky all went down and then turned around all, uncrossing, so what i do is to move the stoploss to breakeven as soon as i can got the entry as soon as i saw it, many times it works well but today it did not, so well zero the first 3 shorts, but then god is good and gave us several signals i am just closing them, let me see. gbpjpy +90 pips usdjpy +12 gbpusd +30 eurjpy +2

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Thanks blanca, please keep posting few charts as well, as I can see, in live trading, this is like magic, but we have to learn a lot from you.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
piptrader pls can u post a copy of d macd u r using. @ blanca nice trades, do u use any other indicator apart from d dollie n adx? my major problem is d entry, i have discovered that for explanations, posting charts after d trade is ok, but d entries shown is quite different from d entry during live trading! the major reason is because all indicators r using diffence reference levels n u can find d lsma shifting to a better entry position as d trade progresses which can be very misleading. still trying to understand d entry point. who knows a free program i can use to record d chart in realtime as d trade progresses so i can compare with blanca's entries n exits by doing a playback?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Blanca, If you are going long do you always wait for the LSMA to turn yellow to exit or are there other determining factors for you to decide whether or not to exit such as the blue and white line entering the Overbought zone. The reason why i ask is because i have seen myself be in a trade and the blue and white go up into the OB Zone but the LSMA is still showing green. Another question is you mentioned that you use LSMA and ADX as a guide. Do you use ADX 2 or 13 and are there any particulars that you use to exit using the ADX. Thanks

Hi, Try the product from www dot techsmith dot com , you may like it as this is being used by many.

hi, let me post my last trade today eurjpy short Look the first thing it happens is the cross of the blue and white down the zero line, then inmediately the lsma crosses the pink line, at that moment i go short 165.69 then keep there until lsma changes colour and i see the adx 2 too, for the exit, you can see it right now live, its happening.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Blanca, please correct me if I am wrong. I have posted the image with better markers to ensure if this was your Exact ENTRY point to go SHORT on this pair i.e. Here is my understanding of your current trade: 1) First the Blue and White line went below Zero 2) You waited until LSMA crosses the PINK line. (Right at this moment you went SHORT. 3) You stay in the trade until the LSMA goes OVERSOLD i.e. below level 10 and still stay in the trade until LSMA changes color from RED to yellow. Thanks for your input.

Here is a copy of the macd. One of the problems with making a copy of the entry for me is I am in the trade and not focused on doing anything else. You have to develop a feel for this. I don't know how long you have been trading, but I would recommend that you get a broker that does microlots so you can practice with real money but it's a dollar or less. It really helps.

--- 帖子 #212 ---

--- 帖子 #214 ---
cable is ready for a short? Am I correct?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
yes mega, in fact it was short at 1.9907 and then later turned back i got out at -5 and the other first two at +5 and +5, very very small profits

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks blanca, I managed to take +6 on that trade, also I believe cable is going to have more downswings from now on. Let's see.

I have been following this thread for a while and have been papertrading with some success. I am interested in sometthing Blanca said about exiting a trade when the lsma turns to yellow. Watching the charts, it seems that very often the lsma changes colour and back again several times over a short period of time . Could i ask whether you exit on the first sign of the colour change (potentially moving in and out of trades) or wait to see the colour at the close of the candle I am very exited about this method and think it could be very profitable for me if i could iron out a few wrinkles.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Glad to hear from you and I am very happy that you are paper trading. Maybe I can answer your question. If you notice the lsma is like a moving average as its shape rolls with the pair. So the yellow is a caution sign. I believe and I know Dollie does that you want to use many indicators to make this decision. Let's make an example: Say the pound has run 30 pips on the H1. All of these questions need to be answered first (that's why trading is hard): How long has this run been going? Is there support or resistance near by? What is my profit target? What does the candle look like before this and how is this one shaping out to be? What does another indicator like the macd say? Is this the first wave and could there be a second? Is it with the trend? Is the trend strong? What time of day is it (as it is very important to know this)? Are we at the end of a session, US or london or is this normally a busy time? What are the parallel pairs doing or other pairs with the same currency in it as the one you are trading? The answer is to remember that you can't go broke taking a profit. What will happen is that you can miss some big moves by getting out too early. You can always get back in if you think it is right. But the art of the exit takes time, maybe years to perfect.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Haven't posted in this thread before but have been messing around with this indicator for a while, and I like it. I caught 17 pips this morning on the GU and I'm getting ready to exit this trade over 50 pips on the EURCAD.

A good day for this week.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
1) Hey Blanca, did you sleep last night!!??? because the entries that you took probably are around 2:00am EST if I am not mistaken. 2) Question for you Blanca: I noticed the GBPUSD entry that you took was taken half was into the actual move which roughly took place around 1:30GMT when the price was on or about 1.9914 however you entered a little late around 5:00GMT at 1.9927, where you picked up half of the move. Could you please shed some light on this ? Similar half move entries with EUR/USD, USD/JPY, BP/JPY and EUR/JPY pairs. You are a PRO at this, perhaps we could learn something from your insight. One thing I wanted to add is EXITing out of a trade which is a challenge for us, I read an earlier post where PP2 has shared his thoughts regarding this challenge which I would agree, however, I would still like to have some positive idea on how to EXIT a winning trade with maximum pips rather than taking a few pips and then see the RUN goes through 50 or 60 pips higher. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
yes indeed, i did not sleep last night i am about to go to bed, even though cable and euro are still open but very good results in that one you mention yes i took it late, when so many signals appear at the same time i dont see them all very well, but anyway good day. also at that hour i wake up, little late.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
USD/CAD is setting up for a good Dollie SHORT trade as at 9:56am EST. Does any body see this.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
this set up looks far easier to work with historically than in real time.I entered a sell trade on the usd/jpy as the lsma crossed between pink and blue, only for it to turn back. It appears to me that it would be better only to trade in the direction of the trend on the daily chart (when working with the 1h chart). Would you good people agree with that sentiment or, do you think it could lead to missing out on some valuable pips. Blanca seems to have this licked but i can't see that she just goes on the lsma cross and gets it right so often any ideas?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
-- I agree with your first sentence. You enter a trade based on the dollie method and the trade starts going against you and you are on a roller coaster ride with heart wrenching if you are playing with a live account. Actually if you open a smaller timeframe chart such as 1min or 5min, you will notice that the price retraces a little bit before it starts moving in the direction of your ENTRY. Nonetheless, over a 1 hour period if you leave the trade running (use a DEMO account please!) you will notice that price does move in the direction of your entry. Try it out and please post your results.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Every strategy will have some losing trades, so stoploss is a must. Here is an indicator which will give an idea of main trend, so to be on safe side, if you take only the signals of this great dolly method, along with this indicator (in a 1H timeframe) , losing trades will be much reduced. I am using it for some time now and it filtered out small trends against the major trend. Please check and post comments if any.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Thanks for the indicator. Are you using the default settings for the indicator and do you overlay it over you absolute indicator. Thanks again. God Bless

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi, I use the default settings, in a 1H timeframe. I do not overlay it with absolute indicator window. I put this signal in the main price window. If you look, you will see the overall main trend. You may use it for long term trading as well.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
the big trend indicator also helps to see the main trend, or any othe trend indicator works

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Ok. Thanks i look forward to trying it.

Good to see all the familiar names in this thread. I've talked to HelloDollie on Skype last week and I decided to give this method a go. I backtested the system on the Cable using a 1h chart with a 30pips SL for each trade. I just took the possible trades (all possible trades - not just the safe trades) in the London &amp; NY session (7H00-20H00GMT)(when I am able to trade). The results were unbelievable! 43 trades in total 31 positive trades (72%) 7 negative trades 5 BE trades Total of 962pips profit. Average = 38pips profit per trade Just some interesting stats. These results are just a rought backtest and didn't really take the spread into account. But it will give you a indication of the success of the system. Well done Dollie!! and I'll talk to you during the week.

good work golfer! but i hope u dint just scroll bak to do your baktest cos the indicators change position as u scroll. the best way to baktest this system is to use the strategy tester in mt4 using visual mode. u will c d dollie movements in real time which will give u accurate baktest result.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi Gee That is what I am going to do from next week on. I don't really like backtesting but it gives one an idea of a system. That is usually my first step. The next step is to do actual trading on a demo account. I don't believe in paper trading - only the real thing. Lets see how it does - Cable on a 1h chart.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Dollie, PP or Blanka, I hope that one of you can help me and FXSurfer. Just like FXSurfer in post#25, I have the same problem - the zero line for CCI is not centered between the RSI 10 &amp; 90. In some posts the zero is centered and lately in PP's posts the zero is not centered. I do like the system very much, but this issue is confusing me. Can anybody confirm what is the correct setting? Nobody had the answer for FXSurfer, I hope that I will get the answer. Thanks. Happy piping to all. Pluto2

--- 帖子 #239 ---
The 10 and 90 lines if you scroll backwards and forwards you will see that they move up and down relative to price action or relative strength; but they don't stay in the same position unlike the CCI lines. Is this normal or by design? I don't know.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Nice to see that the thread and method have taken off! Are the indicator overlays still sort of "floating" on top of each other? Maybe I just don't have it set up right. What's the latest "base" system that everyone's using? Does anyone have a moment to post a chart and list indicators and their settings? or maybe just a template is easier. Many thanks! FXS

Hi guys I have been part of a group who have been trading successfully now. Well not as successful as most using this sytem. We are in a chat room in Skype all day long, some from Tokyo open some from London and some from Us open. So we are parctically in the room 24/7. I think it would be a great idea fro all using this sytem to join into the chat room. That way when one sees a trade oppurtunity arise, we can quickly comfirm it with each other, live. Look me up on skype, 'spiritbreezer', it's the only one. AndI can add you guys to the room, or if someone want to start a new room dows not matter. We are quite a large group, experienced guys, some working in trading houses, so we get some inside info sometimes. Good trades to all for the week.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I saw some discussion earlier on exits, and I have been using a combination of the 5 and 12 MA's with an ADX (2) cross. If I am with the 4 hr trend, I'll tend to stick with the ma's for more pips, but if it is bucking the trend, but still a good looking set-up, I will follow the ADX which tends to get me out quicker. RSI (21) can keep you in a trend for a long time as well. I have them all on my charts and keep an eye on them all. No hard and fast rules, mostly discretion.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I don't know Pluto2 about how it appears to not be centered. Looking back on my charts and current graphs, things seem to be fine. Dollie is the indicator queen as I am just a follower and do what she has shared with the group.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
i hav an idea! mayb blanca can help us on this. blanca please can u tell me the mt4 broker u r using so i can get their server file. so just like u have been doing, when u enter a trade, give us the price at which u entered, but this time let us know if it is at the bid or ask price i.e for a short or long. so what i will do is at the end of d day, i whill use strategy tester in visual mode which shows the movement tick by tick like its in realtime, to pinpoint exactly when u entered and exit. i will then post the chart to show ur exact point of entry like it was in realtime so people can c n understand it. this is because posting a chart after the trade has been done is very misleading.... due to the overlay of the indicators (always changing positions when u scroll bak or zoom). hope im making sense? for starters, u can post ur template so i can use ur exact settings. thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
-- I second that geezng, I noticed that the LSMA moves up and down if you move the chart back and forth, so yes it is a bit misleading. I am looking for direction in this area as well.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I'll 3rd it! Thanks! FXS

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi geezng, thanks for looking into it .

My first trade today on EURU$ using the HelloDollie system (in a very slow day). 10pips profit - not to bad for a start. Still need to learn a lot and get a feel for a longer time frame trade.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi golfer , congratulations! You are the first one in this thread, who mention results about backtesting this method. That’s the first step that everybody who want’s to trade on live, have to do. Just like you I’been doing paper trading since Octuber of 2006, but with all the filters on the absolute strenght index(just the safe trades) and the results were amazing. The problem of doing this, is that you don't really reconized where is the price, when all the filters are ok. For each trade I had to take the next candle after all the filters were ok. Do you know how can I backtesting this system using the strategy tester in mt4? I'm not a system programer. Excuse me for my English.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi Jun That was the way I've done it. I took the opening of the next candle as my entry and close of the candle were the exit signal appeared. SO I think my results are the "worst" scenario. I just made sure that 30pip SL was not triggered. I've tried the Strategy Tester but didn't manage to get it up and running - I think I need more time with it. Never used it before therefore I am not familiar with it but it seems like one needs a EA. Lets see how it goes on a demo account. I was also very impressed with the degree of accurate trades. Like any other system - there will be negative trades.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
1st u have to go to tools-&gt;options menu. enable expert advisor. pls make sure u disable live trading if u r using a live account. next u make sure u save the dollie template. open strategy tester, u can use any ea, it doesnt matter. make all necessary settings n click start. immediately it starts, u can then load d dollie template. u can use the slide bar on the visual mode to adjust the speed of the candles. i have attached an image. hope it helps. u dont have to do anything as regards the seting of the ea.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi Geezng, I'll try it. Thanks for your help!

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi Gee From my side - also thank you. I'll give it a try.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Nailed this one on the EURAUD today. It seems the best set-ups are when the lsma comes from either up high or down low and crosses either the rsi line or the absolute line and there is nice separation between these lines as in the picture.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I want to set up my chart but i dont understand RSI 2. Is the indicator named rsi 2? i have an indicator named RSI is that the correct one? And if then what should my value be? its current value is 14 is the instruction on the first page of this page still correct or have they changed?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
The rsi value should be 2, that's why it is rsi 2. I think you can find the template somewhere.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
juhp thanks! i found it =) but when i check recent post made in this thread they have an rsi window and another indicator on it. are those indicators also found and explained in this thread? im only at the beginning of the thread. =)

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi, other indicators are added by each traders to their own ease I think. Some are discussed, but you can use any other filters to suit your style. I personally use and prefer adx indicator in a window.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi blanca, good to see you here, where were you? We miss your daily trade comments.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Megapips perhaps you or someoneelse could be sp kind and uppload the indicators used and make an template also? it would surley be much apreciated by all us newbies =)

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Here are a few indicators. Remember that no one indicator is perfect and what we are trying to do is increase the odds. That is why it is important to use several indicators and which ones are your choice. Please paper trade this system for weeks and take notes. Also this is what I did because it works for me. I loaded up all the indicators I wanted to use in 12 pairs and then went back to look for good pip moves at different time frames. Then I made several word files and pasted charts that had these moves. do this for a few weeks and you will have dozens of examples to look at and see what the indicators did prior to the big moves. These work best on M30 and above time frames. The ADX 13 is on your Meta 4 platform. go to insert, indicators, then average directional movement index and then change the settings to 13. the zerolag macd also has a rsi 2 indicator on top of it.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
My two trades yesterday using only the Dollie indicator window. I was only able to trade the NY session EUR$ = +8pips GBP$ = +10pips

--- 帖子 #264 ---
hi, sorry for not posting recently but i`ve had to trade till late, and then rest, hope everyone is doing fine.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thank you very much! Is the indicator explained in this thread? I will take the weekend to study this hread and take notes! Is everything you need to know in this thread or do i hafto find information somewhere else to master this strategy?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
It's all here. Like I said before, take your time and get the feel for how they all work. the market will be here when you are confident to trade live. paper trade then micro lots then minis. remember: once you have succeeded in making money on a monthly basis with micro or minis, financial freedom is a 6-12 months away. so I am patient until I feel I have it down with small amounts because once you have it, 10k a month is right around the corner.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi good job you are doing here but the problem with trade on Indicators is you have to watch it all time so if someone could add an alert to the combination to alert when blue and pink crossing would be so helpful . Thanks.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thanks for the input. The challenge with alarms on this indicator is that there would be too many false signals at every cross. Not every cross is a buying opportunity. If you can write the code it would be welcomed.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
well I know it would be so much false signal but it will be so easier to follow th charts in different pairs. well for now I really do not have time even for trading ....well maybe I wrote it later if no one would do it till then thanks

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hello PIP, I've been doing paper trade for a while over the cable(4HR) and the test looks promisings. But we found over March and February some loss trades, which we want to filter. On those trades, we found that all buyings and sellings took it in overbought and oversold leves were filter OK. Here is my question: do you take trades on those levels?(the problem is: that some good trades are filter too!!) The other, is related with the timeframes and broker provider; we compared some chrarts posted by dolly and we found that were diferent over 4HR charts. The backtest of this method would be differend rely on which broker do we use?? My broker is on GMT +2. Excuse me for my English.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Could someone try to explain how the adx and the macd are used with this strategy? It would be very helpful. thanks ps. please post more pictures with setups! =)

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Sorry everyone but I lost my hard drive last week and now am back. I like the macd for a few reasons. Notice when the bars are almost flat for several time frames, usually 3 or 4. Then a big move is likely to happen. They also tell you when the energy is running out of the move. It is a lagging indicator so it is a little slow. The adx is good when the DI+ and the DI- are moving apart and the other line is in the center. My line is green so when the green line moves between the DI+ and DI-, these two are moving apart with good angle and strength that means that the currency move has some strength. Take snap shots of the pairs that have made good moves and after a while you will see the patterns.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Personally I do like to see overbought and oversold situations. The pair seem to be tired of going in one direction and may reverse. You must take into account the overall trend and make sure that you are not planning on making massive pips on a reversal of the overall trend. You will see that the different time frames when there is a move have different pip potentials. The bigger the time frame, the fewer the moves but the bigger pip potential. Most of us trade on a meta 4 platform so you might want to use a broker that uses that platform. The charts do change somewhat between brokers. That is why I say all the time that you and everyone else including me have to ultimately figure this out for yourselves. It is a tool and what works right for you will be different than me. Patience and practice.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
What happened to this forum? Blanca and I are gone for a week and no one is posting. Isn't anyone making money with it? These are great indicators that work if you work with them and learn. I hope it doesn't die.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
im looking forward to se some more posts/trades in this thread!

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Okay if there is still anyone interesting in this incredible system left besides blanca, vhek and me, I will be adding a new and improved dollie this weekend to the post. Let me take the time on the weekend to write the whole thread and all the information with templetes. Remember that you will have to load it and then practice it for weeks before it may make sense. Blanca and I have been studying it for a few weeks and that is why we haven't posted much. Dollie has done it again and made it better. Will be using it with several of the other indicators also. Stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I just discover this thread yesterday and spend the whole afternoon going through. What a great system !!! I install all the indicators and could see on my charts the greats opportunities this morning (unfortunatly I was a little bit too late to catch the moves ) I will give it a good shot at it and try to become familiar with it. I don't see any need for an EA but if somebody can make an alert just based on the cross of blue and pink line it would be way more easier to monitor several pair at the same time. After that it's up to us to look and decide if everything else is in agreement to take the trade or not. I can't do it myself, my comp skills are far away from that !!! I would like to thanks Dollie for sharing this strategy with us and many others like Pip Pirate 2, Blanca, Golfer ...... for their great posts, explanations, etc. It's a great help to understand. I hope this thread will not die here as I think it's a great learning tool. Sorry if my English is not very good, but it's not my mother language. Al

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hello Blanka and PP, thanks for the effort. I am looking forward to the "new improved" templates. I think that many people (like me) are following this thread &amp; using the system. They just are not posting. Once again, many thanks to both of you and Dollie. Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #279 ---
PipPirate I am looking forward to the new templates. Thanks

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Pip, maybe this results can help this forum. I've been doing Backtesting over some currencys pairs and this one sorprise me. I added an Ind made by an guy named, Damiani. He won a 2 nd prize in a EA competition last year. The way is used is: when the green line crosses above the white, we've seen market getting into a trend be it short term or long. When the white crosses above the green we've seen the market begining a range or alredy entered into it, this last signal filtered a lot bad trades; please add this ind on the 4hr charts and do backtested and you would watch what I'm talking about. This ind was add in another forum of forex factory by a master trader named Marketsniper. Conditions off backtesting: USDCHF; 4HR; first signal: blue line cross pink; sec sig: CCI(6) above or below 0; Third sig: LMSA bet blue and pink. This backtesting was taken over close candels(worse scenario); and this results have the Damiani filter added. From Jan 2007 Trades: 40(100%) Positive: 30(75%) Negative: 10(25%) I hope this results could helpfull this system, and everybody have the patient to research and backtest. Regards to all. Excuse me for my English.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thanks for your post PP2. I'm wondering how better this indicator can be. I can see more than 400 pips possible today on my charts only on the 4 majors (1h charts)!!!! But as I'm totally new to this thread and I know I don't know yet all the belts and whistles I'm ready to learn more and eager to know and use it (demo first) By the way, what do you think about an alert when blue and pink cross as a warning something may be happening soon? Thanks. I'm waiting for the announcement. Al

--- 帖子 #282 ---
My second trade using this method - not really familiar with this system and the longer time frame. Enter too late (firs ellipse) and exit (second ellipse) when indicators went into overbought area. Made 8pips profit. Just interesting to see not really any charts with trades on this thread (mine was the last post on the previous page in June 2007) for discussion.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I just discovered this thread great stuff, thanks for the hard work and sharing. Q

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thanks for the posts! I wasn't sure if anyone is out there. Like I said I will do some more work on the weekend to make it long and detailed.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi keep up the good work, I've been following thread from early on (still new to forex so don't really feel qualified enough to comment yet about some of the detailed points raised), but the system seems easy to use (it looked very confusing at first put once you sit down and look at it, it's really simple) and very profitable on demo account. Some of the input from you guys has helped a newbie like me alot. So keep up the good work and I looked forward to more post's on this thread

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I'm new in this forum.... I see this forum from the first page, i see the sistem... I post the templat in diferent pars, and i have dificulty to discovery a point of entry.... i use most the GBPUSD... can you help me with a foto of today or yesterday, with the points of entry... Can you post the last template... Thanks and i'm sorry for my english i hope you understend me

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Welcome swirly! I like your comments because you say you were following from the beginning and you say it looks confusing but it's not with time. Thank you for saying that because I hope many people read this. You are studying it , demo account and learning. Success is in your future. Be prepared to study some more after this weekend and the new posts.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Dear Pepejeans: You are doing well with the english as we can understand you with a few mistakes. I only speak english and some say I don't do that good of a job. I will show you a new indicator and template of many pairs this weekend as I don't use dollie anymore. I use the new one. Entry is hard for all of us and that is one of the secrets to learning how to trade. It will take time and paper trade for practice.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Thanks pip pirate 2

--- 帖子 #290 ---
After almost a week now studying this strategy, got my first winning trade, +15 on GBP/USD (could have done more, but didn't follow the exit rules. My mistake!) I'm happy to see that I'm not the only newbie on this thread, wecome Jazzman, Swirly, Pepejean, and thanks to you Pip Pirate 2 for your work, and looking forward after the week end. Did I read correctly, you are not using Dollie anymore? Al

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I hope you will direct those of us who are more of the readers than posters so we can follow this new method. kevin

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I am using a variation of dollie that she shared with me a few weeks ago. As I posted earlier I formated my hard drive by accident trying to add another hard drive (saved all the data first but still felt dumb) and so lost everything and had to reload. So I decided not to load dollie as I wasnt using it anyway. My post on saturday will be long and detailed so that is why I want to wait and not do it during trading time.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi Pip Pirate 2, thanks for the explanation. I understand now. Aaarrrrgggg sorry for your comp problems, these little beasts are sometime capricious and difficult to dominate (at least for me too) Hope everthing is ok now. I hope you will post some stat results too. You and Blanca look pretty sharp with this method ! I like this thread and the method. Very educative and simple and hope in a near future to be able to share good results and help back too. See you soon. Al

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Looking forward to use and test the new modified Dollie &amp; templates PP2.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi PP2 If people are not posting, it does not mean they are not there. I have not had a chat with you before, but had several with Dollie &amp; Blanca on other strategies. Hope to talk to you to soon in the future. Keep up the good work and do not be discouraged if people are slow to post. Regards

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Here we go. First I want to remind everyone of a few things. This indicator or any comments from me are never to be seen as investment advice. No buy, sell or hold recommendations ever. I am not licensed to recommend any forex investments and people can and do lose money trading. Trade at your own risk. That is why I will not give out exact entry and exit numbers on this site. Okay now to the indicators. I play around with the standard colors so make them your own. All of these first 5 are put on the same indicator: RS I Triple Hull 6 Make the input 6. My colors are violet, Style 3 Lime Style 1. Take out the levels 85 and 15 CCI 6 Make the input 6. Color White Dotted lines Add Level 0 RSI 2 Make the input 2 Color Deep Sky Blue Width 2 LSMA Make all the colors Deep Pink Width 2 Stochastic Colors all black Add Level 10 and 90. RSI Triple Hull and LSMA are below and the other indicators are on your platform. Now create another separate indicator: ZeroLag MACD leave as is. RSI 2 Make the input 2 color deep sky blue Now create another separate indicator: Dynamic Zone 14, 20, 5 Leave it alone and use as is. This one is fantasic Add Stocastic with the same rules as above. Now make another indicator: ADX 13 with stocastic. The ADX is on your computer. Go to the top and click on insert, indicators, average directional movement index. Change the input to 13. My colors are deep sky blue on DI+ and deep pink on DI-. Style color is lime and Apply to: Close. Dollie likes to add a lsma to this indicator also with the normal green, yellow and red lines. I just don't do that as it is too busy for me but you should do as Dollie says. Show it should all look like this:

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Here are the other indicators. I forgot to mention that the HMA Color is a moving average that I got from Blanca and I use in with the candles.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Here are some examples of the system. So at the top indicator RSX Triple Hull ( I know it comes out as RSX instead of RSI) and we see the arrow pointing to a great setup. The blue line is going long strong, the pink line is moving with it and the dotted lines are inside of the two. This is the ideal. The blue line will move around all the time but the pink line (LSMA) must be committed to the move. If it is flat there is no trade. Next you see the second arrow and usually when the two lines make a good cross the move is about to be over. Now look at the dynamic zone. The green line is moving long and with good angle. It crosses the blue line and there is a wide gap between the green and blue line. Very good. As long as they are separated things are good. So you want to use the indicators together and not to rely on just one. you can see the pair went short after the long move but the Triple ( as we are going to call RSX Triple Hull from now on) doesn't show us the best charts. But look at the dynamic zone and the green line. Also you will notice that I use a pivot indicator with my candles .

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Here is another example: Notice how the triple had started its move before the candles indicated a short move was happening. So you will see with this that the indicator starts to make the move and of course it has not fully developed. This is where practice makes perfect as you study how the indicator develops as it is moving. Next notice in the dynamic zone that the green line is moving short well and then breaks out of the bollinger bands (that is what the orange lines with the red dotted lines are) and contiues short. Good move. When the green line is in the stochastic 10 or 90 the move is usually over and can be time to get out. It is overbought or oversold. Wait for reversals. Now the added bonus of support from the adx 13. When the green line is between the blue and pink and the blue and pink are spreading apart like that that indicates a strong move. So now you have three indicators telling you go for it. As a side note, when Dollie first showed me this is was confusing and I thought no way will I be able to look at all the indicators. So what I did was to study one indicator a week with many pairs and understand how it works. Then move on to the next one.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Here is another one: First see how in triple the blue line is going up and down a lot with false signals but the pink line is flat. No trade. Finally the pink line commits and this chart is not the best but you will find that triple will look different with certain pairs. But the green line in dynamic is saying there could be a good move. Next you see the short move. Triple looks good. Notice the green line in dynamic is in the overbought range at 90 and then moves short after crossing the orange and blue lines with a good distance between it and the blue line going down. Then Triple goes long one more time. Notice that when the green line on dynamic goes sideways at the red dotted line that is a caution signal. Market is flat and doesn't know what to do. May go either way so proceed with caution. Now notice the zerolag macd indicator. Here is where I think it comes into play. Notice before the first move long the chart had hours of almost flat macd bars. Good sign. If you see the macd bars flat for a few or more time frames it can be a signal that a move is coming.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Here is one for the part timers who can't be at their computers all the time. Also it is for the big thinkers who really understand the power of these indicators and also looking long term. I haven't been trading that long ( less than 3 years which is nothing) but I do understand that someday I will not be trading all the time. Wouldn't it be nice to look at the charts for a little time every day and wait for the big moves? You can make big money that way but it take time to learn and also big stops. So don't do it right away. But look at this chart and move. See how the triple started showing you a long move many days ahead of the move. Also notice that the blue line did go short during this setup but did not touch the pink line. Important. Now look at the green line in dynamic. It told you to wait until it started to go long also. See how the green line stays above the blue line for weeks! Important to notice. May be an indication to stay in the trade. It you did catch this trade you can slowly move the stops up. This is a 300+ pip move. Now also see the ADX 13 is perfect with the green line between the pink and blue. The green line in adx will stay at the top as an indicator that the move is still strong. Since it is a daily chart and this is the pound you must know that the pair will move 100+ of pips a day within this bigger move long so you must practice.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
That is all for now. I will post next week some more examples. But here is what I recommend as I have said a lot: Paper trade! Spend the next few weeks learning how they work and then paper trade and then trade with small lots. Use several indicators at the same time to decide if the trade makes sense. Most of your questions will be answered over time by studying them but I will answer questions in this forum if I have time. Get excited as you can be successful with these. And of course a "BIG shout out" to Dollie for creating the triple and these indicators and system. I am just the follower and student. I really am no one special but I am very serious about winning this game so I study a lot and take many notes every day. You cannot be disciplined in great things and undisciplined in small things. Brave undisciplined men have no chance against the discipline and valor of other men. Have you ever seen a few policemen handle a crowd? General George S. Patton

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I for one will start looking at these indicators this week so as to compare to ones I now use. Almost looks to busy but it is clear that they work together to give clear signals. Thanks for the work you have put into this and sharing it with us. kevin

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi PP2 have you got a template you could post with all these indicators applied? I've set my settings as described but when I'm comparing the charts to the one's you've posted they don't seem to match, it's probably me not quite getting it right. And thanks for all the effort your putting in on this thread it's really appreciated

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Here is another thing I forgot to tell you. Sometimes on some of the time frames the dotted line signals in triple disappear. They just aren't there so don't panic. Check other times with that pair and you will see what is going on. Here are some templates.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks Pip

As you point out Kevin all these indicators and lines do look very busy. Two good points: First is you and everyone else should always use what works for you if you are making pips. Don't change because I or anyone else says so. Second, I resisted learning them all at first. But as I stated earlier, I started with one at a time and learned it and then moved on to the next one. It seems to work for me. There are so many ways to make money in forex you have to find the one that works for you and do it.

I noticed that in the charts that you posted that you primarly use the 30 minute time frame. Is it possible to use the 1 hour time frame or do you personally prefer to use the 30 min. Thanks

--- 帖子 #309 ---
As I stated, I was using charts that had the clearest lines to illustrate the "perfect looking setup" I could find at the time. Using the H1 chart would be the best as that is what Dollie and Blanca use and I try to use more often. The bigger time frames will probably give the best signals.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I was asked to give specific rules for trading this system so I wanted to post for all to see. I hesitated originally to do this because I don't know if my way of thinking works like everyone else. To me the rules are a series of things happening at the same time but not exactly do 1, 2, 3,etc. You have to look at several of the indicators to confirm the move. Well here goes (and now you'll know I am crazy): Overall market lookout: Check the Daily, H4, H1 and M30 charts for all the pairs. What is the trend today? Is the moves going with the overall trend? Are there a series of small candles ready to become big? What time of day is it and is this a normal time to have good moves? Don't be fooled by great signals at the wrong time of day as the moves may be really short. How does the overall market feel today? Is there a lot of energy in the pairs or is it dead? Careful of the dead times. Is there a big news event? Careful before news events On Triple Hull: What is the blue line doing? Is it moving at a good strong angle long or short? The Blue RSI is fast and will give many false signals so you must add all the other factors to it before making a trade. Are the dotted lines following inside with it at the same angle? Are they all above the zero line? Is the pink (LSMA) line following? How committed is it and is it going at the same angle? The lsma is slower than the blue RSI line but is it following. If the pink line is flat stay out of the trade. Dynamic Zone Is the green line on the dynamic in the 90 or 10 area? If yes it is overbought or oversold. So when it moves from there pay attention. The green line moves a little slower than the blue RSI lines but is it also moving in the right direction? How strong is the angle? Is the green line separated from the blue line in the dynamic zone? Has the green line broke through the yellow Bollinger bands in dynamic on its way to 90 or 10? Could be good. Zerolagg MACD Are the candles in MACD moving in the same direction as you want to go or changing to move that way? Are there little candles for several time frames ready to explode? This is good. ADX 13 Are the blue and pink lines separating at a good angle? Is the green line in adx moving long to show strength in this movement? Is the green line inside of the pink and blue lines? This is very good. So you need to use several of these rules (if you choose and they make sense to you) at the same time to make your decision. I have explained many times that I can not tell you when exactly to enter or exit. You alone should make that decision as we all are different.

My first trade today on $Y (very slow market to get the feel) after studying the examples and rules. I did look at: the Tripple - between the lines; Dynamic - upper part of BB ADX - blue crossed the purple I hope it makes sense and comments are very welcome. I know the trade didn't comply with all the rules. I am still not sure about the rules but I am sure I'll get there.

Thank you very much Pip Pirate2 for sharing these indicators, it's very kind of you . As you are using them since longer than us can you tell us if you have a more successful rate with this one or the first Dollie, and are they equally good on 30' like on most of your examples or another time frame? It's a little bit difficult to compare your snapshot with my charts because the LMSA "evolve" with time on the whole chart and for example on the first example you show us post 298, you have under your first arrow the blue line on the triple touching the pink, on my chart today it's not the case, the blue line never went that far down (same phenomena on the other examples) Anyway I will test that mainly on the 30' and 1h and at the beginning with only the triple and Dynamic indicators. When the blue is crossing the pink on the Triple with the dots lines following the move AND the green crossing the blue on the dynamic it seems to be a reliable signal. I totally undestand your viewpoint concerning giving signals here, but some past statistics would be wecome, and as they are past they are useless to take a trade right away! Any news from Blanca ? Are her amazing results were with these indicators or the first Dollie? Good testing and results to everyone. Al

Is it just me or are there others who are having trouble with the Triple hul showing up on the one hour chart? The window opend and it all shows up in every time frame, but the 1 hour chart has no lines at all in the window. I have closed it and reopened it, I have checked the time settings and I just have an open window with no lines on the 1 hr chart. Jumping from the 30 min to the 4hr chart with out looking at the 1hr chart is not a good idea, or at least not for me because to much is missed. Any ideas? Thanks kevin

--- 帖子 #314 ---
To answer your questions: Yes I am only using the triple not dollie's anymore and having more success and seeing clearer signals. It does work on time frames above M30. Many people are having a hard time trying to duplicate my examples. All I can say is I don't know how the software works for backtesting but I have heard others complain before about this. Personally I don't care about the past. The indicators do seem to have some slight variation between two users at the same time in real time in the market. Make copies of moves and paste them in a word file for your own review. Blanca is doing excellent and she is using the new indicators. We all get busy and can't post all the time.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
As I stated in a previous post, I too have found that the lines can disappear in certain time frames and I don't know what to do about it. I find it is only with one or two pairs. If you see the dotted lines inside of the 30 min then they are also inside the H1 even if you can't see them.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
For the record? I could not take not seeing the lines on the 1hr chart with the hull indicator and got to messing around. I have found a fix to the problem so here it is, hope it works for you as it does for me. 1. Uncheck the "All timeframes" box 2. check from the 15 minute to the daily including the hourly 3. close it and problem should be fixed. I have found that "sometimes" the lines will not show up in the 1hr chart and I go to the 30 min chart then back again and they show up for me. Hope this helps as I like this indicator the best. kevin

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Again I use the M30 only as an illustration to show what I call a perfect setup for triple hull and dynamic. See on the long move that triple let you know something could be coming. The dotted lines are inside of the blue and pink and the pink then moves long and has good angle. Then the green in dynamic is excellent with angle and separation from the blue. Then the reverse short isn't as pretty but you could have known that that move was possible.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Again just another example. Look at the far left and see that long move. That is a beautiful triple hull chart and the green from dynamic says go. Now the blue line on triple did go short and cross the pink line which may have signaled to get out of the trade. but look at the green dynamic. It never touched the blue line but did continue to go long. Signal to stay in if you want to. The doji candle at the top of the move could be a reason to close the trade.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi PP2 I have a few questions: Why do you call it triple Hull? I thought Hull is a specific indicator. At least on other charting services it is. On Dynamic zone: I think it is dangerous to look at osilators concerning overbought and oversold. The only time that can be remotely reliable is in a range bound market. In a trending market you will almost always burn your fingers. A much better setting will be a line at 50, that way if the RSI is above 50 the sentiment is long and if below 50 the sentiment is short. ADX: A good idea is to look when the -DI, +DI and ADX lines are below 20, that normally is an indication that the market is ranging and not trending. Keep up the good work. Regards Silver

In line with my previous posts, the following. I added my own version of longer term trend on the price action, notice on both the 5min and 1h chart price tend to move up when thick lime line is above thich red and visa versa. I also added a line at 25 on the ADX, notice that when ADX, +DI and-DI are below this line the market is very flat or in a range. On RSI I added a line at 50, read my previous post on this. Notice that when both RSI and ADX plus +DI are above the added lines then probability of an long move is much higher. When RSI and is below the lines plus ADX and -DI above then probability of short move is great. Remember that the ADX line itself is only an indication of the strength of the trend and not direction. The +DI and -DI give the direction. Notice I have added a template in the previous post for this. Regards

Dear Silver: Thanks for your input. It is most welcome. First I didn't make or name the triple hull indicator, Dollie did. I wouldn't have a clue how to do it. You observations and suggestions on dynamic and adx are correct and a good addition. As I have stated I am just a student and put out there my observations on what I see. What I love about this forum is we can all share and figure this out together as I know I need help too. That's the best thing about forex is the helpfulness of everyone.

PP@ What name do you use on the 5min chat?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Silver if you mean phillip's 5 min I am no longer a part of that chat room. No offense to Phillip or anyone else there I just decided to focus solely on Dollie's system for the last few months. We all are searching for the system that seems to make sense for each of us and this so far makes sense to me. It's not for everyone and each simply needs to find the way to make money.

My trade yesterday on $J. I've opened the trade, and then went to bed. This morning I've closed half and put a 15pips trailing SL. Nett profit of 48pips.

Hi PP2 I was watching the $Y today and once again saw this setup. I wanted to enter but couldn't because of a power failure. I was about to enter where the green vertical line is: Tripple: -----lines between blue and purple and going at nice angle Dyna: Green crossed blue and on the way up ADX: Blue crossed purple Seems like all the indicators were in line for long setup. Am I correct. Busy studying the rules and your examples to get a feel for this system. You don't really wait for a candle to close before entry? That would have been my third positive trade in a row with Dollie on 30min. On the $Y and almost the same time of the day. Just an interesting observation.

In my way of trading you don't have to wait for the candle to close, you know if it is right. One thing to watch for is the time of day. You are several hours in the US session as you know and there will probably not be that many pips on this pair at that time. Which is not a problem so watch the move, move your stop and take the pips.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
My fourth positive trade in a row with this system. I was worreid about the Dyna and ADX not yet giving a good signal. Usually I do use a 15pip SL and move it to BE as soon as possible (6-10pips move in the direction of the trade). After taken my first half I followed the price with 15pip trailing SL and I didn't really look at the indicators.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Just a quick trade yesterday late and there was no real movement in the market. The indicators looked to be in line but the entry was a bit late. +3pips profit but with an earlier entry it could have been 10pips or more. Still to have a negative trade with this system - amazing and I don't really follow the rules. Just trying to all the indicators in line (almost) and get a feel for it (the reason why I trade in the quite times).

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Wow, what a period of trading - 6 positive trades in a row. This is today's trade. Once again, the Triplle was move up in line and the Dynamic's green line has crossed the blue upwards. It was just the ADX that was not in line - it crossed later but so late in the day I cannot let the profit runs. I don't know if somebody is reading this thread anymore but just my small contribution.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Golfer and others: This thread is still alive. I review it several times a day looking for posts and ready to answer questions. I felt that I was taking over and don't want to do that. I assume that everyone is still practicing and learning the system. Golfer you are doing a great job. Don't worry that all the indicators don't line up because that is rare. Results are what matters. Keep posting and look forward to others with their results.

For what it is worth, I check in here almost every day and am really liking this method. I have noticed that it looks as though the Triple hull is not giving a correct reading on the 1hr charts. Perhaps it's me but it goes against every other time frame. kevin

Perhaps it's me but it goes against every other time frame. kevin[/quote First thanks for checking in and helping us out. Not doubting what you said on the H1 but would love to see some charts. Here are a few from today although maybe not the best. Remember that I stated in the rules that the triple is an indicator that tells you a move is coming in the future, not right now. The bigger the time frame, the longer before the move hits. On the charts, the arrow on triple shows that a move is coming and it was 2 hours ahead of the move. Then you see the blue line drop, the dotted lines follow. The pink was not committed on this example. Next you see on the zerolag macd that the bars are realitively flat before the move; another good sign. Finally on the green in dynamic it tells you when to get in the trade. Unfortunately I was away from the computer at this time as it is not normally a good time to trade. But the later part of the US session lately has had some moves. Unbelievable 240 pips plus drop today. I'm still learning also.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
My trade today on Cable. The Tripple once again was coming from oversold with a good angle between blue and purple. Dynamic starting going up and ADX about to change to long. Result is 11pips profit (moved to 14pips and my TP was at 18pips). I do trade with a 15pips SL. I'm still learning the trade setup and the reading of the indicators (not that easy!). At this stage I don't fully trust the indicators and that is why I enter almost too late. But I'm sure it will become beter.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Way to go Golfer! Look at the charts the move short before your move, as you say you still don't trust the indicators. Well we all have that challenge including me sometimes. The triple is looking great on the short with the pink line committed. Macd's are going smaller. The green line on dynamic is strong to the short side and crosses the blue line and the adx has the green line cutting between the blue and pink. That's a fantastic setup. Notice how the triple started moving short one candle before the move. You still did well with your trade. Let's see you go for 10 in a row!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
My trade on eurjpy yesterday - it was a Friday afternoon but the price was very lively. Difficult to trade. I did enter (with 0.4 lots according to my money management schedule) after price crossed my R1 pivot line and Triplle was showing me the entry was almost too late. Zerolagg turned upwards the candle before so did the green line on Dynamic. ADX was about to cross but the green line was coming down towards 20 - not a good sign. But it was late on a Friday evening. Also a double bottom formed. I did exit first half of trade (0.2 lots) after 14pips profit (nett 7pips) and I moved my SL 6pips above entry and it was tiggered later (nett 3pips). On the chart only my first exit is shown. Result is 10pips profit.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Just my comments on the previous setup - I know there aren't rules for this system but I am trying to put it on the table. For example the previous setup on EURJPY (the one before my actual trade): What I would like to see on the Triplle is that the blue and pink line is in/near die oversold area (Point A) and coming out of it with a good angle. Pip P2 - that means a move up backwards is on the way, corrct? Look at my previous trade and see the pink line is very far away form the oversold area - risky trade? Next I would like to see the green line touching/in the oversold area ("B") on Dynamic and then coming out of it. At "C" the green line crosses the blue line meaning it is time to enter. The Zerolag bars is still below 0 but it is getting close and the ADX D+ and D- only cross at "D". Just my thoughts on this system combining with the advice from Pip Pirate 2. Trying to work out a practical approach to this system. At this stage it is working during the late NY trading sessions.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I liked the second example that you have all the notes on and with letters A BC &amp; D. You are correct on the triple (A)as it is telling you something could be coming and I like the look of the triple. Dynamic green (C) is also very good. Notice that the candle on the macd is very small at the same time as the dynamic cross. I am working on a theory about this as I like to see very small candles on macd signaling a move is coming. As I have stated ADX doesn't always give a signal. You have got it Golfer. Just know that your style and time of the day to trade ( I know that is the only time for you to trade) as you have shown is for about 10 pips or so of profit so I would be in front of the computer and take the 10 as they come. Can't get greedy. 9 in a row is great and thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi PP2 Thanks for the advice. Yes, I did some backtesting yesterday and I've realised that my trades will only give 10-20pips profit. And I am using a 15pips SL. Risk ratio is 1:1. What I am trying to do is see if a dialy H or L was formed and then look for a re-tracement (counter trend (CT) trade) if a signal appears. Then I use the 5min chart to enter - not really taking Phillip's Nel 5min system's rule into consideration. But I do want to use the principles to enter the trade. I'll work on it this week and hopeful post it during the week. We are also working on a 15min (I concentrate on divergence) system and if I can combine the three - the better. Currently I am just following 4 pairs - EURU$, Cable, U$JPY and EURJPY. I am not very keen on CT trades but it looks like with this system it might work.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I saw the 2 setups today on $JPY (details on chart) and EURJPY (zoomed in). I don't think they come better than this. On Line A Triple is telling us a down movement is coming and the green line on the Dynamic as well as the lsma 3 on ADX is in the overbought area. On Line B the green is coming out of the overbough area to cross the blue line and the Isma is turning red. The Triple is showing a good signal downwards and the ----lines are crossing the 0-line nicely between the blue and pink line. I would have entered on the opening of candle 1 thereafter the Isma entered the area between DX- and DX+ at point D (I think that was one of Dollie's orginal suggestions). At point 2 Triple is telling us a possible up move is coming and the same setup is visible on line "C". Enter on opening of candle 3 with Isma entering the area between DX- and DX+ at point "E". The same setup can be seen on the EURJPY chart - I've just zoomed in on the chart. I hope some of you got the trades - even if it is not according to my analysis.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
You are so right. You are getting it and that is a perfect setup. I am jealous of those of you that live in the european time zone to trade this. Here is my trade summary for the month of July, which is the best I have ever done due to this system. I had 73% positive trades, 5% breakeven, and 18% losses (these numbers are approximate). Half of those losses I was not upset with as they had broken thru solid support levels and I would have done those trades again as they followed my rules. Sometimes those trades just don't work. But I am very happy with Dollie and this system.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi PP2 Don't worry, we are "almost" in the same boat. I can only trade "seriously" after 15H00GMT. Because I do have a full time job. Sometimes I can put in a trade during office hours. After tomorrow I'll see what my summary looks like. Luckily I had a few chats with Dollie and she motivates me to use the system. In the begining it was way too complicated but you just need to concentrate and know your market/pairs. Which I am busy learing through the 4h, 15min &amp; 5min systems of Phillip. Speaking of Dollie - I'll think I'll give a call/chat in the near future to thank her again.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
The outcome of the first month of trading this system with a demo account after about 2 months of studying and backtesting. I am just stuggling with the entry points but I am trying now to combine Phillip Nel's 5min system as well as his 4hMACD to determine the entry point. 9 positive trades - not to bad for a novice. My main trading times are after 15H00GMT - the reasons for the small profit margins.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I think I mentioned this before but I have been studying how the macd's react before a big move. It appears in my research that the zerolag macd's will get very small or almost non-existant before a move. They can do this up to 4 time frames before the move or mostly right before the move. It is like the market suddenly gets quiet and no one is buying, then pow! So you can use this as another type of indicator to confirm the move is going to be good. As usual, no buy, sell or hold recommendations and you should always paper trade this first.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
And trade #10 on Cable yesterday. Just the 5min chart and 4h chart to show the enter fot those who are familiar with Philip Nel's 5min and 4h MACD system. I'll wait for a 21MA or 50SMA break on the 5min and on the 4H MACD a bounch of the 21MA. 20pips profit.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi: I guess my question would be directed to Pip Pirate 2 since it appears that you are the expert on this system. I am a very new trader. It appears like this is a system I can handle. I just want to comfirm something, We wait until the Blue and Pink lines cross and then wait for the white dotted line to go up and perferably above zero and then we enter a "buy" is that correct? Are all entries Buys or is there Short entries as well? Thanks Spent

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Welcome to the crazy and wild but we love it world of forex. As a new trader there are two parts to your answer. First I will answer your question. Look at the post #318 as a great example of the triple hull for the move long on the left side. Yes you want the pink and blue to cross but you also want all three dotted lines to be inside of the two lines. It is the shape of the triple is very important. I personally would not wait until it hits the zero line as you will miss most of the move. This system (as I hope you have read all the posts) is using several indicators to confirm the move. On this example the dynamic zone green line is looking very good as it has some distance from the blue line and has a good angle. Also the zerolag macd has a flat candle right before the move. So by looking at all of these indicators you can feel more confident. There are short trades also. Now for the second and most important part. If I could start over and be a newbie, this is what I would do. Trading is 90% mental. It's not having a great system it is how you think. Read all the books you can. Trading in the zone by Mark Douglas is a must. Trend Following by Michael Covel. Then read a book about candle formations like Candlestick Charting Explained by Morris. If you have a good library you can read for free all the books on trading even if they are about stock trading. Work on your thinking any way you can. Then I would paper trade for 6 months or more. Then do microlots where you invest $1 at a time. It sounds funny but it really matters. Remember this: once you have it figured out and then you make paper money for months in a row then get in. Take notes and start a journal where you write down the prices of many pairs and thoughts that you have. I have taken notes for years and what happens is that suddenly you will see a pattern or something will now make sense; and then you can go back over your notes to confirm your new idea. The challenge with forex is that news events happen only once a month so it takes many months to understand how it works. Please don't jump in too soon like most of us did. Most traders never make it because they trade real money too soon, lose it all and quit. Finally, realize that it will take you a few years to learn how to trade. You are a freshman going back to school. Remember, 95% of the population is going to retire broke. So if you want to be successful it is very easy; find out what everyone else is doing and do the opposite. Be ready to hear from friends that you are crazy and "are you making a million dollars yet". Don't listen. Read any successful person’s biography and it goes like this: struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, big struggle, struggle, BIG SUCCESS . See setbacks as proof of your future success. What makes anyone think that trading is any different?

My trade today after the NFP release. A. The Green line is coming out of the oversold area and crossed the blue line. My first criterion what I am looking for. B. lsma turned green and DX+ (blue) crossed the DX- upwards. Ideally I would like to see the lsma cutting in between the two lines like this one. C. ZeroLag turned to the upside (still struggling a bit to read/use this indicator) D. Triple showed a nice upward move with ---lines nicely between the two lines and crossing the 0 line. E. And a bounch of the daily pivot line. An entry on the previous candle would have given you another 12pips extra.

PP2 Well said - and it is really good advice. I am now busy with my 4th year in forex trading (only part time) and I've blown 2 mini accounts because I didn't have patience and didn't use money management principle. Now I am trading in mini lots once again using a mini account untill I feel comfortable with my system/s. Just look at my results for July Post #343 on previous page) and you'll see that I only trade 0.4 lots because my SL is around 15pips and my account is $500. I'll only risk 1.5% of my capital on any trade. I do have an excel spread sheet to determine the number of losts I can trade taking into account the SL in pips and capital in my account. It is very, very, very important. I can put on the thread if anyone is interested.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Yesterday my trade on $Y after the NFP. Almost the same as my EURJPY trade posted earlier on this page. I put a TP at 15pips and it just reached it before turning downwards. Only the ADX was not in line for this trade but I do like it when the green line of the Dynamic is coming out of the oversold area and crosses the blue line. Also on the Triple - both the blue and purple line are near the 10 line and have turned to show ut something is going to happen. Just look at how the purple is staying flat around the 0 line for the most of the day and the small candles on the ZeroLag - stay away.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
My trade today on cable - afterwards I've realised that after such a strong downward move, don't expect a bounch back. On the 4h chart there was a support line (nearby) that I've drawn and I though it will hold. Seems like it is holding but no bounch upward. My aim was the S1 pivot line - some 25pips away with a SL of 15pips. Counter trend trades are not that easy and one should be careful. Much easier when the market is "range bound" Just one of those trades - back to earth after Friday's run!!!!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
The trade on EURJPY: 30pips with first half and 90pips with second half = 60pips nett. My entry was way too late - ADX crossed in to between the -DX &amp; +DX could have been the signal. Also Triple's ---lines crossed the 0 line. I also could have waited for the price to bounch of the 21MA No 14 was just a few minutes after this trade on EUR$ and resulted in 10pips profit. Still on demo trading until I do get confident with this system. Even after results like this one still needs to practise.

Has anybody noticed that there is nothing we can call an ACTUAL cross of the RSi and Absolut Strength Histo??? This is just an eye illusion. Look at the data window and try to figure out....And that is the reason why an expert advisor cannot be written for this. If someone is using a wider screen and the other one smaller the crosses you claim happen at different candle times.... I have done this fault long before and was thinking I had found a good working solid strategy but at the end I realized it was a huge mistake...... Blue and the pink lines DO NEVER CROSS Correct me if I am wrong please...

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I have been working with this system for a few months and am no expert and definately not a computer expert at all. But maybe I can correct a few things and get you to see the bigger picture. First off the blue line is the RSI and the pink line is not a part of triple hull but LSMA. And I don't understand when you say they don't cross as they do dozens of times a day. Also I think anyone trying to write an expert advisor on this is wasting their time (just my opinion). It isn't necessary. As I have stated before, if you are very part time trading you can use this system with bigger time frames like H4 and Daily to make your pips. For daily traders like me it is excellent like it is. I couldn't trade today but have 4 positive trades, two break evens and no losses this month. Finally the look of the triple hull is way more important than any small details and you must use the dynamic and other indicators to confirm the trade anyway. You'd have to write an expert advisor for all the indicators. Why not paper trade like Golfer and just make pips? This system has changed my life and Blanca's too.

Start looking at post #296 and continue from there to the end. You will learn the new system and the rules for trading it.

Hi PP2 Thanks for the info. I had a Skype chat with Alexfot yesterday and suggested the very same. Now we are waiting for his charts and trades.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Thank you PP2 , I'll do that.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
A very interesting trade today after a strong uptrend. I took the odds on and took the short signal. My daily R2 was the aim and at one stage I thought it is not going to make it because of the lack of movement. The reason why I closed half my position after 13pips profit.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Another trade today but this time I decided that this one is not going anywhere. Look at Triple - purple line starting getting flat. I decided to take my 5pips profit and don't take on the odds. The 5min chart showed the same pattern -price moving up and down in a channel of about 8pips. Could go any direction now. But the price is still below the 50SMA - favour the short/down move.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Just to show what can happen in day trading - take your profits near pivot levels or the big numbers when it is there. Don't be gready! The downward move changed right on the next pivot level and move back to my orginal entry point.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
hi all i'm new to this, and i want to know where the complete rules and possible indicators fo this system ,please thx alot

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Look from post #296 on. Paper trade for a while.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I have been reading through the thread, and like what I see so far. I've tried some limited tests with the first Dollie system and it seemed to work pretty well. I'm just now going over the 2nd method, and will be testing that method over the next couple of weeks. I will keep you guys posted of my results. Thank you very much for all of your efforts and explanations so far, and thanks to Dollie for a great system. Ron.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hello all, I am able to load the first version of the Dollie system with no issues, but when I try to load the 2nd system template, it crashes MT4. No error message, just straight to the desktop. I've tried deleting all of the charts and only having one chart open with no templates or indicators on it, but as soon as I apply the 3a template or any of the other 3 templates, it crashes straight to the desktop. I tried to create the template myself, but I am very new to MT4 and I am not sure how to overlay the indicators in one single window. Any help would be appreciated Ron.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Must've been something wrong with my install, after a fresh install everything loads fine. Ron.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hi Ron Glad you've managed with the templates. Looking forward to see your charts and opinions/decisions.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Just an example of flat pink lines on the Tripli I saw today on EURU$. I highlighted with the rectangles. Nowhere to trade - so I decided to stay on the side line for the day.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
A trade on E$ with some indicators in line. I did enter under the arrow pointing down. Triple was just crossing the 0 line. Dynamic was coming out of the overbought area and ADX was crossed. From InterbankFX there is a GPS software available to identify price pattern. I saw the rising wegde pattern at the same time giving me a target as well. Then I went to the 5min chart and wait for the price to cross the 50MA - right belwo the arrow on the 5min chart. Close half my position after 20pips profit and move my SL to BE. I then activated a trailing SL of 15pips which was eventually triggered for another 41pips. Nett profit of 30.5pips.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Sorry to have to write this last message. I am tired of looking everyday on forex factory hoping that someone has made a new post on the success of this wonderful system. The triple hull (and other indicators, post #296) is excellent and I am more successful now than at any other time in my trading career. Looking for success stories from others. More important hoping that others have seen things that I haven't and are willing to share their ideas with others. Dollie began to be overwelmed early on in this post and so I took the lead to man the post and let her continue to develop new system and help others in other ways. Blanca came on and helped out with ideas and offered aid to me which I am forever in debt to her. So I shared my ideas and thoughts on how to make this system and the triple hull system better. I enjoy sharing and learning from others. I am not a great trader but trying to be a good student and helper. Trading is a lonely business and I yearn to reach out to others to share ideas and thoughts. So with no anger but mostly sadness that I say goodbye. I will continue to be on the forex factory forums somewhere and maybe start another post if I can find others who want to share.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Sorry to see you go Pip Pirate. I just found this thread and it is indeed an interesting read. Its unfortunate that good ideas die out so fast when the topics fall off the first page. golfer: could you please post your smma angle indicator? I have been looking for one similar to that but not able to find one yet.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I think you did an excellent job but you have to realize what people want. They want to see charts daily with successful trades so that they can believe they can do it also. Look at stochastics are sexy thread, gobs of charts explaining the concept. you need to post these charts daily and soon you will have more people asking (sometimes redundant questions) for information. They need to be constantly reinforced with the idea that this is so simple that they can do it also. If you take this step you will continue to attract people to your thread so you can continue helping, because you will learn more by doing this and explaining than just going to another thread. By doing this also you will keep the thread on the front page where people are more apt to see it. BTW I read this thread 3 time from beg to end and have had 6 successful trades in a row the last being 261 pips on the gbp/jpy (paper trading). This is a fantastic strategy. I normally don't post, but I though it worthwhile in this case. Keep the faith. terry

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I agree with tfrench! I'm sad that this topic is dying. A very good strategy and I think that we have to keep this post update and alive. Please Pip Pirate... don't go!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi Lep With pleasure. I hope this is what you want.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks to tfrench and others for the kind words. I really wasn't using that post as a cheap shot to get people to respond. I really thought that no one would write in as I see no posts for a week except Golfer. I can't be the only one who posts charts all the time as it takes too much time and I spend too much time on the computer as it is. Other people are going to have to contribute their successes otherwise this is "my" personal journal and I never wanted it to be that way. I tried to respect Dollie and Blanca and how they trade so that everyone should listen to them and do it their way. But now I am forced to let you all in on a little secret. The main reason I don't post charts all the time is that I dont' use the H1 time frame. I trade M15 and M5 charts and that is somewhat against the rules. Okay I have said it. The truth is out. I don't recommend everyone doing it (as I don't recommend any buy, sell or hold advice) but have found that the shorter time frames work better for me. As a new trader tho I would try to learn the H1 system as you will have long term better success. Scalping is dangerous to your money management. but for me it works. I do scalp to swing trades with this system. I'll look in on this post for the next few weeks but again Golfer and I can't be the only ones. Even if you just say hi I made some pips that would be great.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Ah, ty Golfer

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I have been following this thread since the beginning but never really got too involved because I to am a "scalper" and didn't want to get scolded!!! LOL I still use Dollies original setup (Absolute Strength, RSI, CCI &amp; LSMA) only. This system has allowed me to trade my way with more confidence. Don't get me wrong, if I'm in on a move on the 5min charts and its seems a strong trend is developing I switch to the 15min. I then switch to the 30min or 1hr charts if this persists.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi JC You are not alone - that is what I am doing as well. Dollie is one of my conformation system for direction. I'll try and look for a setup as described by PP2. Then I go to my 5min chart and wait for a pullback to my 21EMA or 50SMA to pull the trigger. I just couldn't find a nice setup lately (after 15H00GMT) and I don't trade just because one has to trade. The trade must come and look for me and not me looking for a trade! PP2 - don't give up. Last week I had the very same feeling but I kept posting. Hopefully it helps somebody or maybe it is because I am a university lecturer and just want to assist people.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I basically use the HMA indicator (set at 10). I will follow this and wait for this line to shoot up or down at a nice slope. Once this happens I refer to Dollies indicators. I try to make sure the RSI and Absolute Strength are at different extremes and the LSMA is cutting through the middle I scan all of the charts and wait for the best setups. Some days certain pairs are just flat. Attached is the HMA indicator along with a nice 10pip move I just got on the NZDUSD cross this afternoon.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
here is a trade I just scored on the usd/cad cross. Again, I scan many pairs and wait for a setup that I think is prime. see attached

--- 帖子 #381 ---
here are 3 pairs I just scalped: NZDUSD - USDCAD - AUDUSD using Dollies indicators as my base.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I have added 2 filters to this system. You don't have to. The first indicator box is Momentum (20) and RSI (10). I don't go long unless both of these are over the 100 line and don't go short unless these are both under the 100 line. The other indicator box is a trend indicator. It is attached for those who want it. I use this sometimes as an indicator to go short. I don't know if it is just me but I feel Dollies indicators often get you into short positions late. I think it has to do with the Absolute Strength indicator. This is where the trend indicator comes in. If the HMA is purple and sloping downward at a good angle and the Momentum and RSI are both under the 100 line and the LSMA is RED and Sloping downward at a good angle I will now refer to the Trend indicator. If the purple line is above 4 then I will enter a short position. I am going to papertrade this method until I become fully confident that the Trend Indicator is strong enough base short trades off of. Attached are two good examples that could have netted 27 pips off the yen.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I just scalped another 10 pips from the aussie/us cross. see attached.... This system works for any timeframe. It is just my personality that makes me scalp. I can't place a trade and walk away from my computer with a stop loss and take profit set and then check the charts an hour later and see where I am at.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
the attached chart is the following 15min from the previous post. As you can see the price completely whipsawed and if I decided to stay in I would have had a losing trade. The moral of the story... don't get greedy if you scalp. Take your 10 pips and run. I am going to bed now (2:00 am EST).

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I see that you are successful and seem to like the aud and cad pairs. I too have been studying them since I started trading. Just a FYI: You might want to check out the eur/aud and eur/cad instead of the aud/usd and usd/cad. If your broker doesn't have these pairs, shame on them. They move an average of 100 pips a day and with the news events of the two countries you will get better action. Set up a demo account at Interbankfx just to watch it. The news events to watch for the aud pairs are unemployment and retail sales, which come out around the first week of the month. You may find that for the 24 hours after the event, there can be several moves to make some pips. Thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi PP2 Just to say welcome back, PP2. I know you cannot just leave a winning system like Dollie alone!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Thanks for the suggestion. I will look into the Eur/Aud pair. My charting platform (strategybuilderfx) doesn't have the Eur/Cad pair. I usually trade from 8pm - 3am Eastern Time. The first thing I do is look at the previous days movements on all the pairs. I choose 4 or 5 that I determine to be most volatile and those are the crosses I will concentrate on. If one of these didn't get any action then I substitute it the next day.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I just scalped 24 pips from the dollar, euro, aussie Yen crosses. As I type this these pairs are still going short. I guess I am too impatient. LOL

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I thought that I had forgotten how to post charts but it looks like forex factory has decided to make our charts very small. Here is the chart I tried to post yesterday. You will have to zoom your page to see it. The arrows all show what are good signals from the indicators. Not the biggest move but I wanted to show the indicators and how they are supposed to look.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I see on your charts you are using momentum 15. Is this standard??? thanks

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I have been switching between 20 &amp; 15 as my setting. I think I am going to go more with the 20 settings as it gives me a little more idea of the overall trend.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I just scored on 116 pips off the dollar, euro, aussie YEN crosses. I stayed in longer then usual because purple line (absolute strength) was staying level at the bottom of the chart telling me the trend was going to continue.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Has anyone else noticed that the dow jones and yen pairs are running together and the dow seems to influence how the yen moves? I am on the west coast of US so it is early for me but I have been tracking how the yen reacts before the stock market opens. So if you can watch the yen pairs (gbp/jpy for me) from 12 GMT to 13:28 GMT and let me know what you all see. this has been happening since March.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi all: I found the post with a tpl attachment. I loaded it but it dosen't have the lsma 3 line. I downloaded the lsma indicator but I can't figure out how you overlay it. I can add it as a stand alone indicator but can't get it on the same indicator box as the rest. Would appreciate any help with this. Thanks Spent1

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi Spent1 I've just downloaded all the files on page 20 of the thread (both posts) from PP2 and open the template - no problems. Have you tried the attachments on page 20?

My outcome for Aug 2007 using Dollie on a demo account. The last week or two I was busy with other systems and didn't really trade Dollie. In Sept I'll try and be more active with it.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Here is one of the reasons for taking a look at the Eur/Aud. Here is the move before the AUD unemployment news event. You will see this sometimes that the pair will be active before and after the news event for 24 hours. Here is what you could have done before the event. Good reason to get out before the event because the pair went short with the news. Great look of the indicators. This is a 15 min chart. Triple told you to look for the move. Dynamic was next saying this looks good. Flat macd is another great sign and then the ADX has the green go through the two lines. What more do you want? This pair moved 70-90 pips max.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi. I've followed this thread as the system developed, and I'm a bit disappointed that interest seems to have faded away, as I'm of the opinion that this is one of the best methods I've seen. I've seen how different people use Dollie's method, so I thought I'd add my example just to see if it will inspire others to once again post their methods. Anyway, as you can see the example below, I'm using a 5m chart with Dollie's basic method in the window below, and adding the Dynamic Zone RSI below that. The surprise is in the main chart window, as you can see, because I've added a Guppy MMA to it! I like Guppy's method, and maybe it's just me, but I think it's a very useful addition to the Dollie method. Look at the first yellow line which is where the green line crosses up over the blue, with the added strength of crossing the red dotted middle band as well. In the window above, everything seems to be crossing the zero line in the right directions at once, so all we have to do now is wait for the lsma to get into the orange/blue zone. I didn't enter there, because the LT band of the Guppy was still trying to complete its turnover, plus, price was getting very near the M2 line. I waited until the open of the candle under the blue arrow, as by then, the Guppy ma's were widening nicely. As you can see, the RSI2 dipped twice under the zero line and the lsma, but I let it ride because the ST Guppy ma's were steady, plus the LT Guppy was still widening. Trusting the Guppy paid off, as I exited the trade just before the second yellow line, as the lsma was leaving the orange/blue zone, plus the price was getting very near the Pivot line. All in all, around 40 pips gained from a Dollie/Guppy combination. On Demo of course, because it'll take a bit of testing before going live. So I'll wait and see, but it looks promising.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Another nice trade on GBP/USD just now, and is a good example of profiting from using one's patience. Again, the vertical yellow line signals the impending trade, just about the same time as the RSI2/CCI is crossing the zero line, with the ASI already crossed and heading down. The Guppy then makes us wait before showing us the approx. right time to enter. The blue arrow shows the entry candle (ST Guppy ma's starting to widen, and price above the M2 line), and by this time, the green line in the DZR window has punched its way through the upper orange band, indicating strength in the price movement. Once again, the Pivot Point showed me the gangplank, which I very gratefully used to jump ship! Another 45 pips all told. It might look as if I left a lot of pips on the table back at the yellow vertical line. This is true, but I look upon this as necessary if one wants to trade the high-probability chances that come along. Still, each to his own.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi Eyev Don't worry, I am still here. Just didn't have time to trade this setup. I am also looking at the previous version of Dollie - just like you. I am looking at when the Isma crossed into the zone (Arrow A) with the blue line above the pink line) and the ---- line also entering the zone (arrow B). Also waiting for it to cross the 0 line. Dollie told me that when the two lines are in the zone, one/a trade is pretty save. At arrow C the two lines are leaving the zone - no more trades. Now I will also look at the Dynamic indicator for confirmation. I also want to combine this 30min chart with a 5min system as well as 4h system (the other systems we are following) for confirmation. But still working on it.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Just another random example taken. What I would like to see is the Dynamic coming out of overbought/oversold area (bullet A) and then we get the cross of Isma line and ---line into the zone with the blue and pink line in position. Once again get out when the lines leave the zone or when --- enter the other overbought/oversold area (arrow B). Accoring to Dollie you can even wait for the Isma indicator to enter the other overbought/oversold area. Just my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Nice to be in touch again, mate. Good looking charts, my friend, with excellent logic accompanying them! I guess that we all find our own ways of using these methods, and to be honest, I think that's half the fun! I posted mine mainly to try and stimulate some more interest in the thread, because it's been an excellent thread. It was interesting looking at the scalping angle practiced by jcblcs79, on recent posts, and that's what it's all about really. It's the only way to learn, wouldn't you agree? I haven't been on the 5minIntraday for quite a while, mate, but it's still a pretty active thread, last time I looked. Take care, mate, and I hope you enjoyed your break. Cheers

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Nearly bedtime over here in the UK, and I'm just browsing around before heading off for some zeds, and have a look at what I saw! The vertical yellow line indicates the heads-up quickly followed by a cross of the red dotted line. At the same time, the RSI2 crosses the zero line, quickly followed by the CCI6. The lsma is just about into the orange/blue zone, signifying an immediate entry, seeing as the price is just above the M2 line with a clear 49 pips until the Pivot Point! However, once it gets up there, we can see that the Guppy is looking VERY healthy, so let's just let it ride and see what happens. Result? A lovely ride all the way up to the M3 line with a potential profit of 140 pips! In this case, the lsma indicated precisely where to exit, just as the green line was crossing back over the blue down in the bottom window. The Guppy, in this example, was probably an interested bystander, but the visual effect of those lovely spreading ma's can only serve to give one more confidence in the trade! The one that got away!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Glad to see someone else posting on the board. I have been working on my own challenges lately so not much to post. Man Eyevoltage do I wish I was in the U.K. right now! I dream about it every day. Being able to trade the euro session and making 100's of pips a week. Trying to figure out how to come over from California for a month, live really cheaply but with high speed internet and just trade my brains out. I will do it within a year. Then come back and forth and write the trip off my taxes as a business trip. Much stop now as I will go on forever. Continued success.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
hi all in which page i can find the complete rules of this system ? thx

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Start on the first page and read every post. You won't regret it, I promise! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Thanks for the welcome, mate. I guess that the UK's the place to be as far as trading is concerned. I'm not sure, but I'm assuming that it would be better for you in the States if you were on the Eastern seaboard rather than the West? Pacific area traders (Far East, Australia, NZ etc.) seem to have to get up at some very strange hours in order to catch the good moves. I hope you make your trip, my friend, and pick up some great trades whilst you're over here. Take care Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Just to show you the 4 possible trades with the "old" Dollie resulting in 60pips - just remember you won't catch them all: 1. The "x" is where the pink and the blue lines crossed giving me the indication of the movement. 2. If blue crosses the pink line to the upside (blue above pink), then the Isma should come from below (the arrows pointing up)and enter the zone indicating a long trade on the opening of the next candle. 3. If pink crosses the blue line to the upside (pink above blue), then Isma should come from above (the arrows pointing down) and enter the zone indicating a short trade on the opening of the next candle. Hope it make sense. Thanks Dollie for the system. Hope you are still with us (don't see you on Skype anymore) and that you enjoy trading Cable with your "hunderds" of MAs.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
What do I mean "in the zone"? Look at the red horizontal and ellipse on the following two charts. That is where Isma is entering and exiting the area between blue and pink line.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
thx alot

--- 帖子 #411 ---
You're entirely welcome, old chap! Cheers

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Another trade in the old-fasion Dollie Style. Blue has crossed the pink line ("c") to be on top indicating a possible long trade. After that Isma and ---- lines are crossing into the zone ("A") meaning we can now enter a long trade. The zone area is marked with the ellipse. The Dynamic is also coming out of the oversold area and is crossing the blue line ("B"). Great setup. Exit is when Isma is entering the overbought area or when it leaves the zone or near pivot line. Result 30pips.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
An even better trade this morning - I've just put in the entry and exit points. People can now look for themselves at the indicators and decide why one should enter and exit at that levels.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hey Willem. Nice charts, and isn't it amazing how everything seems to drop nicely into place with this system? I liked the last example you posted, when all the signs were saying "BUY!!", but you demonstrated the value of patience by waiting for the Pivot Point to be breached. Spot on, mate, and just what I would have done. I really do like this system, especially using the original indicator window along with the Dynamic. It's a powerful duo! By the way, do you always use 30m, or do you vary things a little on this system? Cheers

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I wonder, how "safe" these trades are. What is mostly the risk ratio, how many pips on average? Even 10 pips would be fine, if very safe. Any comments?

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Sorry if I don't give you a set answer. The bigger the time frame, the more potential for bigger pips. Also you then need to set a bigger stop loss. Since I haven't seen you on the post before, the answer to most questions is paper trade for a least a month or two. I personally have had a problem letting the trade form and not get out too early if it goes against me. What pair and what time of day are very important to seeing what the risk ratio is. During the major sessions you will see the best results. Heads up for the group: I am not scalping anymore but moving to the 4hr time frame. Blanca has shown me that it works and the one with the biggest pip pile is the one I want to follow (and her pile is way bigger). Read any successful person’s biography and it goes like this: struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, big struggle, struggle, BIG SUCCESS . See setbacks as proof of your future success. What makes anyone think that trading is any different?

hi all how should we use dunamic zone? thx

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Wait for the green line to cross the blue line. Also make sure that the RSI2 and CCI6 have crossed the zero line, and the Absolute Strength has crossed in the opposite direction. You can enter the trade as the lsma3 enters the zone created by the RSI2/CC6 and the Absolute Strength Indicator. For me, that's the best way to start with this system. Later on, you may find ways of your own to vary things a bit, once you've got used to it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #420 ---
A lovely example this morning on Cable of everything falling into place, giving what would have been a very satisfactory result. Unfortunately, I was still fast asleep in bed! Starting in the Dynamic Zone, we see the green RSI line crossing the blue MA. This cross was already above the red dotted middle zone, which was a very positive sign. Slightly before the yellow vertical line, the green RSI then crossed above the orange upper zone, effectively telling us all to "get in NOW!!" Just after the yellow vertical line, we see the lsma3 in the middle window crossing into the orange/blue zone. All good signals promising a nice trade. As I like to utilize the Guppy MMA method into the Dollie system, I would have waited until I could see evidence of a separation of the ST and LT ma's, with a positive upward movement of the the ST ma's before opening a trade at the first yellow arrow. The second yellow arrow indicates the exit, smack on the R2 line, giving a profit of 37 pips. Not bad for 20 minutes "work"! If only I hadn't been asleep!

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Here's another nice example of my method of trading this system. It was around the same time as my last example, and you can see the three vertical yellow lines showing the rapid crossing of the green RSI line from the lower zone before breaching the upper zone. Whilst this is going on, we see in the middle window everything proceeding nicely again until the lsma3 once again crosses into the orange/blue zone. The M3 line is the penultimate barrier to the trade, with Guppy MMA again giving the final "nudge" to get in. The R1 line would have been a good place to exit, giving a profit of 19 pips. What a nice simple logical method Dollie has given us, and for me, the icing on the cake is the Guppy MMA. As you can see, I'm using the 5m TF, but the whole thing works in any TF as far as I can see.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi Eyev Great setup, what a beauty - even for a 5min chart. Well, we do need some sleep and plenty more to come. Keep it going!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I caught this one just after I got up this morning. Mostly, at times like that, one just misses opportunities like this one, but not this time! It was a lovely pull-back situation which stalled at the S2 line (Yellow vertical). The Guppy MMA LT's were still wide open and headed downwards, whilst the Dynamic Zone Indicator had the green RSI ready to cross the blue MA line. However, look in the middle window and see how everything's coming together at once. The RSI2/CC6 are both crossing down through the zero line at the same time as the Absolute Strength is rising through it. I entered as the candle was passing through the LT 30ema (2.0114) and was about to exit at the close of the next candle, but actually ended up exiting at the open (2.0089) of the next one after that. Result: A fairly respectable 22 pip profit for around 15 minutes of "work". Just out of interest, you'll probably see that there was another pull-back situation just before the trade that I took. Well, quite apart from the fact that I was still in bed, I wouldn't have took it anyway. The reason is that the whole move straddled the S2 line, making it a riskier trade than the one described above. Also, the lsma3 didn't enter the orange/blue zone until the move was nearly over. As it happened, it ended up with a decent result, but I make a habit of respecting pivot levels and only enter trades such as the one above, which give a clear risk/reward indication.

I missed this one unfortunately, as I was preoccupied with something else, but again, it's a nice example of how the different indicators compliment one another. Again, the heads-up was given by the green line crossing the blue one down in the DZ window. In the middle window, the RSI had already crossed the zero, with the ASI crossing down 5 minutes later. The CCI6 followed the RSI up through the zero 5 minutes after that, but the Guppy MMA wasn't looking too promising, plus the S2 line was very close. However, just after the lsma3 entered the orange/blue zone, a candle punched through the S2 line, with the Guppy ST MMA's starting to separate. Perfect. My entry would have been as indicated at 2.0122, a comfortable position with the R/R in mind. After the close of the first candle of the trade, a doji formed and then another. The second one was a Gravestone doji which formed just under the M1 Line....a good place to exit, under the circumstances. So the exit at 2.0138 would have meant a useful profit of 13 pips. For me, I can't overstate the value of Pivot lines....they come up trumps time after time. Also, closely watching the different types of candles that appear is something that can nearly always prove beneficial to your trading.

Your comments much appreciated, Willem. I seem to be more comfortable with the 5m charts than longer TF's on this method. I don't know why....just seems to be a case of not too long and not too short! Anybody else going to post a chart or two, I wonder? Cheers

I was otherwise engaged today, so no time to trade. However, I've just been browsing through the day's activity, and spotted these examples. In the vertical channel 1, the green line crosses the blue at the same time as the lsma3 enters the orange/blue zone. The RSI2/CC6 had already done the business by crossing the zero line, so my entry would have been under the yellow arrow. It's pretty obvious from the Guppy MMA LT ma's that there's a nice gentle uptrend in residence, so it would have been a confident entry. In addition, the R/R situation is pretty good, with the M3 line the target for exit. However, the price managed to pierce the M3 line, with another strong candle following just as the lsma3 was leaving the orange/blue zone. A good exit signal, leaving a potential profit of 24 pips. The second possibility in the 2nd vertical channel seems pretty clear cut. Except for the price being too near the M3 line. Everything seems good to go in the 2 lower windows, but that pesky M3 line would have stopped me entering the trade. The Guppy MMA is saying "GO"!!, but the M3 is saying "NO"!! Well, as Dirty Harry used to say: "You gotta ask yourself, do you feel lucky?"

Here's a chart for you. This is why I am switching to the H4 charts. Now the GBP/JPY has been channeling and I plan on getting some of this. I am still perfecting this system. Here is a lesson for all the new people: I have been studying this system since the beginning. But since I am now trying a new time charts for me (and finally listening to Dollie), I am paper trading and copying charts in Microsoft word to study this weekend. I am not going to trade live until I have a better understanding of the moves. There is no reason to rush. but it won't be long....

What does your triple hull consist of?

Eyevoltage - thank you for your charts and comments. They have helped my Dollie trading significantly.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
My pleasure, mate. Good luck with your trading. Cheers

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Good luck with the 4H charts, mate. Personally, that's far too long a period for me, but each to their own. Your charts are, of course, different from mine in various ways, regardless of the TF. However, I think that this goes to prove what a superbly versatile method Dollie has given us. I often wonder what people think after they've posted a good method, and then watch as other members of the forum take it apart, kick it around and then finish up with either improving it, or making it that complicated it's just not worth the hassle anymore. A case in point was a while ago, when Sidus presented the forum with a nice system that was simple and straight to the point. That thread grew into a monster, with everybody piling in, suggesting changing this and changing that, until, in my opinion, it got out of control. I hope that doesn't happen with Dollie's method. There's a lot to be said for keeping things nice and simple, I'm sure you'll agree. Good luck, pirate, and I look forward to seeing some more of your excellent charts. Cheers

Hi, Ia not new to forex, but I just register for a demo on meta trader. Dont know how to build charts or to import orcopy your indicators from the files you have put in the thread. Can anyone help without sending me to university? Please, much appreciated.

Check this one out. A lovely combination of indicators all "playing in tune", so to speak. The green crosses the blue AND the lower zone simultaneously, whilst in the middle window, three indicators all meet at the zero line on their way up and down. So then it was just a case of waiting for the lsma3 to cross into the orange/blue zone, which it obliged with three periods later. I entered the trade there, without waiting for the Guppy MMA to start rising. The reason was that the Guppy LT showed no sign of narrowing or changing direction, plus, price was just above the R1 line, giving an excellent R/R situation. When price was just below R2, I thought about exiting the trade, but Guppy was starting to look REALLY up for it, plus the ASH in the middle window was starting to dip into the OS area. Consequently, I let the trade run for a while. It was the dragonfly doji forming just as the lsma3 showed signs of exiting the orange/blue zone that prompted my exit. 27 pips in the bank. I'm liking this Dollie/Guppy combination more and more, not least because of the highly "visual" effect that's hard to miss.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
My advice would be to go the section of this Forum that deals exclusively with MT4. Spend some time on that section, reading all the threads, whilst just playing around with the MT4 charts. Don't even think about trying to trade until you're thoroughly familiar with the MT4 platform. Read, watch, study and learn. It'll pay dividends, I promise you. Good luck, mate. Cheers

Hi Eyevoltage, Would you be able to post your template and indicator combination so I can replicate your beauty of a chart set-up. Looks like this could give some nice moves on volatile pairs whilst waiting for the hourly candles.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
No, Currently sitting in a spare room in Shrewsbury, eyevoltage has the right football team, just want his chart setup as well and then hopefully do a better job than our team did last night. Alex wasn't happy

Hi Scorpion and Ironball. What can I say? Your wish is my command! I'm not sure if I can send them all at once, so to be sure, I'll split the posts. First of all, I don't have an indicator for the Guppy. I use one I made up directly on the chart. Here's what I use: Short Term: 3 5 8 10 12 15 (All ema) 3 to 12 is Olive Drab, and 15 is Gold. Long Term: 30 35 40 45 50 55 (All ema) 30 is Dodger Blue, 35-50 is Red, and 55 is Dark Turquoise. So you'll have to put them all on the chart yourselves, I'm afraid. (Oh, do I have to? Yes, I'm afraid you'll have to! ) Indicators are: CCI (6), Absolute Strength Histogram V2, RSI 2 and the lsma3 for the middle window. Dynamic Zone RSI (14,20,5) in the bottom window. In addition, I use the MultiplePivot V2 indicator in the main chart window. Cheers

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi again. I believe the crowd last night for a Carling Cup game was around 74,000, which rather puts to shame Chelsea's 24,000 for a Champions League game the other week!! Anyway, back to business. Here's the Dynamic Zone RSI and, if you want it, the MultiplePivot V2. Not everybody uses Pivots, but I wouldn't be without them. I don't think I've left anything out, but I'm sure you'll let me know if I have! By the way, in case you're wondering, I've included the .ex4 and the .mq4 files together, as I'm not certain if you need them both or not. So, to be on the safe side, load them all into the relevant file. Perhaps some kind soul could enlighten me as to the significance of the different suffixes? Best of luck, guys. Cheers

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Thanks eyevoltage, I see you have been checking out other 5 min strats, are you currently concentrating on this one. I watched this thread when dollie first started it but sad to say looked away to other areas but now I have a 60m set-up I am happy with and am ready to look again for a 5 min strategy for the in-between times, especially on things like the GBPJPY. Apart from the trades you have posted what other experiences have you had with the system (good or bad). Thanks again for your help with the template.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
What is your "starting point" for looking for a trade, obviously you can't watch all the indicators at once, is there one thing you look at and say "this may be a trade setting up"

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Yeah, I tend to stick to ST trades, mate. 15m would be the highest I would go, but I like the 5m charts and occasionally even down to the 1m. I liked PhilNet's 5mIntraday system. There was a lot more to it than met the eye, and it kinda forced one to look for the high-probability trades instead of jumping in every time there was a pull-back, so to speak. I also like the Cornflower method.....not so much for the 1H charts, but I love to try scalping on the 5m Cornflower, using lever70's 5m MA's. As for Dollie's system....I didn't really take to it when I first came across it. It seemed too much like hard work, keeping an eye on that middle window and all that was going on in there. However, I came back to it after a while, re-read the whole thread, and decided to try it again. I wasn't having a lot of success with Dollie's new method, so I reverted to the original one, but took the Dynamic Zone from the new one with me. That improved things, but still didn't seem quite "right", somehow. I tried various indicators and discarded them, until, just for a laugh really, I tried adding the Guppy, and was immediately struck at how it gave so much more of a visual indication of where price was likely to be headed. I don't usually like to use a lot of indicators as it only leads to confusion, but this particular combination seems simple to keep one's eye on, somehow. What I call my "heads-up" of a possible development is the crossing of the green RSI line over the blue MA line in the bottom window. If it then crosses the middle red dotted band as well, it's looking good. I then look at the middle window to see what's happening in there, and if the various indicators look as if they're heading where I think they SHOULD be heading, then it's finger on the button time. Guppy, in combination with Pivot lines, usually shows me quite clearly where my potential entry point is, and the same combination is used for exits as well. So far, it's come up trumps with only the odd loser, but even then, it's usually down to me not reading the signs properly. Best of luck with it, mate. Cheers

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I have no idea what the triple hull indicator consists of, as Dollie is the master creator of the indicators. I don't have a clue how to make an indicator. I simply follow what she gives all of us. You can go to post #296 and get all the new indicators. Good luck to you and all

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I'm glad to see the thread is still going. I recently moved and have had problems getting on FF (my firewall was set too high and I couldn't figure it out.) I have actually been using the 1 min charts recently. I still use the original Dollie RSI, ASH and LSMA settings along with 2 other indicators. I'm going to start posting these tomorrow with some charts. People think I'm crazy for scalping but I guess it is just my personality. I guess I love the rush I get while being in these trades!!!

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Check this little beauty out. Green line crosses blue at the same time as the lsma3 crosses into the orange/blue zone. I got in on the candle at the yellow vertical. Just look at those small candles finding support along the yellow 15ema in Guppy just above the Pivot line, giving a really nice R/R. I have to admit that I didn't expect two very strong candles to appear, but Guppy was saying to me that an upward move was imminent, so in I went. My target was the M3 line, but I thought it would take a bit longer than it did! The outcome of this is a nice 37 pip profit. Whilst I'm on here, I have to apologize to Dollie for not thanking her for this amazing system. Thank you for sharing this with us, Dollie......it takes one's breath away sometimes!

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi Eye, Thanks for your help yesterday, to return the favour, if you put the crossover indicator on the chart and set it to 3335 it gives you the "heads up" points you were talking about yesterday, you then don't need to strain to check the DZ crosses, you can just wait for the arrows on the candles and then when one appears check the DZ and Dollie. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
This trade required some patience. As you can see, after my last trade, the price started testing the resistance offered by yesterday's high (yellow arrows). So when I saw the green cross the blue in the bottom window, I realized I'd have to wait a little. Price was literally "trapped" between yesterday's high and the M3 line, so it was a case of waiting to see if the YH line would be breached. The first red arrow indicates where I entered the trade, as it opened on the YH line at 2.0289. I have to say that my entry candle plus the previous one didn't fill me with confidence, due to the rather large upper shadows, signifying Bear pressure. Still, Guppy was looking healthy, so I decided to try for R1. Eventually, the Gravestone doji just under R1 got me scrambling to jump ship, but I was a little late in doing so, getting out at 2.0310 for a profit of 18 pips after spread. A nice little trade and another good example of how it pays to use pivots, S/R lines and recognize the subtle messages that the candles are sending out. Scorpion, thanks for your comments, but I'm not clear which "crossing" indicator you're on about? Can you clarify, if you don't mind?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
This is my last one for the day, rounding off a pretty good session. Once again, the green crossed the blue, just as everything was coming together at once in the middle window. I didn't enter right then, as price was down in the LT ma's of Guppy. Perhaps I should have taken it, as yesterday's high was proving to be a solid support. I entered instead at the opening of the next candle which was based on the Guppy ST 15ema. The R1 line was quite close above, but with Guppy ST's spreading the way they were, I thought it was worth waiting to see what happened. Once again, Guppy showed the way, and I finally exited at the spinning top candle for 32 pips, just as the lsma3 was preparing to leave the orange/blue zone. Dollie, bless you. Mr.Guppy, you're a star.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Yet another beautiful example of this remarkable method/system. Unfortunately, all I could do was keep track of this one, as I was busy with other things, and couldn't give it my full attention. Once again, the green/blue cross in the lower window provides the heads-up. Everything was looking good in the middle window, and the first yellow arrow indicates where I would have entered. The reason for entering there is the slight widening of the Guppy ST's plus the candle's solid base on the yellow 15ema, not to mention the lsma3's entry into the orange/blue zone. My target would have been R1, but as you can see, by the time it reached there, Guppy was showing real strength, so I probably would have left it to run with my finger on the button ready for anything untoward. As soon as that spinning top appeared just above the R1 line, I would have been out, even though the Guppy remained looking really good. Not long after, the lsma3's exit from orange/blue zone proved that the decision would have been a good one.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi eye, As you say, another nice example, I must admit I tend to forget to look at the CCI these days, the guppy is much more important, I think I will take it off of the indicator window, what are your thoughts. Does it ever stop you entering a position.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi Scorpion. I've been reading through Dollie's original instructions, and she says that when the CCI6 moves through the zero, it signifies a safe trade. I've also been looking at past charts, and it seems as if CCI6 crosses the zero line in very close proximity to the RSI2. Sometimes lagging, sometimes leading and sometimes right at the same time. Also, Dollie says that she likes to see the CCI6 enter the orange/blue zone, just like the lsma3. Let's face it, she developed this system, and it's been developed still further, and all in all, regardless of whether one stays with the original format, or goes with the modernised format, it's been remarkably accurate at pin-pointing potential trades. After experimenting, I found that adding the DZRSI and the Guppy made it even better for me, so that's the way I went. However, I'm reluctant to take away anything that Dollie found important in her original concept. I guess, in the end, it's down to the individual, mate. In other words, if it works for you, then go for it. I don't think the CCI6 by itself has ever influenced my decisions, mate; I just like to see it in there closely mirroring the blue RSI line. I hope that clarifies the situation for you, mate. Oh, and by the way, I did ask what you meant by a certain "crossover" indicator you mentioned, but you never replied. I'd be grateful if you could clear that up for me, mate. Cheers

USD/JPY has been pretty good today. I usually just watch Cable, but it just shows, it can pay to keep an eye on at least one other pair. (Or, rather, it can if you're live, which I wasn't. I was just an interested observer, as I was still busy with something else). The first trade shows a good entry with decent R/R as lsma3 enters the orange/blue zone, and an exit just below the R2 line. With the second one, the entry would have been ok (green line crossing blue AND red lines almost at once.......lsma3 already in orange/blue zone), but the exit's a bit haphazard really. Was it because of the blue RSI2 and the lsma3 crossing up into the OB zone? Who can say? I'll bet that gap down soon afterwards caused some feathers to fly, though!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Fellow pipsters: I have been studying something lately (as I am always thinking about trading and how to get better) with the HMA color indicator. I don't know if you use it with Dollie's Triple system. Blanca gave it to me and I was noticing something. This is only with the H1 and H4 charts. When the HMA changes color (meaning the direction is going to change), it seems that the trend is going to go on for many candles. So if you get in near the beginning of the move, and can handle the ups and downs, there seems to be a positive trade with a profit target. I am testing this now and wonder if anyone else noticed this. The rules are: It must be a pair that moves a lot, the time of the trend change (color change on HMA) must be at an active time for that pair, and set a profit target of 20-50 pips. I'll test it and report. Am using it at the beginning of the euro session and US.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Is the HMA Color indicator also good for smaller time frames (15mins) or is it repainting and thats why useless?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I have used it on the smaller time frames but as you can guess, it is not as reliable. The rules above still apply but know that you don't have that many time frames within a 4 candle move. I have been trying to stay away from the smaller moves and trading less but for more pips. As always, paper trade for a month or so.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Just and example how a 5min and Dollie system could be combined. First Dollie will give a signal when Isma enter the zone (between pink and blue line). Then one can go to the 5min chart and wait for a entry signal. That happens at 2.0386 with pullback into the war zone (for those familiar with Phillip 5min intra-day system). Any 5min system can by used (CF or Guppy like Eyevoltage). Exit when Isma exit the zone or enter the opposite overbought/sold area. In this case 20pips profit. The next long signal didn't really give an entry signal on the 5min chart. But if one enters long at the opening of the first candle after Isma has entered the zone (another method to enter), 15pips was on the table.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I've had a quick look at this one, mate, and I like it better using the Cornflower 5m chart, using lever70's MA's for that TF. I've noticed that once or twice there isn't a great difference in entry points, but on the other hand, sometimes one would have to wait a while before the opportunity for entry crops up. Just to confirm. It's just a matter of waiting for the pull-back and then jumping in, right? How on earth do you get the time to lecture, when your mind's busy making these little schemes up? Nice one, pal. Cheers

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Woodcrusher: Here is a great example of the 15 min charts and why Dollie's system is so great. This move was at the open of the US stock market. This is why you want to use many indicators, not just one.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Is there anybody there? Knock once for yes........... I really can't believe that Dollie's excellent "safe pip provider" isn't getting a better response. Posts come in fits and starts, then everything goes quiet again. My particular method of using Dollie's system continues to come up with opportunities on all TF's, but my favourite is the 5m one, especially when it comes up with one like this from this morning. The DZ gave the first indication at the same time as the RSI2/CCI6 was crossing the zero line. I've found that on short trades, the lsma3 is habitually late in giving an entry signal, so I've switched my attention to the CCI6, which, when it's in the orange/blue zone, gives an earlier entry point. However, I preferred to wait for the Pivot Point to be breached, and the first yellow arrow shows my eventual entry. A lovely Guppy cross and spread of MA's gave me further encouragement and price just dropped like a stone. My exit was prompted by the simultaneous cross of CCI6 and lsma3 out of the orange/blue zone. 55 pips can't be bad for less than half-an-hour's work, can it?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I didn't actually trade this one, as I was busy elsewhere, but I probably wouldn't have traded it, anyway. Still, I thought I'd post it, as it's a good example of a "bucking the trend" sort of trade. Really, I suppose it's a high-risk trade, and not something I would recommend. However, each to his own. There was a good signal from the DZ just after a nice downward move. Entry, as shown, would have been above the S2 line, as the CCI6 crossed the zero line into the orange/blue zone. A gradual climb ensued until price peaked just inside the Guppy ST MA's before starting to fall again. Exit would have been as marked at the second yellow arrow, just as the CCI6 was leaving the orange/blue zone, and RSI2 was starting to drop from an OB position. A possible 34 pips for less than an hour of one's time, but as I said, trading against the trend can be very high-risk.

Hey eyevoltage: I am always looking at the board several times a day, hoping that it doesn't die. but as I said before, I am trying to change my trading ways to the longer time frames. It's hard after a few years of scalping. Good luck and many pips to you eye and those that can do it but I have to change for me. Here is one that I can't believe I missed twice. This system is great if you do it. This is almost 300 pips. Triple hull told us it was coming, we got flat macd's right before the move and then the adx was good on the last move. What more do we want?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I think there's only you and me keeping this thread going, mate. Like I said before, this method is so good and incredibly versatile; I just can't understand why more people don't stay around, unless they're too busy making money, that is! I liked your chart, mate, and whenever I see a "new-method" chart like yours, I always say I'm going to have a go and see what happens. Let's face it, there's nothing complicated about it. Just spend a little time getting used to the different indicators and what they're doing, whilst watching them in action. It's not rocket science, is it? I notice that your chart is a 1H one, pirate. So I take it that you're swapping back and forth between 1H and 4H, would that be right? Personally, the longest TF I'd use is 1H, but I'm mostly a 5m/15m sort of bloke. There's absolutely no way I'd get involved with 4H charts or longer. I guess I just like to see what's going on during the time I have for trading, preferring to open and close positions there and then, sort of thing. Would you post your charts on a more regular basis, pirate? To keep the thread going, but mostly because it's all instructive, and the more charts we see, the better we understand what's going on! By the way, are you any nearer to getting yourself over here in the near future, or is that still a pipe-dream? Cheers for now, mate.

This is two opportunities in quick succession. The first one I thought was a bit "iffy", so I didn't enter. One has to be happy with the position, otherwise it's a strict no-no. As you can see, after the 1st yellow vertical, it took around 45 minutes before an entry would have been possibly feasible. The reasons for this are: The Guppy not fully developed yet, plus successive candles testing the resistance of the M2 line. A further candle opened below the M2 and closed above it, so things were looking better for an entry. A bearish candle held things up until we finally had what looked like an entry position (1st yellow arrow). Again, doubts crept in as I looked at the Guppy LT lines which were totally compacted. I then abandoned the idea, and if you look at the following two candles with their very bearish upper shadows, I was probably justified. A nice profit missed perhaps, but for me, the signals said "NO!" The second opportunity was more straightforward for me, as the Guppy by this time had developed nicely and there was a lot of room to move before hitting the Pivot Point i.e. a rather comforting R/R situation. Entry and exit points are clearly marked and the trade ends up with a 32 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Another nice opportunity after a period of sideways movement and a very compacted Guppy. At times like these, it's always useful to draw S/R lines (green dotted lines) and wait and see if they get breached. The DZ gave a very early warning of something happening (1st yellow vertical), and everything was set up nicely in the middle window, just waiting for the lsma3 to enter the orange/blue zone. That happened at the same time as the DZ green line crossed the red middle band (purple rectangle), so it was a case of waiting for the Resistance line to be crossed. It was crossed just as Guppy ST was starting to expand, and I eventually exited just as the lsma3 was leaving the orange/blue zone. I have to admit I was a bit concerned by the candle before my exit candle, as it formed a very bearish long shadow at the R1 line, but Guppy by that time looked very strong, which is why I decided to let the trade run for a little while. If it hadn't been for Guppy, I'd have been out pronto, which just goes to show yet again how Dollie and Guppy complement one another. If there's anybody else out there using this great Dollie method, then feel free to pop in anytime. I'll even put the kettle on. (For a cup of tea. It's an English thing!)

I've been watching it, it moves good if you try and focus on only the LSMA and nothing else until you get your signal.. I'll try post some charts when I see them.. Ive got it loaded on GBPUSD/GBPJPY/EURUSD/NZDUSD And save the cup of tea.. geordies don't drink with Mancs..

This one from the swissy this morning would have tested the patience of a Saint! Roughly three quarters of an hour from the initial signal until my entry point. I could have got in earlier, but I wanted to make sure everything was in my favour. My first priority was for the price to clear the M2 line along with the Guppy showing signs of coming out of its very congested state. My entry was at the point where I could finally see a separation of ST and LT lines, with price still in a good R/R position. My exit was obviously prompted by the proximity of the Pivot line, plus the forming of the gravestone doji. In the end, a handy 18 pip profit, but the trade was also a good lesson in patience, and taking into account pivots, candles and Guppy's signals, after Dollie played its own very important part.

Cable produced this opportunity this morning, but boy, one had to wait for the action for quite a while after the initial signal. From the 1st yellow vertical to the 2nd one, there was about an hour and 10 minutes to wait. I wasn't really concerned with the lsma3, because I was still waiting for the ASH to finally rise above the zero line, which, when it did, was the entry signal I was waiting for. I got in at 2.0470, just under the S1 line, and the entry was reinforced by the nice widening of the Guppy ST ma's, plus the way they were separating from the LT's. Exit was routine at the 3rd yellow vertical, with the price at 2.0425,just above the M0 line as the lsma3 was leaving the orange/blue zone. Well worth the wait!

I really wish I'd seen this one. Swissy shows just how good this method can be from time to time. It was Dollie who showed the way in with the green/blue cross in the DZ window. RSI2/CCI6 crossed the zero line VERY decisively, so Dollie is telling us something WAS going to happen. I've got very uncertain about the lsma3 for entries lately, as it tends to wander all over the place, especially when one is backtesting. With this in mind, I prefer to rely on the CCI6, as it stays in pretty close proximity to RSI2, so its entry into the orange/blue zone is more reliable as far as I'm concerned. So Dollie raised the target, and I would have pulled the trigger at the candle crossing the M2 line, leaving it room to breathe before the next line. However, as you can see, one could have left it to Guppy then, as it was opening up nicely with practically no pullbacks whatsoever. A couple of pauses brought us a few dojis signifying "taking a breather" rather than uncertainty. That's the way I interpret it, as there was no sign of Guppy weakening. Still, a good exit would have been possibly at M4, but definitely at R2, as lsma3 had bull-dozed its way into OB territory and was leaving the orange/blue zone. I'll leave you to work out the potential profits of what would have been a great trade!

Eyevoltage: I saw your post but was interested why you wouldn't trade the euro/dollar instead. At least here we get a better price and spread. but forget that, look at the pound last night. It can drive me to drink wanting to stay up all night trading the gbp/usd, eur/usd, gbp/jpy. That was 400+ pips in one night. Here is just the chart for the pound. I don't think I need to detail all the signs on why this trade looks good.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I sympathize, mate. In answer to your question re the eur/usd.......quite simply, this morning presented so many opportunities, I guess everybody over here would have been spoilt for choice! For me, I guess, I traded Cable because that's the main pair I watch, with the other major pairs on the sidelines which I check out from time to time. Your chart was pretty self-explanatory, mate, and I can understand your frustration. Attached is how I would have seen it, if I'd been checking out the 1H chart. I would have had a choice of two entries.....the aggressive one at 2.0492, or the break-out one at 2.0433, with the exit at or around the doji I've marked at 2.0274. Either one would have yielded a good profit, mate. I guess I'm going to have to check the 1H charts out more often! Get yourself over here, mate, and as we say over here, fill your boots!!! Cheers

Yet another Cable offering this morning. Yellow vertical indicates the first inkling of something coming up (Green/Blue cross in the DZ window). Everything was looking good in the middle window just after that point, so it was just a case of waiting for the price to get above that Pivot line and see if Guppy was going to sort itself out. After around half an hour, things started happening and the rest is history, as they say. A nice entry point (great R/R situation), and an excellent exit target achieved at just under the M3 line.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
This time it's the EUR/JPY that makes us wait for potential riches to unfold. The DZ window gives us a heads-up at a time when price is looking distinctly ropy, to put it mildly. One wonders what can possibly develop from this position. However, looking at Dollie in the middle window, it's pretty obvious that it looks as if it means business, but Guppy looks very compressed. So, it's back to the waiting game, and the eventual entry is where there is an obvious gap opening up between Guppy ST's and LT's. Seeing as the entry is above the half-way mark between pivot lines, a small SL is advisable (well, it always is, isn't it?) and is indicated by the green dotted line. Eventual exit is at 163.02, just over the M3 line, but the profit has been savaged a little by the spread on this pair, which, at this time, is standing at 8 pips.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I know that, since we live in different countries, the pip spreads and payouts are not the same, but mate you need to get another broker! 8 pips on eur/jpy is outrageous. My spread is 4 with a 80 cents (.8) to the dollar payout on all jpy pairs. We pay 9 pips on the gbp/jpy, which is too high but the way it moves it is worth it. You can even go 4 pips with small commission on the g/j. Since the UK is the capital of forex I would think there would be better competition and pricing. Look around as that is a great pair to trade.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I hear what you say, mate, and that broker is ditched. Thankfully, with this system I'm using, there's more winners than losers, so that spread didn't hurt as much as it could have done! The other spreads seemed ok. I don't know why, but I didn't check what the spreads were on ALL the pairs, just the ones I usually look at. Obviously, eur/jpy wasn't one of them, which will teach me a lesson for the future. From what I've seen on other brokers sites, gbp/jpy averages around 7 pips over here, but I could be wrong obviously as I haven't checked them all out. Thanks for your post, mate. Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Could you guys please tell me the rules you are using for this system. By looking at your posted screenshots it seems as if you have modified the system. thanks

--- 帖子 #478 ---
If you read this thread from the beginning, you will see that you're correct in your assumption that it has been modified. However, I still use the original Dollie system, to which I've added the Dynamic Zone indicator from the new Dollie system and also the Guppy MMA method. I stress that this is MY modified version of Dollie, which I've found to be very effective. If you look at the various screenshots and read the accompanying analysis, you won't have any difficulty interpreting the method. Cheers

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I switched to the 15m chart for this one. The 1st yellow vertical indicates the first signal from the DZ window. (I was actually still in bed at this time!) By the time I finally got up, and saw what was happening, price was ambling along the Pivot line, whilst Guppy was slowly waking up. Price opening above the Pivot line signalled my entry, and that's when Guppy took over. Initially though, if you look at the middle window at the time of the DZ indication, you'll see how the RSI2 has already crossed the zero line, with the CCI6 rapidly following. The ASH is already languishing just above the OS line, so everything at that point was signalling a potential trade. Other traders may have entered before me, but I prefer to wait until the Pivot line has been breached. I was tempted to exit as the M3 line was reached, but again, Guppy was indicating possible further action, so I waited, with the result you can see on the chart. Not a bad result seeing as how I was asleep when the move started!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
The rules are at the beginning of the thread. The latest motified version starts at post #296. Paper trade for a month or two. You will love it. Eyevoltage is the man as you can see by his trades.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
On average how many pips are you guys making from this system per month? Has it been consistent?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I think it was in Dollie's first post on this thread that she said something like: "I don't see how you could lose pips on this." That's how confident she was in her excellent system, and she's been proved right. The original method she came up with was brilliant, as far as I'm concerned. Then Pip-pirate and her got together and came up with a more sophisticated version, using more indicators, and by all accounts, it has been just as successful as the original. However, you'd have to ask pip-pirate about that, as he uses it exclusively on a longer TF. I prefer to stick with the original, which as I already told you, I've slightly modified for my own purposes. One thing I can tell you is that the method - original or modified - is very consistent. As far as average pips are concerned, it's something I've not bothered to work out. All I know is that it does the business, produces pips on a regular basis, with very few bad trades. In fact, the bad trades that I've had were almost all due to careless judgement on my part. As the pirate said, give it a go, paper trade or demo for a while, and as the pirate also said: "You will love it!" Cheers

--- 帖子 #483 ---
This is an example of what looks like a possible trade, but when examined closely, just isn't worth the effort because thing just don't look good. The initial signal in the DZ window is fair enough, but follow the 1st yellow vertical line up and what do you see? In the middle window, the RSI2 has crossed the zero line with the CCI6 in this case, lagging quite a bit. The lsma3 is entering the orange/blue zone, but in a very high position which doesn't give it much room to move before possibly crossing the OB line. In the chart window itself, the candle the vertical line corresponds with, is very near the R1 line. In cases like this, I would normally wait until the line has been breached, but in this particular case, I wouldn't have bothered with the trade at all. Look at the candle before the actual breach.......it's a spinning top. Not a very positive sign. Then, when the line is breached by the next candle, as I mentioned earlier, the lsma3 is heading out of the orange/blue zone, and into the OB zone. The whole thing would have been a high-risk trade, and not worth the effort when there's so many better opportunities around. Everyone would have their own reasons for not entering this trade, but for me, the whole thing centred around the R1 line, which is why I would never ever be without Pivot Points. They can indicate good entries, and on the other hand, bad ones like this one, and very rarely do they let you down. Quite simply, I love 'em!! EDIT: In case you're wondering why I didn't go for the nice opportunity just previous to the above..........I was still in bed! Entry for that one would have been just before my alarm went off!!

Squid this question comes up a lot and eyevolt has answered it well. So much depends on you. No need to answer back but consider: How long have you been trading? What times of the day do you trade? What type of trader are you? How is your thinking and how many books have you read on thinking? Can you take a loss? I have realized after 2 1/2 years that I need to change from being a scapler to a swing trader and it is a hard process to change. So my results will be posted soon as the results improve. Paper trade for months and then the pips will come. Welcome to this wonderful system and continue to write. Spend the weekend going through the thread.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi Been watching Dollie for a while now, first tried it in it’s original format and seemed to get some nice result’s. Due to inconveniences (work) it’s difficult for me to trade the smaller time frames. Have any of you guy’s traded the higher time frames 4H or higher ?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I haven't traded Dollie on anything higher than a 15m chart. From what I can see, Dollie would seem to be just as efficient on the higher ones, but the man who can tell you better than me is pip pirate2. He's presently working on his 4H strategy, and has been for a while, so he's the man to talk to for the latest developments up there. Cheers

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Two opportunities here, but I wasn't really happy with the first one. I shouldn't have bothered as the set-up wasn't as neat as I would have liked. After the 1st yellow vertical, the RSI2/CCI6 weren't in that nice neat "together" formation that I prefer as they cross the zero line. Plus, Guppy wasn't showing any sign of life, so it should have been dismissed. (Don't take any notice of the lsma3 in the middle window. At the time I entered (1st blue arrow) it was actually well up near the OB zone, but as the chart progresses, it does move around a lot, and I'm rapidly losing patience with it. I'm starting to rely a lot more on the CCI6 line, which seems to be a safer option when it's in the orange/blue zone.) Anyway, as far as this trade is concerned, I decided to exit at the 2nd blue arrow as the RSI2/CCI6 was dropping rapidly with the CCI6 now outside the zone. 9 pips profit, but a bit of a high-risk trade and not recommended, so hopefully, I'll learn from this. The second opportunity is something else entirely, and when you see a set-up like this, you wonder wtf you bother with examples like the previous one for!! If you follow the 2nd yellow vertical up, you'll see how the RSI2/CCI6 are both crossing the the zero line together, with the Guppy looking a lot healthier. Again, at this point, the lsma3 as actually way up near the OB zone again, and not where you see it on this chart. Entry at the 3rd blue arrow, with the M4 line the target, but looking at Guppy, I was almost certain that it would progress further than that, which it eventually did. Exit was just under the R2 line (4th blue arrow), as the lsma3 was leaving the zone. (The lsma3 DOES play its part, obviously, but make a habit of judging each case on its merits). Just look at Guppy at that point.......a lovely separation of MA's on the ST, with a widening gap between the ST and LT lines. Superb! Another great example of how Dollie and Guppy complement one another.

Swirly: Here are a few charts to show you what you can do. I simply found these two charts as examples as you can choose whatever pairs you want. The first chart uses the H4. As you know you might have to have a large S/L when you enter. I use Dollie's system part two (post #296). Look as all the indicators are important. Don't rely on just one. The arrows are the first at 10/22 at 0GMT, the second is at 10/24 at 0GMT, and the third is at 10/29 at 4GMT. The triple hull moves first to tell you something might be happening. Then the dynamic looks really good and I really like to have a flat macd. Know your candles too as you can see in the third example.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Here is an example with the daily chart, The first arrow is at 10/15 at 0GMT and the second at 10/25 at 0GMT. Notice the HMA color moving average has changed color. Big stop losses of course and then move to break even.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I'll have a look through your examples tonight when I'm home, there's a bit more to take in than when I originally looked at Dollie. I let you know how it goes. Are there any alerts that have been developed for Dollie that indicate when one of the conditions has been met to give you a heads up so that you can check the other indicators ?

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I was still working on stopping my eyes from closing this morning when this opportunity arose, but I was up earlier than usual anyway. I always have trouble getting accustomed to the clocks going back to herald the approach of winter. Anyway, everything was looking good at the yellow vertical, and I waited then to see if the price would breach the Pivot Point. It opened slightly above it eventually, about the same time as lsma3 was crossing the zero line, so that was my entry point. My initial target was the M3 line, which looked dodgy for a while (long upper shadows and dojis), but as the next candle breached the M3 line with very small upper and lower shadows, and the Guppy ST ma's were separating nicely, things looked pretty good. My exit point was just under the R1 line as lsma3 was about to leave the orange/blue zone and head into OB territory. It's always worth issuing a reminder about candle shadows. If you're going long, candles with long upper shadows could be bad news. If you're going short, the same goes for long lower shadows. Keep an eye out for them!

--- 帖子 #492 ---
There aren't any alerts that I am aware of as we speak. The problem is as I see it with Dollie and alerts is that you must look at two or more indicators to confirm the move. One indicator isn't enough. You will learn with paper trading that there is a "feel" to the trade and if it is going to go the way you want it with the indicators. Now on the positive side: With a H4 or above outlook, you will see that there are the better times to take a trade, say in the london session as I see by your log in times you seem to be trading during that session. If you trade the london session you have to get rich eventually in my opinion. Paper trade for months, because you will be making fewer trades a month than most people. Look forward to your progress. Read any successful person’s biography and it goes like this: struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, struggle, struggle, small success; struggle, big struggle, struggle, BIG SUCCESS . See setbacks as proof of your future success. What makes anyone think that trading is any different?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
thanks pip pirate I'll let you know how things progress

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I deliberately got up earlier this morning, seeing as things seem to start happening whilst I'm still in the Land of Nod! I wasn't disappointed as you can see from this USD/JPY chart. 1st yellow vertical = DZ heads-up (green crosses blue), which had already happened whilst I was in bed! 2nd yellow vertical = My entry point. Guppy was showing signs of waking up, plus, everything in the middle window was looking good. Again, like yesterday, ignore where the lsma3 is on the chart. It wasn't in that position at the time of the entry, but it just seems to hop around as the mood takes it. As I've mentioned before, I tend to take more notice of the CCI6 now, and if that's well-established in the orange/blue zone, as it was here, then I'm happy. Anyway, roughly an hour and three-quarters later, I exited the trade just under the M4 line, as lsma3 was leaving the zone into OB territory. However, if you look just under there, if I'd concentrated on the CCI6 instead, then I could have squeezed maybe another 5 or 6 pips out of it, but I prefer to err on the side of caution. Like yesterday, let me mention the candles again. Three of the candles during the trade are showing quite long upper shadows, so I kept a very close eye on them. You can't be too careful, even when everything's falling into place nicely and it looks like a brilliant trade. It's about then that complacency sets in, and sooner or later bites you in the ass!!

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Swirly here is a big time trade that of course I didn't take as I was still studying also. This one takes some guts and patience. I smile when people don't want to trade the gbp/jpy because of the spread. Well it only moved over 550 pips that's all. Who cares about the spread? Now let me show you what I am trying to get better at and how the ideal way to make this trade in my opinion. First the daily chart. As you can see the pair made a strong short and then flatten out. It looks like it wants to go long. I love waiting for a flat macd on the zeromacd. The first arrow is at 10/25 and the second is at 10/28. You would have to have a big s/l to make it on the 25th but if you waited until the 28th it just went long. Green line on dynamic wasn't that great until the 28th and triple hull wasnt' great also. but follow what you could have done combining this with the H4

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Now let's use the H4 to build up some pips to make the big trade. As you can see, once you knew that the pair had made its short move down and was consolidating, you could move to the H4 to make some pips. The first arrow was at 10/22. That move was 200+ pips. Great green line on the dynamic and the triple hull let us know the move could be coming. Then you wait. the second arrow is on 10/25. Now if you did enter here you can see it was a rough ride for a few days. But since you are up a lot of pips, you could set a big S/L and ride it out. If you waited until the 10/28, set your self for break even and let it ride for 400 more. Just some ideas.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
You wait for ages, then two come along at once......well, relatively speaking, seeing as we're talking about Forex! The first one took nearly an hour and three-quarters (after the initial DZ warning) until the entry point appeared, and quite a lot of THAT candle had already appeared before Guppy starting convincing me that it was worth a punt. The next candle produced one of those dreaded "long upper shadows", but the following candle was very strong with only a token resistance from the Bears (very short upper shadow and a shaven bottom, if you'll pardon the expression!). My exit was prompted by the simultaneous exits of CCI6 and lsma3 from the orange/blue zone which was just as well when you look at the candle following my exit! After that one, I wasn't really bothered, to be honest, but I left the monitor on whilst I was occupied by other things. I didn't really expect another signal of any note, but you can be sure that the rising candle after the DZ signal had my UNDIVIDED attention! I jumped right in after the candle opened above the M3 line and Guppy was showing a healthy widening of the ST ma's, plus a good separation from the LT's. I was a bit premature in my eventual exit, as both the CCI6 and the lsma3 had some potential left in the orange/blue zone. However, it was that pesky upper shadow, plus being right underneath the R1 line that finally had me leaving pips on the table. Just as a footnote, these two trades were the only ones up to now that had been signalled by the DZ. The only other one was around 5.00am. No prizes for guessing what I was doing at that time!! ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz!!!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Great trades and you are the man when it comes to the gbp. Just an observation and I don't know if it is true. Do you trade shorting the pair? (This is not a criticism by any means). I don't remember too many trades by you shorting. The movement can move faster on the shorts. the short right after your first trade had a great look on the green line on the dynamic zone. I woke up looking at all the money made during the london session. During that short move on the pound, the gbp/jpy moved over 300 pips short. I'm still working on trading the bigger charts. Love to see you results.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Pirate, this system makes it so easy to spot what's coming. That DZ window gives such obvious signals, and all it takes is for the middle window to line everything up and it's literally all systems go. Well spotted re the lack of short trades. The reason is that, all in all, I'm not happy with the lsma3, which is supposed to be, to all intents and purposes, the trigger-puller. Maybe it's just me, but it always seems to give later signals for shorts than it does for longs, and consequently loses pips. The reason I didn't take that short on the chart above was that I'm not keen on trading against a trend, and the Guppy was showing definite signs of a upward trend. I know that on the smaller TF's perhaps it's not THAT important, but whatever the TF, I'd rather stick with the trend, even if it IS a mini-trend! Does that make sense? By the way, as far as posting charts is concerned....I will if you will!! I give the picture of what's happening down my end of the spectrum, but I'd like to see more charts of yours, Pirate, so I can try and get my head around that system. Especially that Triple Hull. I'll crack it one day!! Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Eyevoltage you are so right in many ways. The DZ green line is one of the best indicators out there. I just use it long and short. As long as it has some distance between the green line and the blue line it is safe as you know. You are correct that it is good not to go against the trend, but when I get good signals from all the indicators I have to go. Now for your answer to the triple hull. I love it as it can be an alert to an up and coming move. Look at the chart a few post back that I posted and you will see a perfect triple on the left. In this example long, 1. The blue line (RSI)must be heading up at 2 o'clock or steeper. 2. The dotted lines of triple hull and CCI must be following it closely and with a similar angle. CCI will usually hug the blue RSI. 3. Most important is how the LSMA reacts to all of this. In this example, it is at the bottom and then must start to go long. The LSMA moves more like a moving average and follows the candle moves. So if the LSMA is not moving long, then there is no trade as the blue lines will go up and down a lot with false moves. So if all the indicators here are moving together there is a good chance of a move. Usually this combo will give you a clue, especially on the bigger charts, that a move is coming soon. Then you use the other indicators to confirm and make the trade. So maybe just look at the triple hull on the H1 and M30 charts just to see if a move is coming, not to trade off of as you use the M15 charts the most. It gives me confidence that when I see a move starting, that I know it will give some pips. Try it out.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Thanks for all the info, pirate. I have a few templates for this method, but none of them seem to fit the bill somehow. The Triple Hull comes up with just RSI2, CCI6 and lsma3, so I'm missing the actual TH Levels 1 and 2 would you believe? I'll have a quick look through the attachments, and see if there's anything there, when I've finished this. I'll really have to go back in this thread to where this new method started, and read it again, because I've only a vague idea of how the TH operates. If and when I finally crack it, I probably won't go up to 4H, mate, but possibly 1H at the very most! Just going off topic, mate.....watched a triple header here last evening. First off was the Chargers at the Vikings, which turned out to be a stuffing for the Chargers! The Vikes defence was awesome, as was the rookie running-back, Peterson. Next was the Patriots at the Colts, and that was pretty good, with the Patriots getting a win in overtime. I only got half-way through the last game, which was the Cowboys at the Eagles. When we reached half time, it was around 2.30am here, and I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer!! I know Dallas were winning, but I still don't know the final result. Keep smiling, mate. Cheers Edit: Just found out the Cowboys beat the Eagles, mate. They're having a good season!

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Now last night, for me, the trend on the pound is long so I was not confident in taking this trade. But what we learn is the market is going to do what it wants. The arrow is at 7GMT. Beautiful green line on the dynamic and the RSI part of the triple hull was straight down. Had to get in right when London opened. You can see by the next candle with the wicks that it was moving around. Good 50 pips in the first hour.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hey pirate. Great chart, mate. 07.00 here would have been around 23.00 in your neck of the woods, am I right? Pirate, would you do me a favour and take me through the chart from the first signal you spotted. Was it the green/blue cross in the DZ, or was it something else? Plus, I noticed that the MACD had been in negative territory from some while before the trade. Mainly, I get a bit confused by the Triple Hull window, so maybe you can enlighten me a little? Thanks in advance, mate. Cheers

--- 帖子 #504 ---
This wasn't the best chart by far. You can see from other charts better examples. Yes it is 11pm my time. If you look at a H4 chart, you can see on the zeromacd's that there was two flat macd's at the start and during the asian session. So there is the first clue. I watched the asian session and you could tell that there wasn't a lot going on or reasons to move any pairs. So I waited for later in the asian to see if there will be a move. Since it is Sunday/Monday I like to believe that there will be action sometime. Now the triple hull wasn't very good during the session until the time where I put the arrow. It goes straight down, which is a clue. The green line in the dynamic is below the blue line for hours so that was another clue. Then the green line took a dive also which made me more confident. The macd's were not very clear. This is why I don't post all the time as I like to show the best chart examples. but here it worked. Also a good point: All the gbp pairs were going short at the same time so that was another clue. So eyevoltage, look back on this forum and you can find better examples of the triple hull.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Here is another example. I know that there are many who don't trade this pair but it is a good example today. You will see 3 big moves. The long move in the middle was at the end of the US session and through the asian session. You can see that it moves a lot long and short so it can be a real ride. If you have the patience it became a great move. but another move was at the open of the US session. The first arrow on the triple hull was at 8GMT. You can see that the blue line on triple is going short. You could have gotten in the trade and made a few pips but as you can see the london session bounced around. So take the pips and get out. Then you see the second arrow at 11GMT. Now notice that the height of the second blue line is lower than the first arrow. This can be important as it can signal a short move coming. At the zeromacd there have been 4 relatively flat macds during the london session, also signaling a possible move coming. At the arrow at the macd, at 13 GMT, here comes the short move. The HMA color moving average changes color and the green line in DZ also was going short. The shape of the triple hull et all is looking good also. And don't forget the candles. So you need multiple indicators to add in your decision.

Many thanks indeed, Pirate, for those two charts and your analysis. There is still a lot to take in and a lot to look at, but I think it's all starting to come together now, and make more sense to me. As I said before, I don't think I'll ever trade higher than 1H purely and simply because "position" trading just doesn't appeal to me. So the 1H will suit me fine. I haven't done anything this last couple of days, except read the threads in FF, trying to digest not only this method, but boxingislife's thread on "sexy stochastics", which I've found to be VERY informative, as I've never really understood stochs before. However, I won't desert Dollie/Guppy. See next post for the reasons why! Thanks again, me old mate. Cheers

Cable offered this opportunity just before 9.00am GMT. Guppy was well separated for ages before the trade, but as you can see, price was just ambling along the M4 line with the Guppy ST's congesting all the time, even though the LT's were looking very strong. The DZ showed the green RSI line headed south and nothing seemed on at all. However it all changed rather suddenly, with the green RSI line crossing the blue MA and the orange lower band at the same time. Simultaneously, there was a rapid widening of the orange/blue zone in the middle window, with the RSI2/CCI6 looking as it wanted to make up for lost time! My entry was a little after the M4 line. I normally like to wait for a candle opening ABOVE the line, but in this case, everything just seemed to be so damned PERFECT, so I jumped in. The DZ green and blue lines were separating well, so I sat back to enjoy the ride. (No, I didn't! ). There wasn't much bear activity until the third candle, when price tested the R3 line and fell back a bit. I could have got out then, but honestly, with Guppy looking the business, I thought I'd chance it, and I'm glad I did. A doji re-tested the resistance, before another positive candle punched straight through it! I got myself in a bit of a "tizz" trying to exit just then, which explains why I exited when I did, although the lsma3 had just left the zone, and the CCI6 was in the process of doing so as well. As I type this, R3 has been tested again three or four times, and it looks as if price has given up and is starting to go short in a sulk!

Very good trade. You can see the candle before the move compressed like a spring ready to go. I'm amazed that they just blew through the 1000 mark like it wasn't there. Look at the flat macd's on M30 before the move and how all the candles were just waiting for something.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Pirate, I'm still a bit in the dark re parts of the new method. I've attached a 30m chart with my entry from the 15m marked with the yellow vertical. (I've closed the ADX window to aid clarity, as my screen ain't that big!) From the bottom, I can see the green crossing the blue. In the middle, I can see the flat macd's you mentioned, plus the blue RSI2 crossing the zero line, closely followed by the red ZeroLag MACD. In between them crossing the line, there's a lone solitary positive MACD starting to poke up. So I take it that everything I've mentioned that's happening in the MACD window is relevant? In the chart window, of course, things are pretty clear. The only thing that's different from my chart is the entry point. On this 30m chart, I wouldn't have entered the trade until price had cleared the HMA hurdle, whereas on the 15m chart, I didn't have that problem. Now then. I'm sorry, mate, but the Triple Hull still continues to elude me. For the life of me, I still can't see what it's trying to say. The lsma3 has crossed the zero line roughly at the same time as the MACD signal and the DZ signal, and for a short time, ALL indicators in the Triple Hull are above zero. Is this significant? Plus, where's the exit point supposed to be? In the method I use, exit is somewhere around where lsma3 is leaving the orange/blue zone, but I can't see a clear exit point on this method. I hate to try your patience, mate, but a little more help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers

Eyevoltage: To no fault of your own, this is a bad example of the triple hull et all to use as an indicator. You are correct when it doesn't give a great signal. I will answer your questions first. 1. Indicators above zero is a positive sign. 2. The exit signal. Here is where the RSI2 on the triple hull is good. If the blue line, RSI2, starts reversing direction straight up or down, it is time to think about an exit. Look at the candles to help confirm.The RSI is a early signal indicator that says: "Hey mate, something is going to happen". The bad news is that it give false signals all day long. That is why you have to use it with all the other indicators together. 3. LSMA and exits. On a good move, I also look to exit when the blue RSI and LSMA touch at the top or bottom of the indicator. Then I get nervous and look for a possible exit. Not necessarily get out but start to watch it. I like the triple hull when an important time of the day is coming up. We all know that there are certain times of the day when there is a possible move coming, like opening of the 3 sessions. The triple hull will let me know, usually one candle ahead or more, that there is a possible move coming on this pair. Then I look at the macd's for a flat candle. Then I look for the green on DZ and if it says go, then go. When the triple hull looks the best, it screams Here comes a move! but it doesn't look the best most of the time. What interests me about your chart is the look of the lsma. As you can see with my chart, taken at the same time, is that my lsma is different than yours. My pink lsma is going along the bottom and then makes the move up. This is important to the system. The lsma should lag behind the blue line in timing but it should go in the same direction, at roughly the same angle, and best if it starts at the top or bottom, not in the middle. I don't know why our two lsma's are different. You are right that the M15 chart looks better. This can be true with the triple hull that you need to look at many charts to see if it looks good. Look at the following posts: #496 on the left side is great. #471 on the right side. #457 there is two great triples. These examples are the best looking triples. Many times it doesn't look that great so don't use it. That is why we need several indicators to tell us to take the trade. but when it looks great, there can be a very good trade and then the exit. Never a problem to help the team. I need to give more.

Here's a better example of Dollie today. The first arrow above the Blue line on the RSI is at one height. The second arrow has made a lower height. So we have lower highs. Notice that the candles above are not really showing a short move yet. Then you see that the RSI et al are moving short, and the arrow above the candle has the move really starting. The move was at 18GMT. No flat macd's but there are going short. the green on the DZ is great as always.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I truly appreciate the time and effort you've put in trying to hammer "the knowledge" home into this dunce's head, mate!! I studied your charts closely and took note of all your comments regarding the different indicators. I see now why you need so many. If one doesn't look right, then don't use it, as long as the others are ok.......am I right? Makes life a lot easier, pirate, I don't mind telling you! I guess I'll still struggle with the Triple Hull, but at least there is now a glimmer of light on the horizon. I'm as puzzled as you are re the lsma3, mate. It seems to have a life of its own as the chart moves along. Having said that, I've attached my version of the GBP/JPY chart you posted. You can see the obvious difference, can't you? Where you have two lovely lower highs, I simple have a straight top! Explain that, if you can, 'cos I can't! The only reason I can think of is that my computer is a bit of a dinosaur with quite a small screen compared with the latest machines, so my screen shots are, shall we say, somewhat "compacted"!! I haven't looked at those other charts you suggested just yet, but I will get around to it. I've been a bit busy today, for reasons I won't go into here, so very little time to "chart gaze"! By the way, the Dynamic Zone RSI works very well with other methods, mate. I've been looking at other systems and methods, just out of curiosity, and it's amazing how the DZ, when applied, improves the method no end! It's a killer.............did Dollie invent it or did it just appear one day in a flash of light as a message of hope for mankind? Either way, it's the dog's bollocks! Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Eye: I have no idea why our screens are different. I do have a new 22" screen that a friend bought for me out of the blue. He has his doubts still about me trading for a living but does support me. Don't worry so much about the triple, as it is one of many indicators. Where Dollie gets these indicators is a mystery to me. I think she gets them from others and then plays with it. I know she is always working on them to make them better. I told her these were fine, it is me that has to use them properly. Lately I realize I have been struggling with reading candles correctly. Remember I used a totally different system and am less than a year old learning how to use normal charts and indicators. The goal is the same: Gather pips regularly and who cares what system works for you. I love this one and will continue to use it.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Wow! A 22" screen? I have to admit that recent developments have passed me by computer-wise, mate, and I'm still using what would be considered a museum-piece now, I guess. However, that will hopefully change in the very near future, as I fully intend getting up to date, so to speak! And about time too. I'm wondering what you meant by "realizing that you're struggling with reading candles lately". When I started looking into this game, candlesticks were one of the first things I studied, so that I had at least a rudimentary knowledge of them. Once you've got that, you then continue to learn as you go along, which is the beauty of the candlestick theory. I find that I'm not comfortable with line or bar charts, as you can't instantly weigh up situations with them like you can with candlesticks. Anyway, as you know, they've been around for centuries, so that's more than good enough for me. And I couldn't agree more with your statement: "Who cares what system works for you"............as long as the pips keep coming in, that's all that matters. Also, thanks for your kind comments in your PM. One just has to get on with it. No choice in the matter, my friend. Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Eyevoltage, what I meant by struggling with candles is that I bought a trading software program that only had what looks like two moving averages, although it is more complicated than that, for a lot of money. So for 2 years I only use that and never saw a regular chart with candles and indicators. My challenge has been to see what it really happening in the moment and then placing the trade with confidence. I have to study for weeks and see it over and over again to "make sure" that what I see is correct most of the time. Everytime I have changed a time frame or indicators the process starts over again. It's getting better every minute and every day as I build the confidence.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
A little while ago, pip pirate2 asked me why I always seemed biased towards long trades as opposed to short trades. I think that this chart answers his question to a certain extent. The yellow arrow indicates that the DZ is telling us something's going to happen. The green arrow in the chart window indicates the entry point, because it's right under the S1 line. Now strictly speaking, the entry point should be where the lsma3 enters the orange/blue zone (indicated by the red arrow), but as I've said before, it always seems to me to indicate a short entry a lot later than it would a long one. Plus, if you look at where price is, precisely above the red arrow, you can see how many pips you'd have had to miss before you finally got in. Which is why, on trades like this one, I always give priority to the CCI6 and the point at which it enters the orange/blue zone (indicated by the green tick). Then, it's just a case of waiting for price to breach the S1 line, and if you also notice what Guppy's telling you by the separation of its ma's, then you can enter with confidence. The blue arrow indicates where the exit point would have been (just as it reached S2), and I estimate a potential profit of 238 pips (less spread)! However, if you'd have waited for the lsma3 to do its stuff, then entry would have been at the opening of the candle just under M1. The same candle, in fact, that I've just nominated to be the potential exit point at its close. In this case, profit would have been limited to a mere (!) 61 points (less spread). To be honest, I didn't take this trade as I was otherwise engaged, only spotting it as it was coming to an end (drat!). So, the message is, be flexible. Don't just rely on the lsma3 for your entry point. There are other, more reliable, signals sometimes, and it pays to have a bit of patience and LOOK for them!

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Thank you for answering my question, mate. I can appreciate how difficult it is for you to get so used to one platform, and then have to do it all again, so to speak. No wonder you were having problems, and it's a credit to your sheer tenacity that you seem to be succeeding in your efforts. Keep at it, mate! Cheers

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Eye and Pip (sounds like a double act)!! Well I guess you are really as between the two of you you have kept this thread going for which I thank you. I came across this a couple of days ago, and would have posted earlier but have spent an age reading all posts and studying the charts with the excellent analysis. I mainly trade off the lower TF. I must say I was very pleased when I came across Eyevoltages' posts to say that you were trading the 5m. Having said that I have long been thinking off setting up a new account to trade the longer TF (on micro lots to start), so I have also learnt much from Pip as well. I must admit I can't believe that this thread is so quiet with the excellent results most who have visited here have obtained. Once I get my templates sorted I plan to join you guys in posting charts and hopefully join in the discussions. Excellent thread. Derm

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hello Derm and welcome to the thread. I don't post that much anymore (I did a few pages ago) but check the thread everyday to see if there are any good updates. I also scalp and recently began working off the 1min charts. I don't recommend this for a beginner. You have to be quick and have a strong stomach but I find it exciting. Anyway, I still use Dollies original setup with the LSMA as well as a GMMA Slow Indicator (guppy) as well as 4 EMAs (8 10 12 16). I also use the Dynamic Zone RSI and the Average Directional Movement (ADX) set to 7 and wait for the 45 line to be breached. I strongly recommend you use this if you are going to scalp. According to Investopedia: "The ADX is measured on a scale between zero and 100. Readings below 20 are used to indicate a weak trend, while readings over 40 indicate a strong trend. ADX is not used to determine the direction of a particular trend, but only to gauge its strength." I don't ever go against the GMMA and I make sure the EMAs are starting to separate. (I got this from Eyevoltage). One I see that the GMMA and EMAs are working together I check my other indicators and then make a move. I've attached three charts from this morning where I netted over $800 bucks. Let me know if you need any of the indicators. Jake

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hi Jake Many thanks for the welcome. Also many thanks for sharing your scalping strategy and for posting charts. Very impressed with your results earlier today. I am going to be a busy boy looking at these new setups!! Thanks Again Derm

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hi Jake I think I got it. I'm looking forward to trying this out. Thanks again Derm

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi Jake Here's an indicator you may be interested in as extra (if needed) confirmation that the price is going upwaard. It's Laquerre, I have set the gamma to 0.55. It can be used stand alone to buy at .15 going up and exiting at .85 on way down after peak or sell at .85 coming down and buy at .15 when it goes back from base. It can sometimes keep you in the trade longer as when price is continuing upwards it will stay at or near 100, and likewise at or near 0 when price is heading downwards. Can be a very powerful with the trend, but take extra care when going against the trend. Derm

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Someone nicked my chart!!!! Ah there it is The gamma setting on the Laguerre can be changed for signals on different timeframes. I have been playing with for a few weeks now but still not sure of the best settings!! I will keep testing. Hope this is of use Derm

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Derm, attached is a quick trade for 5 pips. Since you are new to this I don't recommend you start with the 1min charts. Start with the 5min charts while you papertrade a little so you can see the indicators live. The LSMA indicator window is tricky and adjusts in realtime and this can be misleading when you back test this method. The attached trade is more on line of what I get throughout the day. I use MB Trading as my platform. They give very small spreads (1 &amp; 2 on everything I trade) except the GBP/JPY (usually 4-5 spread). They do charge a comission that roughly equals 1 pip. I have built up enough money that allows me to trade 100,000 lots now so these little moves add up to a few hundred bucks a day and on days like this week when the Yen is going crazy $1,000+. I started only trading 20,000 lots per trade and did that for 3 months. As I got more comfortable with this system and confident with the real time results I started to increase my lot size gradually. I honestly can say that when I see a trigger I go for it. I always get out of a trade once I am down 10 pips... ALWAYS!!! Does the market sometimes turn around? Of course it does but sometimes it doesn't and then next thing you know your down 30 pips and when you are scalping that sucks. Good Luck and I hope this is all helpful. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Derm: Welcome to the posts. Yes it has been lonely with just eyevoltage and me just posting. Paper trade for months first so that you can figure out what works for you. Look forward to more messages.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi Jake Here's one using the lag. The Dollies indicated that there could have been a move coming with the blue crossing up over the pink and the lsma coming up into the 'zone' and changing colour. Also the lag had indicated that there was movement upwards. On this occassion the ADX was hardly above the 45 line. I often Buy the lag at .15 up and sell at .85 down in an uptrend and sell .85 down and buy .15 up in a downtrend. This indicator has worked very well for me especially on the Yen crosses, which I assume you like to trade as per your charts. I prefer to scalp. Although I am fairly new to this, I do this full time and have had enough of spending hours and hours on a daily basis glued to the screens. In, out take the money!! I work on a max 15 pips sl with the lag, there are losing trades but not many. having said that, sometimes (espeially if its a trading day) the lag will stay glued to the top or bottom for many bars, when this happens it can be possible to lock in profit and then go to a higher tf and get the bigger moves from a trade that started as a scalp. Happy pipping mate Derm

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I love this thread. Dollies system saved my account and that is the truth. I should post more often but I get too caught up in trading and making money!!!

Hi Pip Thanks for the welcome, and thank you once again for your efforts in keeping this thread alive. Thank you for your advice, and I know that everyone preaches paper trading and demo trading but I am off the ilk 'no pain no gain'. Now I am not saying that one should blow a fortune on learning, but I soon realised that demo trading did not give the 'emotion' that I needed. I am also not saying that I am an emotional trader, far from it. But I found trading live from almost day one was a huge benefit to me. Starting small (and I mean small) I found that when I did loose (very often at the start) personally gave me a greater determination to analsye my mistakes than trading on a demo account would ever have done. I found a broker that let me start at £0.10 a pip, yes I lost £300 fairly quickly, but I consider that a small amount to get me up and running and probably learnt much more by methodically going over all my trades (good &amp; bad) than most would have in buying a $2000 'guaranteed make your fortune in 5 minutes a day' forex course. Not for a second saying I am there yet, I know I never will be, but I am hungry and confident. Horses for courses but I have always thrown myself in the deep end. I believe it's the only way. And now this new set up. I have spent many an hour over the last few days looking, reading and learning, is it better than my current setup? Can it compliment my setup? And again I will go back to 10p trading to test - I don't just jump in with these 10p's, there are dozens of systems that I have looked at on various forums and gone no further. But I like this one and can see great potential so here goes!! It's a shame that Dollie and Blanca are no longer here, I would love to thank them for their input in earlier stages of the thread. Without their initiial input I would not be writing this. Regards Derm

Hey, pirate! Gettin' a bit crowded in here!! Seriously, it's great to see some posts and charts from other traders using this fantastic method! Derm and jcblcs79, welcome and nice to see you. Great charts as well, and it's good to know that there's money being earned out there. I never thought of using the ADX on my charts, even though it's been one of my favourites in the past. I know pip pirate uses it on his 4hr charts, but my old computer and its titchy screen just couldn't handle all those indicator windows, so something had to go, and I'm afraid it was the ADX. So it's nice to add it on to my 15m chart instead, and it's quite effective as well, in that it adds another useful signal. I still like to add the plus and minus DI's though.......doesn't look quite right without them, but hey, we all have our funny little ways, don't we? Been a lovely trade on EUR/JPY tonight. Heads up was around 18:00 GMT, with the actual entry around 19:15 GMT. Have a look...see what you think. 1st yellow line.....Heads up. 2nd yellow line......Entry. 3rd yellow line.....Exit. I loved how the ADX crossed the 45 line at about the same time as the DZ green line was crossing the upper band. Sometimes, I think it must be voodoo or something! Let's see more charts, guys. I love 'em and so does the pirate!! Cheers

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Sorry about that.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hey, Pirate!! It's gettin' CROWDED in here!!! Derm and jcblcs79, nice to see you and thanks for your great charts. It's great to see how you've both adjusted them to your own specs. That's evolution for you, man!! It's interesting how you've adjusted the Guppy. My own spec came from lever70 on the Cornflower thread. She used it on M1 charts for scalping, so you're both in good company. Best of luck, lads, and keep them pips rollin' in! Cheers

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Eye Thanks for the welcolm. I hope not to crowded!! Talking about crowds where is Dollie and Blanca? It would be great if they were here, nothing personal you and Pip have done a great job, but, hey, women are great at multitasking - Apparently!! Hope to have some great charts to post tommorow. May the pips be with us

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Shout out to all. It is great to see the site get all the posts. To answer the questions about Dollie and Blanca, here goes: I haven't talked to Dollie in a few months. We talked when she started this that she wouldn't have that much time to post. Unfortuately what happens with these web sites is that the founder gets slammed with PM' s and they have no time to trade. Dollie I believe is helping others with their trading and continuing to develop more indicators. I don't know if we will hear from her again. Blanca and I talk more often, but she too is very busy. If you haven't noticed, once you get this down and start really making pips and money, you don't have a lot of time to post. So you can tell I'm not there yet! lol. Whatever indicators work and how you mix and match is fine, but I would like to stick with most of the original mix here or else we can start another post. The greatest gift for both women would be to have many people succeed trading so let's go for that and help many others get there too.

Whilst I was still in the Land of Nod this morning, this opportunity arose in EUR/JPY. I installed the ADX last night after reading Derm's and jcblcs79's posts, although I prefer to use 20 and 40 and bring the plus and minus DI's in as well. I couldn't use the ADX before on Dollie's new method that Pirate uses, purely and simply because of my old computer's titchy screen. Not enough room, man! However, it fits in nicely on the method I use now. As you can see by the yellow vertical, the DZ green/blue cross occured slightly before the ADX and the +DI crossed into the 20/40 zone. Not long to wait for an entry, as you can see by the yellow arrows which indicated the DZ green line crossing the upper orange band, at the same time as the strong positive move from the ADX/+DI combination. Guppy then starts making its move to add further confirmation and exit would have been anywhere in the blue box, according to your own opinion as to how far it would travel. My target is usually the next pivot line, but obviously one has to be flexible! If Guppy weren't there, then I probably would have jumped ship at the first doji, but trusting Guppy has become a bit of a habit, and for my money, it was definitely saying "stay in", so I would have stayed until price reached the R1 line. By then, the lsma3 was headed into OB territory, so it would have been the sensible course of action.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
You should get the whole thing, mate.....14,20,5.........I can't understand why you haven't got it. Try installing this one that I use, to see if it makes any difference. Cheers

DZ indicator I have the following; extern int RSIPeriod = 14; extern int BandPeriod = 20; theres no 5 thanks

--- 帖子 #542 ---
It's still a mystery to me, mate, but you can try this if you want. The 5 you're missing is a 5sma (the blue line). Bring up the DZ that you have, and then drag an MA from the Navigator into the DZ window. Set it for 5, colour it Aqua, and where it says "apply to", set it for "previous indicator data". Now I've tried doing this and it works ok, so have a go and let me know how you go on. Cheers

Here is a trade I just got out of for 77 pips. I started on the 1min chart but then switched to the 5min chart after 15 min. This has been a great week to trade to say the least. I wish every week was like this. I would be retired and owning an island in 5 years!!!!

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I am very unconventional when I trade as I hardly set a profit target nor do I follow daily supports or resistance. I let the actual price movement tell me when I should get out of a trade. I generally use the EMAs, guppy &amp; Dollies indicator window as my exit tools. Please see the attached chart of a trade I just got out of to see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I want to show everyone how I evaluate a new trend and my process for taking a trade or not if the price moves through the GMMA. To me, the toughest call I have is when the price, EMAs and GMMA are all lumped together and then a breakout occurs especially if the price has now shifted through the GMMA. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
The DZ heads-up for this one was over an hour ago, as the green line crossed the blue one. The RSI2/CCI6 was heading down nicely, but the ASH was very sluggish as was the ADX, so it was another waiting game. Entry at the 2nd yellow vertical, as the ASH finally crossed the zero line, roughly at the same time as the lsma3 entered the orange/blue zone. In addition, the ADX and the -DI had already crossed the 40 line and Guppy was starting to show a healthy spread of ST ma's. Principal target was the M2 line, and by the time price had reached that area, Guppy ST's and LT's were nicely separated. However, with lsma3 rapidly approaching the OS zone and an exit from the orange/blue zone, one doesn't want to push one's luck, so it was "get the hell outta Dodge" time!

morning eye nice trade, I`ve got up my 5min cable chart but your trade times dont marry up with mine are you trading outside the UK? cheers

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hey jcblcs79. Great charts, mate, and I thoroughly approve of your style. You've taken this method and moulded it around your own requirements, with some success, and that's how it should be. Just wanted to ask you how you put those white information boxes on the chart window? It makes it a lot easier to see what's going on when the info is right there next to the action, so to speak. So I'd be grateful for that, mate, if you don't mind. Look forward to seeing more of your trades (and Derm's, by the way, if he's still around). Cheers

Hi Eyevoltage and all, You may remember I have been an observer of this thread since its inception and have been very impressed with the results. Having studied all of your wonderful charts I have decided that I will make this my main short term trading system however I have been having some problems while backtesting. I know some of the indicators move around a bit, but I would like to ask you how you avoid the false signals so well, going strictly by the rules I see all of the trades that you take but I also get caught with a fair few entries that don't go anywhere even when the guppies are looking good, I also get caught sometimes by closing a trade when the CCI leaves the zone, but then looking at your chart of the same trade you don't always get out when it first leaves the zone, sometimes its the 2nd or 3rd time. Sometimes on your charts you have your first yellow line on the latest DZ cross heads up but there are other DZ crosses beforehand, how do you avoid these. Would you be able to post maybe one or two charts of trades you have taken that haven't worked and have resulted in a loss, or are the charts you post all of the trades you have taken. This is in no way any criticism of your charts or the system, or your way of trading the system, I just want to get the full picture and am eager to learn more. I know backtesting isn't accurate but having spent a couple of weeks with it testing candle by candle my results are about 60% profitable, 20% that just don't go anywhere and probably come out even, and 20% that result in a loss, would you say from your experience that is about right, or is your overall success rate closer to your printed charts. Thanks for your help and keeping the thread going almost single handed until now with the help of the pirate.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi again, last chart has a good example, DZ cross heads up with the advantage of green DZ going through bollinger, CCI in zone, ADX showing strength, so we wait for the ST guppies to widen and the AS to cross the zeroline, AS just about to cross the centreline with lsma just about to go into zone where I have placed the green line for entry. To me it looks identical to your entry point on the next move, how did you avoid the trap of the first one and just take the 2nd one. I know the AS hasn't crossed the centreline and the lsma hasn't gone into the zone, but they are just about to and are in the same position as your entry in the next move, its only after the next candle they go through or not, but we don't know that in advance. I must state again, no criticism of anything you do or post I just want to learn the subtle signals you may see that keep you out of the first and get you in the second.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Three in a row,, I eyevoltage, answering for jc, the text is done within MT, just click on the "A" button on the toolbar, go to the 2nd line and type in the text you want, set the font size and colour and your done, when on the chart you can double click it like any line and move it around until its where you want it. To delete it, either double click and delete, or go into objects and do it from there.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Thanks for that, mate. I was aware of the "A" button but wasn't aware of how to move it around the screen. You learn summat every day! As regards your questions about the examples I've posted. Where do I start? Well, firstly, regarding my chart this morning.......there's two reasons I didn't take the first trade that you pin-pointed, mate. I know the first reason sounds pretty weak, but I simply hadn't managed to crawl out of bed just then! I spotted the second one just after switching the computer on whilst I was sipping my first brew of the day. Anyway, regarding the first one.......looking at it, I wouldn't have taken it, mate. The simple reason is that, although the signals, as you pointed out, are all pointing towards a good trade, it looked like it was going to be a possible cross-over, so I would have dismissed it. The Guppy LT's were totally compressed right then, anyway, and really you want to see at least the "spine" forming on the right side. By the spine, I mean the dark turquoise 55ma, which is a bit easier to see in cases like this when it's coming out of compression. Which is why I entered the trade I did, WHEN I did......the turquoise ma was starting to show clearly, giving a good indication that Guppy was going to separate. Remember, the LARGEST of the Guppy ma's should also be the FURTHEST away from price, before you consider entering a trade. Trade AWAY from the LT's, and not towards them. Not everybody would agree with that, but I try to keep to that rule. I'll try and come back later, mate, with further comments. Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hello mate, and sorry I didn't reply earlier. No, I'm not outside the UK. (Although, under THIS Government, who knows these days?) I'm well and truly in not-so-merry olde England. If you're also in England, then I haven't a clue why your chart times don't match mine. The times on my chart are always an hour ahead of what I see at the bottom of my screen anyway, so maybe that's the reason. Cheers

--- 帖子 #556 ---
eyevoltage thanks for reply I am also in the UK and as you mentioned I`ve been very close to packing my bags anyway I will take a look at that chart +1hr cheers

--- 帖子 #557 ---
It looks like I totally misunderstood you. I see what you mean about why didn't I enter "short" at the green line? Yes, I see what you're getting at now. Must be old age or summat! The first yellow vertical on my chart below shows where the first indication appeared of a "short" trade (just after the DZ green/blue cross) at the edge of the chart. As you can see in the middle window, the ASH was, at that point, well above the zero line, and the lsma3 was entering the zone at that point. (As the price marched across the screen, of course, both the ASH and the lsma3 moved position, which is very misleading sometimes). If I'd been at the computer watching this, I STILL wouldn't have entered this trade. The reason is simple. Like I hinted before, Guppy plays a big part in our decisions, so it stands to reason that everything must be ok with Guppy before entering the trade. However, it wasn't. Yes, the ST's had crossed below the LT's, but the LT's, although still largely compressed, were still "upside down" for a short trade, if you see what I mean. We need the LT's to "turn over", so that everything is moving in the right direction. Do you see that? The subtleties of any method of trading can take some getting used to, mate, so I don't blame you for taking it all apart and seeing how it works, so to speak. Cheers

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Thanks eye, Just an aside, I'm in the UK (or Gordon Brown world) as well, times on the charts are not to do with were you live, it just depends on where the MT package you use gets its feed from, I use MT4 from North Finance which I think comes from russia and is currently 2 hours difference, theres no way of changing this unfortunately. I think he's surname is very apt with how things are going recently.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
You can download Metatrader from ODL securities who are based in London. Their Mt4 is in our (UK) time.

I am posting this to show anyone new to this thread that although this system is very reliable it isn't 100% accurate... NOTHING IS!!! Sometimes the market turns on a dime without any reason. One thing I love about Dollies indicator window is that it screams for you to get out of a bad trade and this is very useful if you scalp. As a scalper I can't afford to have any 20 pip losses. I'll get back to posting positive trades after this.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Welcome all our friends from the U.K.,as I am from California and envy you all. As I have said here many times, you all are lucky to live in the best time zone of all for trading the forex. Just trade your brains out for a few years and then you can leave where ever you want. My goal is to visit in 2009 for several weeks but I just figured it will cost me triple to live there on vacation than it does here so I need more pips! Glad to see all the new posts.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I was reading through another thread (3 ducks) and I liked the concept of checking your signals over longer timeframes and only go into your trade if they both say the same thing. For me, I am going to confirm my 1min charts with the 15min charts. My main concern will be that if my 1min chart is telling me to go short that the price on the 15min chart is below the guppy and do the same if I am looking to go long. The chart I have attached is the same one from above that I lost 11 pips but is now on the 15min. It clearly shows me that the trend was still short where I went long. I don't have facts but I bet a good deal of my losses would follow this same pattern. I might miss out on a few winners but it would be worth it if I can get my winning percentage even higher.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I love (and hate) the psychology of trading and how people think. It is the battle that I have with myself. In fact this week I was doing some stupid trading so I stopped all trading for the week and watched hundreds of pips go by in the past few days. And I am okay with it as I am learning more about myself and what Dollie's indicators are teaching me. I just saw this video from the moneyshow.com in Las Vegas and I would encourage all of you to see it. Here is the link. I don't know if it will work as you need to be a free member, so if it doesn't work, go to the www.moneyshow.com , free webinars and look for Rob Booker. It was really good. http://www.moneyshow.com/msc/traders...F659852F4&amp;pg=2

thanks for sharing that pirate

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I thought this might be an interesting one to show, taking into account Scorpion's comments regarding signals that look promising, but turn out to be duff. (Like Homer's beer, probably!) The first green vertical shows the DZ showing a nice green/blue cross. Everything's looking good in the middle window, as well, but look at the actual price. It's straddling the Guppy LT's as the ST's drop lower behind it. So basically, if you took the trade, (and for my money, no self-respecting Guppy exponent would have) you'd be trading TOWARDS the 55ema, which is wrong, wrong, wrong! Guppy is, in actual fact, telling you NOT to trade. However, if you take Guppy away, and the pivot lines as well, then you could have profited to the tune of nearly 50 pips. On the other hand, you might not have, because without any indicators, you wouldn't have had a clue WHAT was going on. After the large candle, price ambled along the M2 line until Guppy finally gave us a clear and concise picture that something worthwhile was happening. At the same time, everything looked good with the DZ and the middle window. If I'd took this trade (which I didn't, as I was busy with other things), then my entry would have been just under the M2 line indicated by the yellow arrow, with exit as indicated. Guppy is looking really good by then, once again proving its worth. I've looked at some of my past trades, after Scorpion's questions yesterday, and I realize that, yes, I've been a bit sloppy sometimes in justifying trades. So in actual fact, he's done me a favour, as he's caused me to try and tighten up and pay more attention to what's going on EVERYWHERE (!), as it really does pay in the end.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Great post Eye. I never really paid much attention to Guppy until I read some of your posts and now I use the Guppy and my EMAs as my primary trade action. Everything else supplements what they are saying and confirm the data. I think sometimes people get away from looking at the actual price and what it is doing and focus too much on indicator windows (I am guilty of this as well). This has been a very good week and I hope everyone got their share of the pips. I am posting 2 more charts for this week and I am done and taking a nap (I live in Philly and wake up every morning @ 2am to start trading - Pirate is right... you guys over in Europe are so very lucky). Derm... I started to experiment with the Laguere. It seems to give a strong confirmation when it is running flat at either extreme. Let me know if I am using this correctly. Now for the trades. I got in a 3 trades today (usyen, ausyen, euryen). I started on the 1min charts (as always) and was getting my 4-6 pips but sensed a stronger move so I switched to the 5min charts, saw this was correct and rode it out for over 100pips combined. I'm attaching the EurYen (the best trade) 1min and 5min charts so you can see the difference and how choppy the 1min chart is compared to the nice smooth 5min chart. Have a great weekend everyone!!!!

I've just read all 38 pages about this system and am amazed it hasn't drawn more interest. I will start demoing it early next week. Many thanks to Dollie and Blanca for its early development and Pip Pirate and Eyevoltage for recent improvements. Delage

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I want to welcome you to this post and congradulate you on your successful trading. I know you will be successful by the first post stating that you read all 38 pages. Way to go. Now all the answers you have are in there so we all look forward to your comments.

Here is a shot from yesterday Asian through the US session. The first arrow on the triple hull is at 0GMT when the asian market opens. So it is telling us that a move short may be happening, and as it develops it is a classic example. The second arrow on the zero macd is at 1GMT. Then the pair goes through the london session without much movement, a little retracement, and then in the US session it moves again. The arrow and the red vertical line are at 15 GMT. A continuation of movements from the earlier sessions. See how the triple hull was telling us it might move short again, starting its move short (blue RSI2) at 13 GMT.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
can u send the latest template for this system

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Go to post#296 and beyond to find the indicators. Please read the entire system and paper trade for months to understand it. 99% of the answers to your questions are in the posts. Welcome!

--- 帖子 #572 ---
These are mostly for Eyevoltage as I'm following his system modifications as posted in posts #437 and 438 (hint, hint - harwedar). Others are encouraged to join in, of course. I have downloaded all indicators to their proper place in the trading platform program files and have installed them on the chart, except the dollie guppie indicator, which will not open. Any ideas? Also, how do I place the 10 and 90 lines, in the middle window? In the ASH indicator in the middle window, there is an extra light blue dotted line not in your examples. I assume it isn't necessary, how do I get rid of it? Thanks, Delage

--- 帖子 #573 ---
No zero line in my middle window, either. Delage

--- 帖子 #574 ---
first of all, I'll like to thank dollie, pip pirate, eye voltage, blanc, i swear the list goes on....cant believe i didn't see this thread earlier...well, i guess everything happens for a reason...i hate paper trading. the only time you should paper trade is when your new to a trading platform. its just like borrowing your friend's car when his out of town. your going to be reckless when driving. i read the whole thread and tried it live..and wow 60 pips. i have been trading for 3 months now...spend virtually 18-22 hours watching the market (4real), read alot of books, burnt down 3 accounts. i really think this system will help stop those bastards from taking my money.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Thank you for your post, mate, and I'm sorry you're having a few problems with my mods. I'm not sure what you're referring to when you mention the "dollie guppy indicator", so I can't help you there. In the middle window, you have (or should have) RSI2 (blue line), CCI6 (white dotted line), ASH (Orange line) and the lsma3 (Red, Yellow and Green line). To get the 10 and 90 lines, open the RSI2, click on "Levels" and insert them there. To get the Zero line, open up the CCI6 in the same manner, click on "Levels" and insert a zero in there. That should solve your problems, mate. However, again I'm not sure why you have an extra light-blue line dotted line in the middle window. I'll have to look into that one. Anyway, I'm attaching a template of the Dolly-Guppy that I use. I no longer use the ADX attachment, but if you want it, all you have to do is insert it from your list of indicators. If I find out what that light-blue line is, I'll post another message ASAP. Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Eye, I have easily placed the 10, 90, and zero lines. The light blue dotted line is now solid, I've played around this afternoon with the platform, but is connected with the ASH, as it shows 2 lines. Downloaded new dollie guppy but not in indicator window or on chart, will continue to fiddle with this thing. Delage

--- 帖子 #577 ---
i was studying the dynamic zone rsi and i swear it looks almost exactly like another indicator i know.. its called traders dynamic index. am going to upload the manual so that you guys can understand how it really works..opps the file is too large.. thats the address and u should START reading from PAGE 30 http://www.forexmt4.com/_MT4_Systems...mics/TDI_1.pdf

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Eye, In post #437, you state "the guppy is made up directly from the chart". How is that done? Am I correct in assuming that the dolly guppy. tpl is a template to help make the guppy indicator? Delage

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Eye, The guppy is made of Moving Averages that I attach to the chart, giving each a level and color! Am proceeding, will check back later. Delage

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I have the guppy lines installed! Delage

--- 帖子 #581 ---
My apologies, Delage. I sort of assumed you knew that Guppy was made up of different ma's. The green lines, plus the yellow one, are the short-term ones. The red ones, the blue one and the aqua one are the long-term ones. If you're not sort of "up to speed" with the Guppy thing, then I would recommend you read up on it. Google it and you'll find loads of info that'll help you along. I still don't know what that light-blue dotted line was, mate. Sorry. Good luck. Cheers

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Thanks for the help. I will google the guppy. Delage

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Welcome to the thread Delage and Spotless. This truly is a remarkable system and if you incorporate the Guppys your success rate will be awesome.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Just got through it all, whew...lot's of stuff here. I'm a devout follower of Phillip Nel's 4 hour method and I'm looking at this to compliment that method. I'm interested to see how the DZ sets up with the 4 hr method's moving averages, MACD formations, and trend continuation entries as a filter and as a probable quicker/multiple re-entry into the trend method. Going to need some extra printer cartridges I guess... eyevoltage: What time of day do you use to calculate your pivots? I've used 5pm EST USA and midnight but lean towards midnight to calculate them. Can you post the pivot indicator as well? I think you stated that you mainly trade off of the 5min chart but the majority of your screenshots look like 15min charts. My guess is if the 5miin is stuck in a range you venture towards the 15min to give the charts some breathing room to get going or it's a matter of what feels better (instinct) at the time. I've never used the Guppy set-up. Can you give a brief explanation, if there ever was such a thing with trading, on how this should be used or should I just Google it and take it from there. Again, the DZ and the LSMA 'patience factor' looks very interesting.... Now I just have to go through the list of all the indicators I downloaded from this thread to pick out the ones I actually need..templates too.... pip pirate: thanks for all the work you have done here as well including Dollie and Blanca for their initial work.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
If you have any extra lines that shouldn't be on the indicators just go into each indicators colour settings, find the one you don't want and change the colour to "none"

--- 帖子 #586 ---
ladies and gentlemen....i think dollie has found the holy grail. am new to this thread and i was studying it when suddenly DAM!!!! almost all currency pairs started acting fun. i went long on GBP/JPY and i made 190 PIPS!!!!.i couldn't sleep yesterday.. and eyevoltage i think am in the best trading time zone (gmt+1). an hour ahead of you guys (west africa).

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Where was your entry spotless, was it the first arrow on your chart, for consistant good trades make sure you also follow the guppy rules as laid out by eyevoltage, you at least need the ST guppies to be fanning out before entry to be safe.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
your right scorpion, but i have been trading with the dynamic zone rsi also known as trader dynamic index for almost 2 months and the setup to me was right.. sometimes, what i do is when i see a setup like that, i enter the trade and let my indicators proof to me that i was right.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hi my old 5min partner Great to see that you are doing well with Dollie. I wish you could have met her. I've enjoyed talking to her on Skype and I still value inputs from a few months ago. Unfortunately I cannot contact her anymore because I want to thank her again (hopefully she's reading this - thanks Ger!!!!! Hope you are still making money as you have done previously.) Yesterday I saw your visit to our old meeting place - Philip's five-minute system. So glad to see that you are still paying us a visit - I am doing the very same on the site. Don't think I have stopped following this system - I was just teaching myself the other five-minute system. I do feel comfortable with that now. Just to say thank you for the template posted - I will surely use it. I still keep an eye on the Dollie charts before I enter using Philips five-minute system. Just one question - did you change now to the 15 minutes or you still using the 5 minutes charts? Talk to you again

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Palmer, I don't calculate my pivots. I use an excellent indicator that automatically calculates and draws the lines on my chart at 23:00 here in the UK, but 00:00 on my chart. The resultant lines seem to work very well, so I haven't bothered altering the settings at all. If you want it, have a look in the attachment list and download it from there. It'll save me posting it again! It's called MultiplePivotsV2. Yes, I did lean towards the 5m charts, but as you've pointed out, I tend to follow the 15m charts now, as they give one a bit more time to weigh things up, so to speak. However, this method seems to work in any TF, with one of our thread members scalping on the 1m charts! Regarding Guppy.......basically, it consists of short-term ma's and long-term ma's. On my charts, you'll see ST's in green and the LT's in red. The basic idea is that the ST's represent the "traders" of the world and the LT's the "investors" or "position" traders. When the two sets start moving apart, forming a nice gap between them, that's a signal that a strong trend is developing. Obviously, the LT's will be steadier and less inclined to deviate from their chosen course of action, but the ST's, as can be expected, WILL deviate periodically. When this happens, one sometimes sees a quite obvious trading opportunity forming in the shape of a pull-back, and Guppy makes it VERY obvious! That's the beauty of Guppy. It's VERY visual, and one can hardly miss the signals it gives out. In short, for me, Dollie and Guppy complement one another very nicely indeed. Palmer, I've barely scratched the surface with Guppy. I recommend you read the Guppy threads on FF, and also Google it to get a more complete picture. Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Thanks for the post, Willem, and nice to hear from you again. Yes, I usually visit the 5minIntraday every day and see what's going on. You're still posting your awesome charts, mate, and I don't see how anybody could fail to learn from them, along with your excellent analysis. I honestly don't know where you get the time from, mate, what with your lecturing, golf and taking your good lady wife out on regular occasions!! Yes, this system of Dollie's is truly awesome. It always was, right from the beginning. As a stand-alone method, it's a brilliant piece of work, but I guess it's human nature to want to tweak it here and there, isn't it? As brilliant as Dollie's method is, I just found a way that made it that wee bit better for ME, mate, and I really do hope that she didn't mind me tinkering with her brain-child. Oh, and to answer your question, I tend to use the 15m chart mostly now, mate, but I sort of swap between that and the 5m, checking each out as the mood takes me! To prove how good Dollie's method is, Willem, Pip Pirate2 keeps popping in here and there with his 1H and 4H charts, especially for those amongst us who prefer the longer TF touch, and he goes out of his way to make sure that the explanation is clear and concise enough for us to see what's going on. You're welcome re the template, Willem. Good luck with it, and we'll talk again soon. Cheers

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Just to demonstrate the visual effect of Guppy, have a look at this chart from this morning. I didn't actually trade this, but had I been in front of the screen, I would have done. This demonstrates how, if, for some reason, you've missed the first chance (blue rectangle) to fill your boots, Guppy shows you ANOTHER one! After the first chance, a nice pull-back forms, but what makes it especially attractive is that nearly all of the ST's are STILL nicely separated, even when the doji forms at the bottom. A quick check with the excellent DZ and the middle window shows that Dollie fully approves of us getting in during the first or second vertical yellow line. Exit would have been on, or just before, the M5 line, with a nice pocketful of pips to send you on your merry way!!

--- 帖子 #593 ---
eyevoltage: Thanks for posting that last template...the 'complete' template... I'm away from my notes that I took last night. Can someone refer me to the post that explains how to interpret the Dynamic Zone RSI? Thanks

--- 帖子 #594 ---
No problems, mate. I think you might be referring to post #577 regarding a description of the DZ. Bear in mind that it's something slightly different from the Dollie DZ, but the description of how it works is very similar, and is very good indeed. Cheers

--- 帖子 #595 ---
If you follow on from my last Cable example, you'll see that the Guppy LT's continued to steadily climb, with the ST's gradually dipping until they were totally compressed. At that point, you'll see a hammer candle with its shadow reaching down to slightly touch the 35ema of the LT's. That proved to be the support that launched the ST's upwards again, and if you check the DZ and the middle window situation out, you'll see Dollie again giving her approval. Entry would have been at the next candle, just as it passed the R2 line. (You'll notice also that the Guppy LT pattern hasn't changed. All the ma's are still nicely separated and still showing a strong upward trend, supporting our decision to enter the trade). The spinning top just after entry might look as if it's going to throw a spanner in the works, but with the Guppy ST's starting to spread again, we can discount it whilst keeping a weather eye on things. Exit anywhere on the candle indicated by the second yellow arrow, as lsma3 departs from the orange/blue zone. Ho-Hum!! These trades do seem to be appearing with almost monotonous regularity, don't they? Rather like utility bills, but a lot more pleasant to look at!!

--- 帖子 #596 ---
i don't know what to say...u really know how to explain things perfectly. Did you enter that trade?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
its true with you say about the guppies....just learnt it the hard way... -14 pips. the remarkable thing is this system will tell you when you need to get out if you entered a bad trade.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
wow...after reading the eyevoltage posts on guppy, i sprung into action and tried it out on GBP/JPY. Got rewarded with 24 pips..would have been more but i used trailing stop and i got stopped.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I'm pretty busy most of the time, mate, so although the screen is on, there are only certain times I can actually sit down and trade. Consequently, some of these opportunities pass me by, but I find later, when I've got more time, it's nice to put them up on the forum in the hope that the examples will benefit other folk on here. I know that I like to see how other people on here are doing, by looking at THEIR charts, so I like to repay the favour, so to speak. Looking at recent posts on this thread, it's nice to see some of you actually taking money of those nasty brokers!! Cheers

For the 2 or 3 people that were here on this thread a few months ago, I posted that this thread was dead and I was out of here. There would be one or two posts a week. Now look at it! I always believed in dollie's system, and its slight variations, but figured that no one else saw it and it was time to quit posting. Now the site is out of control. I love it. Thanks for all the new people posting. Now here is a move last night (around 3 GMT) during the asian session. No I didn't get it all but I did get 36 of it. It was against the overall trend and I was late to the party and really didn't believe it was going to run this far. So much for thinking! Must trust indicators, must trust indicators.....

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Pip Pirate, I took a look at this thread several months ago and I was frightened off by the numerous indicators, as a newbie, it was too much to comprehend. However with eyevoltage's modifications in reducing and refining the indicators the system has become much less intimidating. Thanks to you and he for carrying it along, it's really an exceptional system that deserves more attention. Delage

--- 帖子 #602 ---
thanks eyevoltage for your modifications but i get confused and i do not know excatly ... when can i go long and when can i go short i need the rules for enter and exit and the best TF tanks again

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Ziko... welcome to the thread. Attached is a trade I just got out of on the gbp/jpy cross for 70 pips. I removed all the other indicators except for the Dollie window so you can clearly see how a setup should be based on the original Dollie method. I encourage you to watch the charts for a few days just so you can see how these indicators interact with each other. Then you can add any other indicators you feel necessary and begin trading.

Good post, mate, and a great chart to accompany it. I can see that all this activity has taken your breath away, as it has mine!! Word gets about, it seems. Now about your chart. I take it that the arrows indicate where you took the trade? Starting above the ADX (which I don't take much notice of these days, to be honest.) I see that the DZ green has just crossed the blue. In the MACD window, I see a negative block and then it turns positive. In the chart window, price seems to have bottomed, with the HMA starting to curl up and changing colour. I take it that you entered at the open of the large candle to the right of the arrow. Hope I'm right so far. However, I'm still puzzled by that damn Triple Hull. Please tell me, if you will, what is happening around that red arrow, and what it is that makes the trade. It's the only part of that chart that continues to mystify me, me old mate, so I would really appreciate a blow-by-blow account of what's happening in Triple Hull and what it is that triggers the trade. I hope that you and your good lady wife are both in good health? Are those 49'ers gonna get any better any time soon? I had the dubious pleasure of watching my Vikings get absolutely whupped by the Packers last week, and it was painful to watch. A good win for them this week though against the Raiders. Cheers for now, mate.

I can understand your confusion, mate, but the chart posted by jcblcs79 will help you a lot, as the heart of the Dollie system lies within that indicator window under his chart window. Entry and exit points were (and still are) pin-pointed in that indicator window. Can I ask you if you've read the thread from the very first post? If you read Dollie's original rules and apply them to the multitude of charts on this thread, I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time. As far as I can see, this method works in all TF's, mate, but I tend to stick to the short-term ones like 5m and 15m. Good luck with your trading. Cheers

Oh do I wish that I entered the trade at the arrows. No I missed the beginning of this move and that is why I didn't get that many pips. Okay, the triple hull. What the blue line (RSI 2) on the triple hull tells me is that a move long is coming soon. The angle of the blue line is very important, as you want it steep. So you can see that the blue line started moving long 2 hours before the nice candle long. It's telling you 2 hours in advance that a move may happen. Now you know it also gives a lot of false signals. So next you have to see if the other dotted lines are following the blue line in the same angle and close to the blue line. This works best when it is starting from the bottom or top of the chart. Then the ISMA line should follow the blue line in a similar angle but it lags the others. I use the ISMA like a moving average. so the purpose of the triple hull et all indicators is to alert me to a potential trade ahead of time. With a H1 or H4 chart you are not going to get that many possibilities in a day. But had I caught that whole move it was 200 pips. I have seen 3 moves like that this week where I would be up over 500 pips. Just look at the gbp/jpy charts. No buy, sell or hold recommendations. Newbies should stay far away from that pair as it will kill you. Patience. Eyevoltage, I don't like dollie's first version (which all of you guys use) of what is now the triple hull. I could never understand it so when she came out with the triple hull I saw it immediately. You want to look for that formation that I showed you. Set up another chart with it on post #296 and see if you like it. The macd pattern is if there is a flat or almost none existant bar then I am excited. It is usually like a spring ready to go. Then you add the DZ and we have a trade coming. I don't use the ADX very often. The HMA color moving average is also become very important to me as an indicator, esp on the longer time frames. It will usually tell when the trend is turning, but is most reliable during the more active times. It can give false signals say between the US and asian sessions when there isn't much activity. Wife and I are fine and the 49ers suck.

Something wierd with the chart size and the indicator plots... When the 5min EURUSD chart is viewed full screen the LSMA is above the zero line in a totally different position. When the chart size is reduced the LSMA is below the 10 line. See screen shots...full screen is the first chart. I had to use a screen capture utility to save the chart; when saving in MT4 the difference is not shown. This is a huge difference, which one is correct??? Pay no attention about the entry, this is from a different method... Either way, something isn't right....the absolute strength histo (orange line) plots differently also...

--- 帖子 #609 ---
With the Dollie indicators when you build the window the RSI goes on first and is fixed at its normal scale of 0-100, then the CCI, AS, and lsma go on. They as you may know use different scales, the CCI can go anywhere from +300 to -300, the AS scale is in decimals, and the lsma scale is the actual pip value. So you will see that if you scroll the chart backwards and forward some days all of the indicators except for the RSI move around somewhat, especially the lsma which when scrolling looks to have a mind of its own., and to a lesser extent the AS. Its not a problem when trading and watching live, but that is the reason that it is hard to back test this method. Just stick to one scale and watch live and you will not have a problem, the zoom that eyevoltage uses is the best and has proven to show solid signals time and again, just remember that if you want to screen capture a trade you have taken you need to do it immediately or things will look differently as the market continues to move. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I follow this thread with interest. Tried it and got some pips (a few on LIVE account and with minilots to see what happen) so i'm really happy to stay with you what about stop loss on the eyevoltage's version ?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Eye voltage....i know you don't have the time to sit in front of you system..i think you should check out the 4 hour time frame..dollie+guppy is FANTASTIC on that time frame..on the 4 hour chart dollie doesn't flick a lot and i think she gives good long term signals on that time frame.. check out GBP/USD on the 4 hour.. currently up 80 pips ...oppps make that 72pips.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Without realizing it, you've managed to jog my memory regarding SL's on my charts. I found the attached indicator on another thread. It automatically calculates 70% of ATR and the resultant figure makes quite a handy SL. In short, it calculates an SL for you, if you can't be bothered doing it for yourself. When you download the indicator and run it, you might find you have a blank window at the bottom of your screen, and all you'll see is the words "70% of ATR (14) 19.0000" (for example). It defaults to 13, actually, but change it to 14 instead. This info appears at the top of your screen also, so you can compress the ATR window to save space, if you like. You can, of course, ignore the indicator's findings, but I've found that it gives you a nice starting figure to work around. Cheers

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Thank you for the info, mate, and I truly appreciate you taking the time to send the post. I'll have to consider going to a higher TF ! Cheers

--- 帖子 #614 ---
nice system! i'm trying it. Few questions: do you use default settings for dollie's indicator? and which settings for laguerre? why you use only a MA and not the LT's ma of eyevoltage? (violet one)

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Whilst spotless was filling his boots on the 4H Cable, this is what it looked like on the 15m chart. After a classic crossover and pull-back, both Dollie and Guppy are literally in harmony with one another. The DZ and the middle window are giving out positive signals, and the Guppy ST's are separating as the LT's complete their flip over to continue downwards. Entry on the first yellow vertical, but only after a breach of the Pivot line. Then, it's all systems go until exiting anywhere within those 4 yellow vertical lines, as RSI2 and lsma3 are now languishing in OS territory.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I'm 2 for 2 for a total of about 50 pips on the EURJPY and EURUSD...

--- 帖子 #617 ---
thx eyevoltage

--- 帖子 #618 ---
what's the system you used?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
eyevoltage's set-up.... make that 3 for 3 about 120 pips with the current EURUSD run with what I have locked in. Price having trouble with the m3 barrier...

--- 帖子 #620 ---
where exactly did you enter??

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hi Palmer Well done! Go for my record of 12 out of 12 with the Dollie system. I thing No 13 was a negative trade. And that was without Guppy. Now you can see why I am so sad that Dollie is not here to see the/her success.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi PP2 I do remember that post specificially. You were ......up with the thread. I told you keep it up and please stay with us. I also believe this is a very sound system - just a bit complicated at first but one just needs to work through it. I was just busy with another 5min system - which I am more comfortable now. Thank you very much for staying with us and well done with the progress. Hopefully you'll see more of me in future.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
another guppy+dollie trade i made...got out at R2...36pips in the bag..

--- 帖子 #624 ---
I entered via the 5min chart. I can post a chart later, I've 'shut down' for the day. But, I will be incorporating Phillip Nel's, method with this as well as far as the trend direction goes. So, even if the Guppy's might be showing one thing, I may be using P. Nel's 4hr and 1hr trend direction as the overall trend.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
The Original Dollie (with the guppy) gives multiple signals a day with a very high success rate. The only time I can recall getting reversed and taking a big loss (15 pips for me is a big loss) is during a major news release at the start of the US open. I tend to stay away from trades before these times (unless I am already in a very profitable trade +30pips, then I set a 15 pip SL). I tend to let my profits run until Dollie tells me to exit. That is also the beauty of this system. The Guppy and Dollie let you enter a trade with confidence and then Dollie Screams for you to get out of the trade. The more you trade with this system the more you forget about the others. I have been doing a lot of research on Guppy and am amazed. Although the creator Daryl developed this for Stocks it truly is valuable for the Forex Market. Attached are a few articles I have recently found and read on Guppy. I encourage everyone new to Guppy to read these. They give good insight.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Here is a 35 pip gain I just got where all the indicators lined up perfectly. I love when my chart looks like this!!!!

--- 帖子 #627 ---
After reading those materials on guppy, i looked at my charts and WOW!!! everything became clearer. did some back test using strategy tester and discovered that guppy really really REALLY works ... thanks for sharing Jcblcs

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Guppy is truly amazing and I am grateful that eyevoltage started using it because it led to me researching GMMA and finally getting an understanding of the market. I am as guilty as anyone who has used indicators and not having a clue of why they are working. After reading the GMMA articles (there are a ton - just google it) my charts seem so much clearer. Daryl is quoted as saying that his GMMA do not give accurate buy and exit points just an overall view of the market. That is where Dollie comes in and to me it is a perfect marriage. Attached is a 2 pip loss I just took. I am posting this because I want everyone to see what I mean when I say "Dollie Screams for you to get out of a potentially bad trade". Ultimately it comes down to discipline. Could this trade come back and become profitable - yes. But it could also continue on its path and lead to 10 - 15 pip loss. I like to keep my losses small.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
2 pip loss

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Attached are two trades I just got out of: Gbp and Eur Yen crosses. Again... everything says go from the guppy all the way down to the ADX. I love this system!!!

--- 帖子 #631 ---
i think i read somewhere in the post that if the white line goes up before the blue line, you shouldn't go for the trade.the white line has to be in the middle of the blue and pink lines.maybe am mistaking things. (1st red arrow) the white line came before the blue line and at the second candle you entered the trade... (2nd red arrow) the blue line came before the white line ....lets see how it goes..

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Here's my entry from this morning, white vertical line. Note: As I stated I follow Phillip Nel's method as well. Per that method, price action was riding the 8 EMA to the upside so this provided me even more verification of a long entry.... See ya next week....

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I do apologize for not replying sooner, mate, but I've been studying your chart and reading your comments above, and trying to sort it all out. I think I'm starting to understand you re the Triple Hull. Basically, we're looking for a nice steep-angled blue RSI2 starting from an OB or an OS position, then look for the dotted line indicators to closely follow it. Then the lsma3 needs to take the same route as the RSI2, albeit in a lagging position. Yes, I definitely think the fog is clearing! Many thanks for your detailed explanation, Pirate. I'm sure it will help others on here as well, should any of them be interested in pursuing the longer TF's with this method. In actual fact, it was suggested to me earlier that I try my hand at the 4H charts, using this Dollie-Guppy method, seeing as I can't be at the screen all the time. It's a suggestion worth thinking about, and of course, it raises the interesting question of which of the two methods would be the most effective up there? With regard to this thread, I'm just like you, mate. I'm gob-smacked at all the activity all of a sudden. It really does make a nice change, especially seeing other folks' chart examples. Even better, they seem to be making plenty of pips as well, which is nice. Take care, me old mate, and thanks again for your time and effort. Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
You have the triple hull figured out. I will be posting more charts in the coming weeks. I think the H1 chart could work for you just fine. When you get up, look at the charts with this in mind, as I have been seeing lately that the late asian session has been setting up the london session. So you might see the triple hull making a move first, and then the move on the other indicators. I would encourage you also trade other pairs beside the pound or at least look at them. Well I'm off to cook our Thanksgiving turkey (no I'm not the turkey) so I have decided to take the next few days off until Sunday. And I am grateful to all of you out there in dollie land and wish the best for the rest of the year. I keep on fighting for the things I want; Though I know that when you’ve dead you can’t; But I’d rather be a free man in my grave; than living as a puppet or a slave; So as sure as the sun will shine; I’m going to get my share of what is mine…..

Hello everybody. I'm looking for a RSI indicator for Metatrader 4 which sits directly on the chart and not in a separate window below the chart. I want to combine it with bollinger bands. does anybody know where I could find it? thanks

--- 帖子 #636 ---
A little while ago, I came across an ingenious little indicator that some of you may be interested in. I'd forgotten about it, to be honest, but discovered it by accident amongst all my other MT4 custom indicators. It's called "periodcon" and it does what most people say you can't do to MT4 charts, and that's customise the TF's. Basically, here's what you do: 1) Open whatever chart you want to convert....1m 5m 15m 30m etc. Say for this example you open GBPUSD 5m. 2) Open periodcon from your list of custom indicators. 3) Click "period multiplier" and change to (say) 4. 4) Click OK. 5) Click File/Open Offline. 6) Scroll down the list to the chart you wanted i.e. GBPUSD20 (4 X 5M). 7) Click "Open". 8) On chart that appears, load the required template. That's it! You can now work on your GBPUSD 20m chart. This converter will convert any of the MT4 charts to virtually whatever you want. For instance, if you feel that 4H isn't quite what you want, but Daily is far too long, there's nothing in between to compromise, is there? So bring up a 4H chart, set the periodcon to 2 (it defaults to that, anyway), follow the instructions above, and you'll have a nice GBPUSD 8H chart to play with! Happy experimenting!

What happened to Dollie? Nothing bad I hope? Topgun

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Dollie is fine. She hasn't posted in months but is doing well I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I just want to post so we get this great thread to the top of the list... I would hate to see this great system on page 2!!!!

--- 帖子 #640 ---
I am constantly looking over new systems and think I came across one that might be of interest for everyone involving Bollinger Bands squeeze. Please see the ForexFactory Post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=57426 for details. I still am using Dollie's original setup as my primary indicator but am using the squeeze as a way to tell me that a move is coming. Attached is a trade I just got out of showing a great example of the squeeze followed by Dollie. I hope this helps and does not confuse anyone.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi, This indic does not take care of the sell signals why? Is it only Buy signals we would be looking out for? Looking forward tp reading your explaination on that. Arnold

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Attached is another 30+ pip profit. I started on the 1min chart (as I always do) but switched to the 5min chart while in the trade because everything said go and it paid off by at least 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Welcome to the thread. Dollie was simply telling one side of the story, as the sell signals are the reverse. I can see that you are new to FF, so I will ask a favor. Please we are not being rude, but we ask everyone who is interested in this fantasic system to read the entire thread, paper trade it first for a month or more, and you will learn so much. 99% of the questions you will ask have already been answered. It seems to be complicated at first but it will make sense. Look forward to your future posts.

How long does Thanksgiving last anyway? I always thought it was just one day! jcblcs79........not criticizing or anything, mate, but that BB thing looks awfully complicated. It's very impressive, no doubt about it, and I wish you luck with it, but for me, it's starting to take the "simplicity" away from Dollie's original system. But hey, that's just me, mate. Good luck and I hope you harvest loads of pips with it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #645 ---
The market can seduce you to sleep just like a woman. Nothing was happening right before the london session so I decided to go to sleep. Me so dumb. The gbp/jpy moves over 300 pips while cable moves 50. Here is an example on the H1 chart where the triple hull doesn't look great but there is a flat macd before the move, the DZ is perfect, and surprise: the ADX actually looks great. See how the ADX has the green line go through the blue and pink at the start of the move. That is an excellent sign to take the trade. Notice also on the triple hull, the RSI 2 blue line, look at when it is overbought or oversold. See how that seems to be the peak of the move and then the reversal starts. It is not 100% but something to look at. Also see how the 15 min chart looks great also, including the ADX. This is why I encourage my friends out there to think about longer time frames. Just get one of these moves a week.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Eyevoltage - Thanks so much for posting that indicator of yours that makes it possible to produce a 10 minute chart or a 2 H chart. I do find that very useful and use it now all the time. My trading has improved a lot since I can see more tf charts.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I'm happy to be of service. If it's increased your pip intake then it was all worthwhile. Just out of curiosity, do you happen to be Hello Dollie, the originator of this thread? Just wondering........... Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Lol Yes its me ! :-) I had great difficulties in the past to log on, I can read the postings but couldnt post. Today I made a huge effort to set my User Control Panel to a setting where I can actually log in. Thanks to all who kept this thread alive and for all the positive feedback on this system to make it even better. Lately I almost exclusively trade the EuroYen with good results. I find that the spread is better and it moves a little bit more than the GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Post # 560 on page 38 of this thread refers: Dear jcblcs79 You wrote "Losing Trade I am posting this to show anyone new to this thread that although this system is very reliable it isn't 100% accurate... NOTHING IS!!! " I want to share with you that before you enter, you need to be aware of Overbought and Oversold conditions and keep that in mind. That is why part of the rules of this system is to have horisontal lines on levels 90 and 10. If you had overlaid the 90 and the 10 lines on your chart, you would have seen that it shows Overbought and it was not a good idea to buy when all 3 lines are high up there near the top, its already overbought. Hope this helps to clear up for you why that was a losing trade.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
It's a real pleasure meeting you at last, and to have the opportunity of thanking you for sharing such a wonderful method of trading. At the same time, I do hope that you didn't mind the tweaks here and there that were made to your brain-child? I like to refer to it as "method evolving", as I'm sure that everyone does a little bit of adjusting and refining to any system they come across, in order to make it work that bit better for themselves. I enjoyed reading the thread from the start, and like pip pirate2, I was disappointed that it seemed to grind to a halt. Which is why I started posting charts of how I traded your method, in the hope that it would stimulate some fresh interest. At the same time, pip pirate2 was doing the same with his 1H and 4H "dollie's new method" charts, at the same time helping me along with understanding how it all worked. Anyway, it's about time I hit the sack.................2.20am here in the UK! By the way, we think alike in that we seem to have a keen interest in EUR/JPY and Cable. They're the main two that I like to keep an eye on. See you again soon, I hope. Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
I am going to add those lines to my RSI and keep an eye on that. It is great to have you back here and hope you can continue to add to the great thread. I said it in an earlier post but I'll say it again... Your original Setup saved my account. I have been scoring many green pips as of late and plan on doing so for the foreseeable future.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hi Dollie Wellcome back. Nice to see you again. I thought I frustrated you so much last time we talked that you decided to not be associated with "stupid" newbies like me (LOL). Don't worry, it's going much better now. So glad you are back. Keep it up - from the old-Kovsie.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Glad to see you posting again. I have been trying to keep this wonderful system alive for more people to see it and understand it. On the flip side, I have been fighting my own scalping demons (just my opinion of my trading behavior as it doesn't work for me but may work for you) and should have listened to you a long time ago about trading the H1 and H4. I'm closer to success in that area. I'm making all of this too hard and need to get out of my head and just trade. Thanks again for this system.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Here is a perfect trade based on the Dollie I just got out of. I have incorporated the 10 and 90 levels and used them as my exit. Based on this trade the LSMA and RSI were telling me that this pair was becoming overbought.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
good work ... but i want to know the setting ( input) of your LSMA GOOD LUCK

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I set my LSMA to 10. It's default setting is 5 but it changed colors too much for me. I personally feel LSMA 10 gives more of a flow. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Excellent trade! Have you explored instead of the usd/cad looking at the eur/cad? Much better pair. That same move had the eur/cad open at 1.4657 and peak at 1.4745, for 80-90 pips. I like to share the eur/cad (and eur/aud) with others. Just a thought but you still have pips. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
A nice trade with a nice result. I don't usually watch this pair, but I'll have to take notice of it in future. I also like how you sat up and took notice of Dollie's advice re the OB and OS zones. Paid off big time for you, mate, eh? Re your comment re the lsma3 and its setting. I have to admit that I've never thought of altering it before, but I just tried it and it smooths it out a lot more, which is more pleasing to the eye. However, I stand by my comments re the lsma3 in that it's always late giving an entry signal for a short trade. Long trades are not usually a problem, but for some reason, it just seems to be lagging a lot more. What I do is wait for the RSI2/CCI6 to cross down through the zero line and then enter, irrespective of the lsma3, and it usually does the trick. I remember Dollie saying how once the RSI2 and the CCI6 had crossed, then the trade was usually a safe one. The lsma3 still gives a good exit signal as it exits the pink/blue zone and, as you demonstrated, even better when it's in the OB (or the OS) zone!! All in all, nice one, mate. Cheers

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Thanks guys!!! Pirate, I use StrategyBuilderFX for charts and they do not have the Eur/Cad cross (I trade on MB Trading and they don't offer charts). What charting service do you use? Eye, I don't think it is the LSMA that lags on a short but the Absolute Strength that causes this problem. For whatever reason it is rare to see the "purple line" spike up over the Zero Line and then stay there especially during real time trading. I'm with you and refer to the CCI to confirm when I enter a short. My basic strategy is too look over all the charts previous 3 - 4 days to see which are the most volatile and then ride those until they get flat and then move on. It just so happens that the USD/CAD has been moving a lot lately as is the Eur/Yen and the always scary GPB/YEN.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Hey: I use Interbankfx for my trading platform. It's a meta 4 platform. I know that MB trading does trade the eur/cad. If you are interested I will teach a little bit more on that pair. What time zone (in GMT if you like) are you in? The cad pairs move a lot before the US session.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I am always interested in learning new things. I live in Philadelphia (US Eastern) but trade at all different times. I try to get up early (4amUS Eastern) to trade the European and US Market but that doesn't always work. I find myself trading the Australian and Asian Markets more and more (7pm - 10pm Eastern US Time).

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Attached is a eur/yen trade I recently got out of. I have 2 charts posted. The first chart has the LSMA set at 10 (what I always use) and the 2nd where the LSMA is set at 5. You can clearly see the difference.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Great. Watch the eur/cad for their unemployment news. It is usually the same day as the US at 12GMT. Think about it. All the traders in london and the early US session have nothing to do but wait for NFP. So when the cad news hits before NFP, there can be some good action. The Canadians haven't been good on what the forecast number will be so sometimes the market moves. It is a pair that also can channel for a while with big channels. Study it and I think you will like it.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
This morning I decided to re-read Dollies original post and her rules and one thing that jumped out at me was the emphasis of the CCI. Dollie clearly says " Its very safe when blue and white line trades almost on top of each other and going sharply in the same direction through 0". Now I know that I sometimes focus on the RSI ASH and LSMA and forget the importance of the CCI. Well today I made sure I only entered trades where the CCI hugged the RSI as they cut through the zero line and was 8 for 8 in scalping trades today. The moral of the story.... This system is very reliable and thought out. If you stick to all of the rules you will be successful.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hi JC I also liked the original rules and I had a run of 12 consecutive positive trades. The charts are posted on Page 18 through to page 24. I used a 30 minute chart and I do concentrate on only 4 pairs. But then I started training myself on another five-minute system which I am now more comfortably with. I think now is the time to combine the three systems I am working on. I think it is great to have a five-minute scalping system, that Dolly 30 minute and another 4h system. I think that is a well balanced system and it will get you the necessary direction. Enjoy the trading - like I always said.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Attaced is a interesting indicator I saw on another thread. It is a multi timeframe ADX. It gives you a numerical strength of a specific cross at 5min, 15min, 1hour, 4 hour and Daily. This could be useful for those of us who scalp and are constantly switching timeframes. I just got this today and am going to keep an eye on it over the next few weeks to see how it works and its accuracy.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Can someone advise on how to overlay all the indicators into one window. I know for those who know how do to it it is very simple but for those who nanot figure it out it is very frustating.

We all have been newbies at one time so we are happy to have you on board. Here is how to do it: (I assume you have a meta 4 trade platform) Click on the indicator you want to start with, and drag it to your chart. It will put it in your chart. Make any corrections that you need to. Then find the next indicator you want, click on it and drag it on top of the indicator that you have already installed. That's it. Don't worry be happy on this thread as you are on your way to great trading if you stick with us.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Why don't you just download the templates, it has the indicators you need? Click on Navigator icon, find your indicator and drag to your chart. If you want to overlay, for that indicator Parameters tab: Apply to: First Indicator's Window.....

No I didn't get this move but wanted to show why the exotics can be where it is at when the majors aren't moving. I have been trying to stay just on the H1 and H4 charts, but realize I have to be more flexible and look at all the charts to see the moves coming.This move really started during the US session with a AUD retail sales even during the asian session. One could have entered in the US session, and then you would have been up a little before the news since we don't know which way the market would have gone. It went long and then flat until the london session. Total move: 250 pips.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I posted a few posts ago about why I think some of you should look at this pair. As we know there was a CAD interest rate move. Look at this chart: Just like the Eur/Aud chart above, you could have gotten in at 11GMT and let it ride. Over 220 pips.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Let's see: Eur/Aud moved 250 (including the US session), Eur/Cad moved 220, the Gbp/Jpy moves 150, and Gbp/Chf moves 300. And some wonder why I want to be in the UK time zone. My scalping friends, please look at this.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Pirate... I have taken your advice and have been watching the Eur/Cad and it just paid off with a 20 pip scalp. See attached for details. I don't know if it just me but I don't seem to be trading any US pairs anymore. My pairs of choice currently are Eur/yen, Aus/yen, Eur/Aus and now Eur/Cad.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
This system looks excellent. I am looking forward to demo trading it and hopefully there will be more activity and posts here for us. thanks for sharing Rob Longboat

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Glad to see your success. I just "discovered" the AUD/JPY and have been tracking it. When the US pairs are flat, always look to the exotics. What I love about forex is my belief that someone out there always wants to make money with some pair. So it may be slow for a day, but then the big boys say "let's move something". CAD unemployment is friday and let me tell you, if it moves, it's fast. we shall see.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Pirate... I think I might be in love. When this pair starts to move the pips are a plenty. Thanks for turning me on to this pair.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Attached are 2 trades I just got scalped - Aus/Yen &amp; Eur/Yen. If you notice on both of these trades and my earlier trade today the ADX for the 5min, 15min, &amp; 1hour were all either green or red confirming the direction of price movement. I know I have only been using this recently but the correlation of the three timeframes allows me to enter my trades with even more confidence. Now if you trade on the longer timeframes you could probably use this as a good entry point.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
I walked away from the computer and returned only to see this great setup pass me by. Anyway, I'm going to post it for it is a great example of everything working together on the Eur/Cad pair.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Last post of the day. Well I got some of that Eur/Cad move after a small pullback. I am posting this trade because for those who scalp the 1min charts, this is what you should expect. I mostly post my big wins and that could be misleading. When you scalp you should aim for 8 - 10 pips. Now if you can sense a larger a move then stay with it but that is completely discretionary.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Just to prove my point I want to post the eur/cad right after I got out of it. I got lucky and got out with positive pips. At worst I would have broke even. Once I am up 8 - 10 pips I set my SL to break even. Again... when you scalp you have to be quick, decisive and go for small quick gains.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
My first trade in a long time using Dolly system but I've combined it with the Guppy system like EyeVoltage. As always I do save copies of my trades - for this one I did save the copies for my entry and exit points to be reviewed later. The first chart is exactly my entry point and their second chart is exactly where I exited the trade (just below the M1 line). The entry was may be too early but the Isma was where I want it to be. Ideally it should come from below the 0-line. 26pips profit - not too bad for a first time.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Attached is a perfect trade I just got out of. See attached for details.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
sorry... here is the chart

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Here is a more aggresive trade I just took that paid off. Dollie wasn't perfect. When I enter a trade Like this I truly am in scalp mode. 5 - 10 pips are my target.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
hi jcblcs79 could see you are around and with the aggresive entries on GU i guess that dollie pays off for scalping . Well i have been reading the thread few days ago but am afraid of a lot of indicators but later got interested as it looks a little bit clearer to me. could you pls let me have those indicators as it is in your GU chart or if the tpl is available,sorry for any inconvinience cos i think there is some diiference in the golfer or am making a mistake.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hello Ras and welcome to the thread. I use Dollie's original setup (my first indicator window) and the custom indicators are posted on page 1. The rest are standard. The 2nd indicator window is the Laguerre. I got this from Imran's 5min Scalping thread. He uses 2 Lags where I only use one (the 2nd Lag). Please reference his thread for more details. I don't want to take credit for his work. I also got the 60 and 200 EMA from this thread. You'll also see that I use the short GMMA. I'll post that indicator. If you google Guppy you'll find all the info you need on that subject. I encourage you do read that. I also believe I posted a few articles on guppy. I have recently incorportated a multi-time frame ADX (For more info on ADX go to Investopedia). I am now trading when I have agreement from the 5min, 15min &amp; 1hour. Obviously the more aggresive you want to trade the less confirmation you'll take and if you want to be ultra conservative you can wait until you have full agreement all of the way up to the daily TF. Finally, I don't recommend trading the 1min charts to start. Follow the 5min charts live to see how the indicators work. I hope this is helpful.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Thanks so much. I am really happy to see your response and you guys are being wonderful in helping newbies on the thread like me. Thanks once again.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
No problem Ras. I still consider my self a newbie and am learning everyday. I keep experimenting with my system but the constant denominator is Dollie (which has to mean something). This trade I am posting now is a great example of following price action and using Support and Resistance to your advantage. I got into this trade and if I just followed Dollie I would have gotten out with a minimal loss but I trusted the Resistance levels and Price Action. The price had already broken this R1 level, came back down and then started to move upwards. I think it will hit the R2 level but I didn't want to push it and got out while I was ahead. It must be amazing to have a reliable system (I believe Dollie is that one) and have a great knowledge of chart patterns, candle patterns, fib levels ect.... The results would be mind blowing. Then add in fundamental's. This truly is a life learning experience.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
As you can see the R2 level was hit and the price has seemed to stall. How freakin cool is that.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I just woke up (7am Eastern US) and turned on my computer to see the chart below. I didn't get in this trade but as you can see, everything lined up perfectly. As I have become more confident in Dollie and with my few tweaks I am now focusing on other aspects of trading. I am now trying to learn as much about Daily Support and Resistance Levels as I can. There is no doubt that they influence price movement and can be extremely important. Like I mentioned yesterday, it must be amazing to almost predict (to some degree) where the price will go and stall and one essential tool for this are an understanding of support and resistance levels. This will be my last post regarding this topic on this thread. I'll be investigating on the appopriate threads and I want this thread to get off track. I just want to share my thoughts with those that have helped me with this great system. Attached is an Auto Pivot Indicator that automatically plots daily, weekly, monthly pivots and support and resistance levels.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
I want to post this link to a great article I just read at investopedia.com on Support and Resistance. If you are new to the subject I recommend you read this. http://www.investopedia.com/articles...5/FXpivots.asp I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Hey jcblcs79: Thanks for the posts on the topics surrounding trading. They are a help for all of us. What did you think of your new favorite, eur/cad today? Only 140 pips down with the CAD unemployment news. Glad you like it and maybe next time on NFP you can get up at 3:45am. It's only sleep.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
I am really fond of this pair. The only thing I don't like is that my spread at MB Trading for this pair is 4 - 5 pips and rivals the Gbp/Yen pair and I hate giving money to my broker. As for news trading, I'm not quite there yet. I tend to stay away from the market during these "RED FLAG EVENTS". Plus MB Trading tells you on their website that trading during the news is Risky and even sends out a message before these big news events warning you. Is that an excuse to take advantage of a person... I don't know. I never had a problem with them so I can't say that. It is amazing though seeing the correlation between these events and price action. In any event, at least I am starting to understand why certain pairs are going long or short. I do try to take advantage of these news events throughout the day especially if the forecast is as off as it was today. Once I get all of my technicals down then I will conquer the fundamentals.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
how do you overlay indicators . I don't know how to do it , can anyone help plz?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Look at posts #668 and #669 for your answer. Welcome to the thread.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Jcblcs79: You are smart with your thoughts about the news and this pair. You like to use the M1 so that is why I wanted to tell you. But another idea is the rebound since the news. I was focused on other pairs and since I have been up today, the eur/cad has retraced 70 pips. Something to look at.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Hey Pirate... it took me 4 hours but I did get my share of this volatile pair today.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I know I said I wouldn't post anymore about Pivots, Support &amp; Resistance on this thread but check out this 1min chart from the Eur/Cad from the last 4 hours. Again... I am just learning the concepts of these lines (are they just magical numbers that work or are Big Players in this Market so ingrained to use these numbers that their own actions are thus fulfilling their predictions - does that make sense?). I'm not ready yet to start trading based on these Pivots, Support &amp; Resistance but once you see this first hand it is very hard to dismiss.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
I feel like this thread has become a Personal blog the last few days (sorry if I am bothering people) but I think I just had an epiphany!!! I have been doing very well these last few months (I don't want it to seem like I'm bragging) and I couldn't really put my finger on why I have been more successful with my trading but I think I just nailed it on the head. In the beginning I was so consumed with indicators. I would never pay attention to actual price movement. I would stare at my indicator windows and wait for them to tell me to get into a trade. Now I see myself looking at Price Movement and only looking at the indicators for confirmation. I recall reading numerous threads in the Forex Discussion Forum explaining this but I didn't understand. I always had a problem trusting indicators that I didn't even know how they worked but didn't know any other way. For whatever reason I gravitated to Dollie and took to her system (I said it before and I'll say it again... this system saved my account) and I will continue to use this great system as my primary indicator confirming Price Action. I don't know if this will help anyone but I wanted to share this idea. Everyone's path to success is different.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
My two cents. In many ways they are a self fulfilling prediction, as everyone knows the numbers. It depends also on why is the pair moving and if it was news, is it big enough news to blast thru the S/R? Is it a retracement and people wanted to make a few pips on the bounce so they might as well get out there. I do watch them if I think it might break thru. If the price bounces off of it 3 times or more, then a reversal of the trend is very possible. If you had a good entry, and have made your pip goal when it hits S or R, then it's not bad to take the profit. Or close out half of your position. Take notes and track what you are learning and in a few months you will see what works for you. I have a best friend, who has been trading with me since the beginning of forex trading for us, and he just called and is out of the business. He blew up his account again for the fourth time and his wife said enough for now. And it kills him not to trade. His problem: not using stops and also not taking profit when he was up. He would tell me ( and he is a scalper) that he would be up 30-50 pips some times and then wouldn't close out the trade because "he might get more". I tried to teach him about using more indicators like pivot points but he wouldn't listen.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I decided to give Dollie a new fresh start after my initial success. And I've decided to go back to some of th initial rules. I've done some manual back testing over the weekend on the EUR$ and decided on the following rules: 1. On the first indicator window, the Blue line must cross the Orange line and should be on top (buy signal). 2. The Isma should enter the area between the blue en orange line as indicated with the arrow. 3. The white dotted line should also be in between the blue and orange line (not in this example) 4. On the second indicator window, ADX lines should be in line for long signal (blue above red) and Isma should enter the area between the lines from below as indicated by the arrow. The ADX index line should be above the 25 line. 5. Stay in the trade as long as Isma stays greeen of within area between blue and orangle line. Or when Isma enter overbought area. 6. I've decided to put my SL at 15pips and take half my profit after 12pips profit. Them move SL to BE. 7. Exit as indicated on Bullet 5. I am still working on the Guppy. This trade didn't really work out as planned and I decided to exit "too early" - it was my first trade after backtesting and I wasn't sure of myself. The chart is as I exit the trade. But then look at the second chart - the chart changes as it develops further. So don't ignore the chart after you decided to exit. There could be another trade in it. At a later stage I want to use a longer time frame.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Golfer... what are your settings for the LSMA. The LSMA seems to be set differently in each window.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Hi Jc My Isma setting on the first indicator window is 10 &amp; 1500 and on the second indicator window (ADX) is 5 &amp;1500. If I do remember correctly, I did receive the indicators from Dollie herself via Skype. I think she was very frustated with me because I've struggled a lot in begining - especially to understand het system. That was shy she sent me several files. I will try and enter adn exit the trades on the opening and close of the candles.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Just another example today on EY, I've tried to highlight the crosses of the lines triangles and vertical lines. Entry shoudl have been on the opening of candle above arrow as indicated and exit on close of candle as indicated. About 50pips profit. But at this stage I am only working on the EUR$ - this is just an example to show the crosses of the lines to setup the entry. I hope it make sense.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I like the use of the ADX. I have been using the ADX different ways with Dollie and have had good results with each. I have used ADX set to 7 as a pure indicator of strength (Level 40 had to be breached - based on Investopedia) and now as almost a trend confirmation. As I scalp I wait for the 5min, 15min &amp; 1hour ADX to all be Green or Red. I look forward to seeing your charts with the ADX and LSMA working together.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Just the last example on EY to show an short trade for about 15-25pips. I've tried to indicate all the crosses with horisontal lines and arrows. The most important area is the triangle where Isma is between the blue and orange lines. Lets see how it develops. I'll keep you posted. P.S look at the setup just before the short setup. Isma moved into the zone (blue above orange) and turned green. Looks like a valid setup but ADX and Isma indicator window didn't confirm the setup. Don't take the long setup.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Hi Jc Right, I'll keep it in mind and look at it. Tx. I want to make Dollie a longer time frame system because I already have a very reliable 5min system that I trained myself for 10 months now. And I am training myself on another 4h system. And I think that is enough for part time trader.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
See attached for details.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
2 possible trades today on EUR. Just watching the price action and the formation of the charts to get a feeling for the live charts as they develop.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Nice examples Golfer. I really like the fact that when both the ASH RSI and LSMA match up with the ADX and LSMA you seem to have a safe setup. keep them coming.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
here is another gbpusd trade. Its funny because only last week I mentioned that I haven't traded a USD pair in a while and then today I get two nice moves. Yesterday was a little slow for me so I added this pair and the EurUsd pair to keep an eye on. That is what I love about Forex. There is always a pair moving.

Hello all, I have been following this thread for a while and have been demo trading the original dollie method on the 1 hour time frame during the London session. I have to admit that I was initially inspired by Blanca's success. I am curious to know if you all ever have trouble with the Isma 3. Sometimes the Isma does not seem to show a signal until after the fact. And it changes position even after the bar is closed. Also, besides the Isma 3 thing, there are times I seem to be getting a perfect "Dollie" signal and then, poof, two minutes later it's completely reversed. And then, surprisingly, 3 minutes after that, the dollie signal reappears. For those of you that are doing longer time frames, do you just stay in once a position is entered until your total stop loss is hit? Or do you exit if the signal is reversing? Maybe I just need more time practicing the trades, but any advice would be welcome. It has been really great reading how you all trade this method in your own unique ways. Good trading to you all.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi Mhb Yes, don't worry - I think it's just normal for this kind of indicator to behave like that. That is why I wrote in my previous posts that I am now looking at the live charts to see how the trades setups are developing. That is also why I will wait for a candle to close (on the 15min chart) before I enter. The same principle applies for my exit.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Maybe I can answer a few questions. First I am jealous of your trading the london session as you will be rich in a few years. If you see my posts, I trade dollie's second version (post #296 and on) as I didn't understand the absolute indicator and use the triple hull. ISMA to me is like a moving average and tells me where in the charts the pair is moving. Don'w worry about it too much as it lags the others. The beauty of Dollie's system is using all the indicators together, and hoping that 3 of them together tell you to get in the trade. Read my posts for more information on the zeromacd and dynamic zone. Welcome aboard! Yes I am a pirate Two hundred years too late The cannons don’t thunder There’s nothing to plunder I’m an over 40 victim of fate Arriving too late Arriving too late by Jimmy Buffett So now I plunder pips

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Thanks for the encouragement! Overall, the indicator seems to be pretty solid. There are just a few kinks to watch for is all. I should just be patient and continue practicing. And Pip Pirate, I definitely agree with you about the London session advantage. For some reason, I don't trade the New York session well at all. I have always done better with the London. Those London trends are so nice. But guess what . . . My time zone is Rocky Mountain Standard time! I am a complete night owl anyway, so fortunately it works out. Anyway, good to hear from you guys.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Nice to see a lot of activity on this thread. jc79............great charts, mate, and it's good to see how you've adapted the dollie system to your own style of scalping etc. Interesting how you've incorporated the Laguerre indicator, and is that a Keltner channel you're using in the main window? You seem to be doing ok, mate. Keep it up. Golfer...........Hi Willem, and it's nice to see you active on this thread. Your use of the ADX is interesting, but I'd be grateful if you could break down exactly how you incorporate the lsma3 in there. What precisely are you looking for etc? Also, the lsma3 in the dollie window doesn't look to have the same setting as the one in the ADX window. Can you confirm that or otherwise? I haven't been posting lately, as I'm in the process of changing my whole set-up here. Plus, the Christmas period is always a busier time for me than normal domestically. I'm already looking forward to the New Year, so that things can get back on an even keel again! Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I look forward to seeing what you've come up with.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Sorry, mate, nothing new regarding my method. I was referring to my hardware.......lol. Finally bit the bullet and shelled out for something a little more up-to-date. Also changing my ISP, which can be a pain sometimes here in the UK. From what I read about other countries, we're still in the dark ages here, it seems. My new provider promises up to 8mB download speed, but I know for a fact that my local exchange (one and a quarter miles from me) only manages 4mB tops. Which means I'll probably end up with around 2mB, if I'm lucky. Oh yes, we're REALLY 21st century here in the UK! Cheers for now.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I am just starting to learn the fundamental aspects and in no way do I consider myself knowledgable in this area. I did just place a successful trade on the USD/CAD cross mostly because of the indicators and a little because of the news. Having an understanding of WHY the price was actually moving instead of just thinking its random was kind of cool.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
here is a great 150 move on the audjpy 5min chart. I didn't get in on this and even if I did I probably wouldn't have stayed in this long. That is the only downfall of working the 1min charts. You do get more moves in a day but usually none of these whoppers.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Quick post to probably our US friends and those who can trade the Asian session. It's 15:48GMT and the majors aren't doing anything lately, except at the open when I was asleep. But look at the AUD pairs, which have made moves against the AUD as the AUD unemployment rate is due later today. Sad that I didn't see it earlier to get in. EUR/AUD is up 50+ since I got up. Can see these types of interday moves before the news, so that you can take the profit right before the news event.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Here is awesome trade off the Eur/Cad. I stayed in this trade longer then usual and it paid off. All of my indicators were leading me to believe the Price had momentum all the way up to the Daily Resistance 1. see attached

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Here is a trade that I probably got into too late. Instead of convincing my self that I was right I followed the indicators and got out. Maybe it will turn in my favor, we'll find out. I would rather get out of a trade breaking even and see it go in my favor then stay in a trade and watch my SL get hit. There will always be more opportunities.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hi Eyevoltage Tx for the words. Yes, I'm back with a system where I had 12 positive trades in a row posted somewhere on this thread (I really didn't know why I ignore this system up to now). Hopefully I can do the same again. To answer your question: I am back with one of the old systems. Look at Dollie's posts on Page 2 - post #22 and Page 9 - post 129. Last weekend I did some back testing and I found how constantly you can make 10-50pips on the 15min EUR chart as explained on page 47 post #701. I started with the 30min chart but I didn't like it. The 15min gave better signals and the 5min gave too many false signals. Now I am working on Jc ADX indicator as well. I hope it make sense.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
i guess i'm too impatient LOL. Oh well

--- 帖子 #727 ---
My trade today on EUR. Unfortunately I had to leave the office for a meeting - so I close it for about 13pips profit. Chart 1: I entered way too late (opening of the second last candle) - I saw the setup too late. Correct entry should have been the opening of the fourth last candle around 1.4658: Reason - Isma entered the "safe zone" on both indicator windows with the opening of the that candle. One need to look at the charts every 15mins. Chart 2: That was how my chart looked at the close of my trade - should have waited for candle to close but I had to go to a meeting. Chart 3: Just to show one of our members who was worried about the changes of the charts as time goes on. Also I indicated with the arrows all the crosses needed for a signal as well as the safe zones in the rectangle. Also the enter (opening of candle) and exit (close of candle). Look at the ellipse in the rectangle - that was where my exit was. If I had waited for candle to close, Isma would have been still within the safe zone. Last comment on chart 3: Isma has just entered the safe zone on the first indicator window but the ADX window's Isma is not yet in line. No entry. JC's ADX indicator also shows only 2 are in line. Eyevoltage: Just a very interesting approach to the Dollie system I am trying out. It is now 2 out of 2 trades positive with lost of possible trades missed. Currently I am just following the EUR to test this system. Any comments are more than welcome.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Hi Eyev Sorry - I forgot about your ADX question. Jc also asked that question. My answer is on page 47.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Hi Jc Yes, you can't win them all but....... Luckily we know why.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi Jc Great advice - it is also my approach lately. I also realised lately that I should exit with small loss (if I see the trade is not going my way) rather than waiting for a small profit. Learned it the hard way this week - smetimes they don't return to BE. New strategy for me as from now on.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
I couldn't agree more Golfer. I set an absolute final SL at 15. I rarely get to that point though. I would rather have 4 - 5 losing trades at -5 pips then 2 - 3 loses at -15 pips. I think it also helps me physcologically as well. I now trade 100,000 lots and I can't stand to see over $100 in RED. It is a lot easier for me to see a $40 - $50 dollar loss. It is also easier to overcome.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
I am following your work with interest Golfer. Thanks for your posts. I will continue to trade the 1 hour charts, but I see that the EUR does provide reliable signals on the 15 minute chart as well. Many of the other pairs seem too give too many false signals on the 15 minute chart using the pure original dollie, but the EUR is great. Thank you for your great observation. Good luck to you!

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Hello, Willem. Looking at my chart, you'll notice I don't as yet use the ADX, preferring instead to stick with the Dynamic RSI, as I think it's one of the best damn indicators I've ever seen. So...... Referring to said DZ zone, the first yellow vertical line pinpoints where the trade was first indicated. Looking into the Dollie window, it's also within one period of what I would term a strong "Dollie" signal. (RSI2/CCI6 crossing up through the zero line.) However, even though Dollie is saying "go", it would be pure speculation as to whether or not the price would rise, as the Guppy ma's are still in "short trade" positioning, even though the ST's are getting very compressed. I've said before that I don't like trading TOWARDS the 60ema, as it would be usually against the current trend. I'll only take a trade if the price has left the 60ema behind and is moving AWAY from it. Eventually, we see price move up towards the Pivot Point (another major obstruction to the trade), so I would have waited for the line to be breached, even though, at this point, the Guppy ST's have crossed and are nicely spreading apart. My theoretical entry point, indicated by the arrow at the 2nd vertical line, would, for me, have been the perfect place to get in. Right on the Pivot Point with plenty of "moving up" space, ST's looking strong, lsma3 having just crossed the zero line, and the green line in the DZ continuing to look very positive. My 2nd yellow arrow at the 3rd yellow vertical line indicates the exit point, but it's fair to say that the exit would have probably been on the close of the preceding candle. However, the upside down hammer under the arrow would have been telling me very loudly to jump ship.....PRONTO!! At that point, of course, the RSI2 and the lsma3 are both in OB territory, with the lsma3 starting to sneak out of the orange/blue zone. So, by waiting for the entry point I described, it turned a speculative trade into a solid well-indicated one. Dollie and Guppy strike again!!

Great Post Eye. Awesome explanation. I just looked over my charts and the Aud/Jpy jumped out at me. As you can see the price fell 80 pips in 1min. As far as I can see there wasn't a major news release at this time. As a scalper seeing something like this scares the crap out of me especially when everything would be telling you to go long. Has anyone seen anything like this before (I haven't in the last year as far as I can remember). What would cause this?

Jcblcs79: Hey my friend you must have a bad feed from your broker. I admit that I am looking back after a few hours as I was away, but I can't find anything like it on my Interbankfx platform. Maybe it's a sign to stay away from the M1. LOL. That's a crazy 1 min chart. Too fast for me. Always set S/L's. There was AUD unemployment today so the AUD pairs had plenty of action. Watch all the AUD pairs from the US session on for some pips. I would call the broker and find out if that really happened and tell them no one else had it. The next two candles don't look right either.

Pirate, I trade through MB Trading and they don't offer charts. I have been switching from AlecchoFX and StrategybuilderFX for their Metatrader Charts. Unfortunately I wasn't around my computer when this happened so I don't know if MB fell as well. Check out the chart below... both the Eur and Aus Yen pairs got crazy at 23:50 except the Eur spike upwards while the Aus went down. If anyone has any correlating data please post. Thanks

(On my chart, the spike would have shown at 1630) What a strange fluke. That would be enough movement on a one minute chart to give me a heart attack!

Hi Mh Thanks for your message and good luck to you too. Looking forward to see your charts posted in the thread.

Hi EyeV Thanks for your comments - I do appreciate it. Just one comment: I just don't understand the dynamic RSI. To me it seems like the indicator is just zig-zag all over the place. Maybe it is just a case of "not understanding the indicator". Take for example your chart: just before your vertical line 1: the green line was moving all (zig-zag) over the blue line. What made you decide that now the indicator has started moving in a direction? Sorry but I don't see it. Or am I missing the point/function of the indicator? Maybe you can assist me (to understand) with this indicator. Also, it took me a while to understand the initial Dollie system. I like to keep things as simple as possible. The Dollie system was complicated enough for me.

Golfer: Dynamic zone is the best! It's easy: Just green over blue line with separation going long, and the reverse going short. that's it.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi PP2 Thanks for trying to help me. That I do understand (there needs to be a separation) - but what do you see as "separation" (between the blue and the green line)? Where eyevoltage draw his vertical line 1 - I don't see separation between their blue and green line. The only separation I can see each between the vertical line 1 and 2. And then again just after vertical 3. That is why I've tried to link this indicator with all the other signs/signals but I just couldn't get the picture. That is why I deleted it from my charts. Sorry to bother you but I am really frustrated. I want to see this indicator working but it is just not there. I'm sure it will take some time - hopefully I will be getting there soon.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi Golfer, I would love to try the second dollie indicator that you are using (the ADX 13 one), but have been having trouble overlaying the indicators correctly. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. Would it be possible to get your template? I want to see how it filters some of the trades if it would not be too much of a bother for you to attach it. Have a great day (night?)!

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi Mh No problem - yes it is still morning in South Africa (GMT plus two hours). I had the very same problem. In the past I've struggled with the MT4 platform. Now it's getting better. I'll post it later today - I cannot normally access my platform during the day(working time) because of our firewall. I do use special software. You just need to have all the indicators are already on your platform.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Hi Willem. I can understand your confusion, and I think maybe it's because of my description. Pip pirate2 is right when he says "green crosses blue" etc, but I think there's a little more to it than that. Basically, the whole thing revolves around a Bollinger Band with the middle band being the red dotted line. The green line is an RSI and the blue line is an MA, and they're both interacting with each other all the time within the BB. The important thing I think I should point out with regard to my chart and analysis is that I didn't decide that the indicator had started moving in a particular direction where I drew my first yellow vertical line. Yes, you're right when you point out that the green line was zig-zagging back and forth over the blue line before my 1st yellow vertical. However, all that action was happening in a typical Bollinger Band "squeeze", where price action is usually pretty stable at that time. I kept an eye on each zig-zag to see if there would be any sign of a break-out. Four periods after my vertical line, the first signs of a break-out occured with the green RSI line breaching the upper band, whilst at the same time, the lsma3 was crossing into the orange/blue zone. As the green RSI line continued to show strength outside the BB, it was then just a case of watching and waiting for a suitable entry point which occured as described in my original post. So, again, the 1st vertical line didn't signal anything other than an INDICATION of a POSSIBILITY of something happening, that's all. In this case, something did, but obviously, it doesn't always end up that way! Hope that clears things up for you, mate. Cheers

For those who scalp I really recommend using the MTF ADX indicator. It has stopped me from chasing every move and has cut down on my losing trades.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Here is a quick 10 pip trade on the 1min charts. Everything lined up for me except I wasn't getting confirmation from the 1hour ADX. I did a quick switch to the actual 1hour chart and saw that it was the 2nd candle going long and Dollie itself was giving a long signal at the 1hour timeframe. Because of this I decided to get in the trade but because the ADX 1hour was still going against me I decided that I would aim for 10 pips and get out and I lucked out. I got my 10 pips and once I saw 2nd short candle I jumped ship. The following three charts are the 1min setup, the 1hour look &amp; then the 1min after I got out. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you really need to get a good feel for your system that you trade. Doing that will allow you to make better analytical decisions. Newbies - My advice would be just watch Dollie's original window for a month live and see how those indicators work. Once you get her down you can move on and add a few more indicators that you like. There are some great combinations on this thread (Eyevoltage, PipPirate, Dollie's 2nd, Golfer ect...). Don't get discouraged. You will lose money. It is inevitable because once you trade live your emotions will take over. Start with mini lots or 10,000 and as you gain experience you can add lots. Don't do what I did. I started trading live after a month of researching using 100,000 lots with a $3,000 account and I was down to $800 bucks in a month. I stopped trading for 3 months and just watched the charts whenever I had free time concentrating on Dollie. Once I felt confident I started trading 10,000 lots and started to build my account back up. I now flirt with the idea of trading 200,000 lots ($20 a pip for US pairs - WOW!!!) but I am afraid. The wins would be great but I don't think I could emotionally handle the losses.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
This is a good example of DZ action before a price move. I didn't take this, as I wasn't at the computer at the time, but I thought it would be helpful in relation to my last post. Look in the blue rectangle. The bollinger band is in a squeeze, indicating that price is pretty stable and isn't moving much. Inside, the green RSI and the blue MA are interacting all the time, but a glance at the price action above, and a look at what's happening in the dollie window, soon lets you know that there's nothing on yet. Then, the green line crosses below the blue (1st yellow vertical) and you'd think: "Ah, this could be a short trade." However, look at the dollie window and you'll see that there's hardly any reaction from the ASH, which you would expect to start making a strong movement upwards, which it isn't. Yes, there's movement from it, but nothing substantial. Then, there's a very strong movement from the green RSI upwards (just before the 2nd yellow vertical), accompanied by the RSI2/CCI6 combination crossing the zero line in the dollie window. Additionally, the bollinger band is widening very nicely. The 3rd yellow vertical shows a good entry point for going long, as the lsma3 enters the orange/blue zone. From then on, it's a matter of following Guppy's ST's, which are nicely separating, with an exit anywhere you like between the two yellow arrows. However, the orange/blue zone in dollie's window gives you every incentive to let it run right to the 2nd arrow, as that's where the lsma3 leaves the zone and enters OB territory. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Great explanation Eye. I don't want to seem like I'm beating a dead horse but I think you reiterated my point. You need to know your system before you trade it. I think too many people trade a system and don't even understand it, I did the same thing when I started.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hi Eyev Excellent job explaining it. You should have been in my job - a lecturer. I am studying right now and will look for other similair setups. I'll let you know how I'm doing. Slowly starting to make sense. Tx Eyev &amp; PP2 for the support.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Hi Jc Totally agree with you - I've seen that with that 5min system I am trading - people don't understand the principles but they want to use it to make quick bucks. Doesn't work like that. I'll only trade the system which I understand - that is why I went back to the original Dollie system. And that is why I deleted some of the indicator windows I don't understand. It was just confusing. Now I try to keep it as simple as possible. And then add some more once I am familiar with it. Just like I've done with the 5min system I am studying.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Hi Mh The attachment as promised. It may change in future after EyeV's lecture. I hope it helps/works.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Mate, you hit the nail on the head. I've never seen the point of trying to trade a system without at least making some effort to understand it first. The problem with this forum (and other forex forums) is that people come up with some great systems (like Dollie did), and then find themselves overloaded with all sorts of basic questions. Questions which could be answered by taking a little time to study and learn. In this game, we have the best resources of all to learn from, and they are the charts we use. The answer to any question is in there, if one bothers to study them in detail. What irritates me is when I look in the Forex Beginner's threads, and see questions like: "Anyone out there got a really simple scalping system I can use? I'm just a newbie and can't be bothered studying all that Technical Analysis stuff. Just show me a system, tell me how to use it, and that'll do." And what about : "This system looks pretty cool. I can't be bothered reading the whole thread 'cos it's too long, so can anyone just give me a quick run-down on how to use it?" Sometimes, words fail me..... No, really, they do! Jc, by the way, great charts, mate, and you've really managed to nail scalping this system with your method. Well done! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
No problem, Willem. It's nice to return the favour. You've shown enough patience with me regarding Phil's 5min Intraday system! Best of luck. Cheers

--- 帖子 #755 ---
The attached chart shows the price between the 200 &amp; 60 EMA. For those following my setups, this is an area that I wouldn't trade. I usually stay away from trades when the 2 EMAs converge or wait for the price to clearly breakthrough either EMA. They sometimes form a solid support or resistance other times they don't. I play it safe and don't take any of the reads.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Thanks for the template golfer!

--- 帖子 #757 ---
I can't see much to fault this example. The 1st yellow vertical indicates a point where the DZ green line has just crossed the blue. At the same time, the CCI6 has just followed the RSI2 and crossed the zero line in the Dollie window. Price itself is coming off the Pivot line, which in itself is a very good sign, so now all we want is for the ASH to make some sort of significant move upwards. The 2nd yellow vertical indicates ASH crossing the zero just as Guppy is showing encouraging signs. Also, in the DZ we see the green/blue combination continuing to show strength, nicely spaced apart and heading downwards. At this point, the lsma3 hasn't entered the orange/blue zone, but it's the right colour and heading in the right direction. The CCI6, however, IS in the zone, so all in all, this is a good entry point, as the 1st yellow arrow indicates. After entry, there's a temporary stall of price on the M2 line, which seems to happen a lot in this situation. However, by this time, Guppy is looking REALLY good, with the ST's separating from the LT's, and the ST's themselves separating nicely. I like the look of the Bear candles, as they have practically NO Bull activity indicated at all i.e. VERY short shadows. S1 proves to be a worthwhile target, and it's here we jump ship, as ASH peaks in the OB zone, and conversely, RSI2 and lsma3 drop into the OS zone. A nice-looking trade where everything seemed to fall into place nicely.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Recently I've decided to save my charts as they developed because of the changes. Just look at my first chart - Unfortunately I didn't catch this one - and see the setup as you will see it. I've highlighted the safe zones with 2 ellipse and 2 vertical lines. As well as the entry (opening of candle) and exit (opening of candle) of the trade for about 30pips. Can you see that on EyeVoltage's chart's the Isma would have been in the save zone? Now look at the second chart - see how the situation has changed. Just look alomost like EyeVoltage's chart. That is reason why backtesting this system is so difficult. I am rather going tot test my system live. It is very important to save ones chart when opening the trade to see how it was at the begining of the trade. The same with the exit.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Attached is a trade I just got out of. If I was more patient I could have got 30 more pips. Oh well, hindsight is always 20/20.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I know I didn't, but I sure wish I had! Only must managed to sit down for any length of time after being busy doing other things, and decided to just browse through the different pairs and this one literally smacked me in the eye!! What a beauty! The first heads-up in the DZ zone comes at a time when the BB is in a squeeze and therefore not looking promising. However, experience tells me that with this method, it's always worth keeping an eye on what at first glance doesn't look very good. On the first vertical line, we see the DZ green/blue cross over, whilst in the Dollie window, the RSI2/CCI6 has moved/is moving across the zero line. The ASH is looking promising with its downward movement, so we're waiting for a positive movement from lsma3 and a suitable entry point just above the Pivot Point. As you can see, the first yellow arrow indicates the eventual entry point at the spinning-top just above the PP. Maybe a spinning-top isn't ideal, but Guppy is starting to look very positive, so in we go. And what a lovely ride up this would have been! Only a momentary pause at the doji (marked by the yellow cross) to catch our breath, then it's all systems go to R1 and a quick exit (2nd yellow arrow), as the lsma3 enters OB territory to keep the RSI2 company! I make that a potential profit of 107 pips after spread, and I sure hope SOMEONE out there got it!

Forex Friends: I just got back from my holiday for the holidays. Went to see friends and family and now I'm back to post and get back to trading. Didn't think about trading much at all which is good for me so I could have some time off. Golfer it looks like you have your answers. Great to see all the activity.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Good to have you back Pip. I am going to the bahamas next week and can't wait to escape the cold. I live in NE USA and am tired of these blizzard conditions. I can't wait to be in warm weather even if it is only for 4 days. Anyway... here is a perfect scalp I just got out of. I am really growing fond of the Laguerre and MTF ADX. There is another thread (Imran's 5min Scalp) that focuses on the Lags. He uses them as actual entry and exit. I prefer to use them to tell me the general direction of the move and use Dollie as my entry and exit. If I never mentioned, I have my Laguerre set to .60 &amp; the min set to -.05 &amp; max 1.05. I am very confident when the Laguerre is running flat at either extreme. As for the MTF ADX, I really am not taking a trade unless I have confirmation from the 5, 15min &amp; 1hr. There have been a few counter trend moves I have taken successfully but don't recommend that until you are comfortable trading with the trend.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
here is an example of a counter trend trade. I didn't take this but it did jump out at me. Look how Daily Pivots, Supports and Resistance all come to play if you were to consider this. No I won't go long unless the price is above the 60 EMA or short unless the price is below the 60 EMA. As I have been using the 200 and 60 EMA I hesistate to go against the 200 EMA but have noticed that when there is a good separation between the 2 you can take advantage of a quick scalp using the 200 EMA as support/resistance. Add a knowledge of Pivots, Support/Resistance and a complete trust of your indicators and you can really be successful at counter trend moves. I'm not there yet but it does seem promising.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
attached is another CT move. I still am not comfortable taking these but I do see a move between the EMAs a few times a day that taken alone could be quite profitable. On the chart you'll see the ADXs wouldn't be in my favor and the price was below the 60 EMA but above the 200 EMA. Dollie and Lags were in my favor and you'll see how the price finds support at the 200 EMA and seems to be a great TP setting.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hi PP2 yes, thanks. Working hard on it. I am so glad you did enjoy your holiday - I hope you will do the same now with trading.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
attached are two quick scalps taking advantage of the relationship between the 60 and 200 EMA. I am not taking these trades just yet (I still only go with the surest setup - Dolli, Lag. &amp; ADXs in my favor) but like said yesterday, I see this move a few times a day and those alone could be quite profitable once you get used to this price action. You'll see in the charts that these trades do have Dollie in their favor as well as the Lag but don't have all the ADXs and are below the 200EMA and both EMAs are sloping downwards.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Hi Golfer, Why is it that for the LSMA you use the vale 10 for Rperiod instead of 5?

--- 帖子 #768 ---
I have had a request for my particular template so I am going to list my indicators and their settings (I can't program). Unfortunately I do not have set entry or exit rules. I go be feel. Newcomers, Please do not throw this on a chart and start trading today. Watch the indicators and get a feel for them. You might want to make some changes to fit your style. Finally, I have taken components from Imran's 5min Scalping System (the 60 &amp; 200 EMAs &amp; Lag). Please read his thread and PDF to get a feel for those indicators. You will see that I don't use the Lags the same way. I use Original Dollie as my primary entry and exit. The only difference is I set my LSMA to 10. I feel it gives a better flow. Please refer to the beginning of the thread for those indicators. In the price screen I use the 200 (aqua) &amp; 60 (magenta) EMA. I also have the Auto Pivot Indicator which gives me Support and Resistance lines. I also have the Fast Guppy MAs plotted. I am always adding things to this window (Slow Guppy, Kelter Channels, TD Lines, Slope Directional Movement) but have stuck with the EMAs &amp; Pivot. Again, please read Imran's thread. He explains the 60 &amp; 200 EMA very well and how to use them. I use the Laguerre. I set the gamma to .60 with a fixed min at -.05 &amp; 1.05 with leves at .75 &amp; .25. I use this differently from Imran. He uses Lags as entry and exit. I use it more as a confirmation tool and really prefer entering a trade when the Lag is at either extreme running flat. Finally, I use the MTF ADX. I keep that set to default and wait until I have confirmation from the 5min 15min &amp; 1hour. See the attached chart. This will be a perfect setup. I scalp the 1min charts because it fits my personality. I hope this helps.

Hi Jc That will done fine, thanks for all your trouble. I really do appreciate it.

I have been scalping this pair all morning for a total of 40 pips and thought I was doing well (see first chart for a move I got). Anyway, I got curious of why this pair was moving so much and sure at 4:30am Eastern Time there was a RED FLAG news event that supports this move. I do not pay attention to news releases as much as I should and honestly don't know what most of these are (as in today's case) but it is clear that fundamental anaylsis has a huge impact on price action. The second chart I posted is the 1hour GBP/USD from 4am to present. You can clearly see how the news release affects price but how Dollie also supports this move. I am not patient enough to trade the 1hour charts but clearly 1 or 2 moves like this a week would make it all worth it (less stress and less commission I pay to MT Trading).

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Hi Jake, The news event this morning was that The BOE voted 9-0 for the last rate cut. Quite often this vote can be 5-4, 6-3, 7-2 etc. As it was 9-0 this indicates that there is a high probability that rates will be cut again in the near future. You can find a calender of main news rvents here on ForexFactory: http://www.forexfactory.com/calendar.php Hope this helps Derm

Hi Gs I really cannot remember. I think I received the indicators from Dollie and just saved them. I didn't really played around with the settings. I was just following Dollie's advice. This is how I use them currently and it is working. Sorry that I cannot answer your question.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Jake Just a word of caution from personal experience. I wanted to learn as much as possible when I first started trading the Forex market. I soon realised that economic data had a major influenece on the markets and would try and take in as much information as possible as all currencies are inextricably linked. Even though I mainly trade EUR/JPY &amp; GBP/USD I soon found myself trying to absorb data from so many countries that I just got totally bogged down. Spent more time reading and reserching and bugger all time trading. There are just so many news announcements to concentrate on that have an effect on the market. Now, each Sunday evening I print of an 'Econonmic Data Sheet' for the week. It's on my wall in my office and each morning I make a note of the times of releases which are considered important. I won't enter a trade a good hour before 'important' news. On the rare occasions I happen to be in a trade I make sure I have a stop in place. Hope this helps Derm

--- 帖子 #777 ---
My first try with Jakes' scalping system. I did enter too late (first price tag) and I should have entered 10pips earlier when Isma entered the safe zone. The price move down 14 pips (10pips nett)(second price tag). At that point I would have taken half my profit but I couldn't follow the trade live. My Swiss Army EA moved my stoploss to break even after eight pips in profit. My stoploss was then triggered at break even (third price tag). Hopefully not too bad for a first try.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Looks good Golfer. I would have entered that trade as well if I was awake. Everything looked good, EMAs were separated, Dollie looked good, ADXs were in your favor as was the Laguerre. It is a shame you couldn't have traded this live and secured some of those pips. When I trade, especially early in my day I take those 10 pips and run. The only time I ever stay in a trade is if I switch to the 5min chart and see how that looks, then I make the decision to stay in or get out. Anyway... I just got up and am pissed off that I didn't get up at 4am like I had planned especially with the USD pairs all moving so much. I hope it continues the rest of the morning.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Hi J Tx. But luckily I don't mind wasting a few pips at this stage. Just trying to get the feel for this system and try to match it with my 5min (Phillip), 15min (Dollie) and 4h (Phillip) systems. Looking very encouraging. The rest of the day was very choppy on my 3 pairs (EUR, cable and EY) - difficult to get a nice entry. A few high risk trades could haven given you 10pips. I think we in South Africa is very luckily when it comes to the trading session - nice to catch the London and US sessions. I don't mind missing the Aus and Asian sessions - I haven't really seen nice big movements there. But I could be wrong. Enjoy the trading.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Well I hope my variation gets you many green pips and although I am very happy with this system I'm sure I'll be posting charts in the near future with something new on them (and something taken off) but Dollie will surely be there. I read through countless posts (on different threads) a day and I always find people asking for a sure entry point. That is what is so great about Dollie's orginal setup. Once you decide what way the price is going, Dollie is so clear about entry (and exit).

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hi jcblcs79, What does the sign on TF 5min and 15min mean. Also what does the color indicate. Do you have ADX MTF.mq4 file that can be edited.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Silver, I didn't come up with this indicator so I can't completely answer your question but here is my interpretation as I assume (and we all know what happens when you assume). Green - Long Red - Short. The higher the actual number the stronger the play. Anything over 30 is a strong move in my mind. I don't really pay too much attention to the numbers for my style of trading, I only care about the color. To get a better understanding of this indicator open up the regular ADX (set to 13) and take notice of that indicator window in a particular time frame and the MTF ADX reading. You should see the correlation. I have traded using ADX before so I understand it a little. It doesn't read like an EMA. See the chart below for a better explanation - they say a picture is worth a 1000 words or something like that. Please don't trade this alone, use it as a tool. FYI - ADX does lag more then most indicators. For more info on ADX go to Ivestopedia.com. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
would you take a long trade if all signs lead to long except laguerre was at .25 and angleing upward?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I don't but that is my style. I want the Lag to be at either extreme (running flat to me is the best). I have passed on some successful trading opportunities because of this but it has also kept me out of some losing trades. I don't use the Lag as an entry or exit. I use it for a general price direction. (I could be using this completely wrong as Imran uses the Lag in the way you describe). Again - this is my style and is by no means almighty. I still have losing trades everyday (yesterday was particularly tough because I tried to make something out of nothing during the US afternoon).

--- 帖子 #785 ---
what times US do you seem to have the most sucess? Also, what pairs do u trade?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
I try to get up for 4am to get in on the European Market (everyday I see great moves that I miss) but find my self up around 6am and trading until 12pm. Sometimes you will see nice moves after that but it is too inconsistent. I keep an eye on all charts and will ride a few until they go flat. My main charts are the US Eur, Pound, CAD AUS pairs and Eur and Aus Yen pairs. The Eur/Cad is also very good but I don't get a great spread on that from MB Trading. Same goes with the GBP/Yen.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Where or from whom did u get this indicator?

I don't recall - it might have been from Imran's thread. I read his thread everyday. Sorry.

One of the things that Dollie taught me was to pay attention to the H1 and H4 charts. I have been but I too get caught up in the smaller charts and miss moves like this one. It's only 200 pips in one day. I have been listening to some trader interviews on line ( www.traderinterviews.com ) and one guy gave me hope. He said that he had been trading stocks for years and it took him 2 years to learn to trade currencies. It just takes time.

I agree Pip. The longer TF's is where the riches lie. I have been working on a Daily System that incorporates Dollie. My plan is to set up a different account and start trading it live with mini lots after the new year. I am going to open that account look at the Daily charts once a day &amp; make my decision, set my SL and TP and then forget about it (even though that goes against my personality to the T). I was thinking about doing this between 8 &amp; 9pm each night. What do you think about this time.

[quote=jcblcs79;1770306]I agree Pip. The longer TF's is where the riches lie. I have been working on a Daily System that incorporates Dollie. I thought that more frequent trading was more profitable in the long run? A) only trades once a day and the second system (B) trades 10 times a day, there is going to be a big difference in the level of profitability. regards Red

I like your ideas J but as you know to play the daily chart you will have to have a big S/L to start. The times are good.I want you to pay attention to the HMA color moving average indicator tho as it is very important. I would go back through the past 6 months or so with the daily chart to study how you would make your move. What you are going to see is that usually, when the HMA color changes color (and that means direction), then the move is going to happen. But the HMA can give false signals and they are usually because it is the wrong time of day. So if the HMA changes during one of the dead times, then don't trade it. Sometimes it doesn't happen right away. But see if you notice what I have been studying lately: If you wait until the HMA color changes, then the high price of the day right before the directional change seems, in most cases, to be the highest price that you can use as a stop loss marker. So I would set a stop loss 20 pips or so above that high price (unless it is the gbp/jpy or something like it), and I have seen that you won't get stopped out. Now your entry price might be 50 pips or so below that price (on a short move for example), but test it for yourself. Then depending on the pair, be slow to move your s/l up until you have a good move. I have seen it come back up and almost hit that price before it makes its final move. We don't talk enough about the HMA color but that indicator is becoming more and more my friend. The other thing you might want to do is trade the H4 as you will have more trades and that make fit your style. I have been testing the H4 a lot and am now ready to trade it big time. That is my style: to think too much and practice, test, and watch the moves until I am sure this is going to work. After a while you can see that the H4 is dying to make a move so you have to stalk it. Good news is that you don't have to be in it right when it makes its first candle. Just wait for the right move after that and you still can get pips (that goes for the daily too). Just wait for the HMA color to change and make sure with the candles that it is moving now as sometimes it will go sideways for a day.

Hi, Wondered if anyone caught this move short on the daily charts over the holiday period? I got in late but managed to get 125 pips... Thanks to Dollie, PP2, Blanca and everyone who has contributed so far - I am still reading through the thread and haven’t caught up yet but I wanted to keep the thread alive and show my interest...I will post more when I'm fully read up. I wondered how people are managing stops on the daily charts? Also I am London based and relatively new to Forex and have a 9-6 job but wondered if anyone had any advice as to what would I could look at early morning or evening GMT? Is anyone using a Spread betting Company as there broker? Happy and prosperous new year to all. regards Red

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Welcome Red: Glad that you are willing to do the homework first which is a good sign of your future success. I am working on trading the larger time frames but am not ready for a daily chart, as I do this full time. To trade the dailys, you are going to have to set a big stop if you get in early. There is a lot of potential for you with this style of trading if you realize that there will only be a few good trades a month with this method. But when they hit they will be for over 100 pips. I personally would love to see how you do with this method and your posting as you can be a big help to the board. You can inspire the part timers that it can be done. What I have noticed is that if you start watching the market, say at 7GMT until work, you may be able to see that many times, the Asian session will give you a hint on which way it wants to take the pairs. Several times a month you will see that there is some movement in the late Asian session that will continue into the London session. Realize, since you are new, that there are going to be times when you are wrong and your losses will be big. I would paper trade and then go to a mini account for at least a year. The big money will always come, but money management is the key to successful trading. I have given many ideas in this thread. If you go too fast, blow up your account, the damage that it will do to your mind will take months to change. I have never blown up my account but have taken some big losses and it screwed up my thinking. Go slow, read, study, have a journal and you can succeed.

Happy New Year everyone!!! I just got back from a long needed vacation and was very suprised by the volatility of Monday and Today (Wednesday). I hope this is a sign for the year to come. I'm going start trading Monday and will be posting charts. Hope everyone had a great holiday season.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Greetings all my friends on FF and a Happy New Year! I am always learning new things and trying very hard to be open to ideas, not be ridged in my thinking and trust what I see. I know it was the holidays so I was looking at the market but wasn't confident with many trades because of volume. Once again I was wrong. It seems that this market is growing so fast that there may not be any real down time. Here is a beautiful trade that I should have taken. Only 1000 pips. The arrows are showing you where the indicators are telling me to get in.

I am not a CPA nor am I giving tax advice. But I am going to recommend that those in the US explore having a forex CPA do your taxes if you made profits. Your regular CPA doesn't understand how forex works and the special rules and laws that allow you to pay less in taxes than a standard Schedule C form. There is a BIG difference between a trader and an investor when it comes to taxes. You may think you are a trader but you have to prove it. That is why I have a daily journal, where I write down the prices of 13 pairs. You have to be trading at least 4 hours a day to be a trader. How do you prove it without a journal with prices and times? The tax advantages of being a partnership instead of an individual are also worth it. Look at the web site www.simscpa.com and really read it. You will see that if you have a business, you can pay less in taxes with the 60/40 rule. Then someday, if you get the power of forex, we can talk about trading inside of a Roth IRA.

Hi PP, I don't have the arrow in the file on Dollie2 I copied the last time. How do you get the arrow in your system? If you don't mind, can I have it in mine as well? Still confuse with Dollie2 even with your detailed explanation. The arrow might just works the wonder. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Sorry joyrider for the confusion. The arrow is something that I added to the chart afterward as it is not an indicator. You can go to the top of the MT4 platform, under insert, and then you can find the arrows up or down to add to the chart. With Dollie2 there is no arrow indicator. What I always try to show on my charts is what the indicator looked like when the move started to happen. Since the indicators look different and act different, people need to see how they develop over and over. So you can go back over this thread and review all the charts that show the moves. Be patient with the system. We were all overwelmed with all the indicators at first and most give up before they understand them. Once you get it you can see the results from the posts on the board. Don't quit. When I started, I would take snapshots of tons of charts after the fact, so I could study on the weekend just what they looked like when the moves happened so I could learn how to understand the indicators. I would see things that even Dollie or Blanca didn't see at first. I have given all the answers I have learned on this post.

Hi PP, Can I have your MACD indicator if it's not so much of a problem? I've downloaded the MACD zerolag &amp; MACD H4 from the clip above but it's unlike the MACD shown on your chart. Thanks. Edit: Nevermind, I got it bu using the 3a template. Thanks. Edit 2: On the 3 color LSMA line, what is your setting? The minute I attach the 3 color lsma line it's the pink line in the template. Appreciate your help in this. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Here's what I have for the LSMA. The input is Rperiod 5 and the Draw4HowLongg 1500. the colors are all deep pink and the width is 2 Hope that helps. It seems that the LSMA line looks different on some people's platforms with different brokers. That is all we can figure out.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Been reading your instruction over and over and watching the movement of all the windows where the indicators are. Still not confident in placing a trade yet based on Dollie2. What I'd like most to do is to trade for a longer term basis, like 4H or daily as I do not need to check the price every now and then. Will wait for the best setup like you mention and have to try the backtest as you taught in your instruction over this weekend. Just for information, if we enter using the 4H timeframe, how long can we keep the position open? Thanks a lot, PP.You're very helpful to newby.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Joyrider: I believe that if you stick with your current plan of the longer time frame trades, paper trade for months, read some books on candles, you will be highly successful. When I got started, 3 years ago next month, I didn't listen to the long term trend guys because I thought I could scalp. Bad move. The one challenge you are going to have is because there are fewer moves a month using the longer time frames, it can take you longer to learn how to trade. Do not let this discourage you in any way. Back testing will help speed it up as you need to look at as many charts as you can. Now for the magic question: How long to keep a position open? Sorry I can't answer that as that is up to you. I would get a good book on candles, like from authors Morris or Nison. They are not cheap but worth it. Just look for example at the gbp/jpy since Dec 27. Now you as a new person should NOT trade this pair as it is dangerous for newbies. But look at the move. We all would have a tough time staying in that trade for the full 1000 pips. What you will develop over time is a feel for what is right for you and what your profit target should be. You can always get back in. Money Management is the most important part of trading. You are going to have to have large stop losses to trade the big times. Time is on your side. The money will come later but be a good trader first.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Come on people. Don't let this thread die again. The trends have been sideways for a week so there hasn't been any good longer term trades. But you U.K.ers should be making tons of pips with the Brit news.

In response to pip pirate's "voice in the wilderness", here I go again. I've been popping into and out of this thread over the last few weeks, just to see what's happening, and like pirate, I was getting a bit worried that the thread was dying. It seemed to be pretty healthy just before Christmas, but it's obvious we need some sort of stimulus to get it going again. To start things off in the right vein, here's one of my attempts this morning. What this one proves is that if people are prepared to wait patiently for the right signals, then pips are waiting to be collected. Sometimes, with this system, it's like money for old rope, quite honestly. Not all the time, mind you, but SOME of the time. This USD/CHF chart shows the DZ green line crossing the blue line, giving the "heads-up" that we all know and love. At that point, everything's looking good, apart from the ASH, which we want to cross the zero line. An hour later, over it goes, just slightly before the lsma3 crosses, and I'm in at the precise spot I wanted to be in.....slightly below the Pivot Line. It's all systems go from there on in, with the Guppy looking VERY healthy, and the exit point is clearly marked, as the lsma3 leaves the orange/blue zone. A pretty straightforward trade, which this Dollie/Guppy method continues to pin-point on a regular basis. How's that then, pirate, will that do to be going on with? Happy New Year, by the way.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Thanks very much for posting Eye, thats just clarified something I didn't take into account, the ABS crossing the 0 Line. Q. Would you take a short without it crossing? What about for Longs? I'm still having issues re: the correct zoom to use as the LMSA seem to jump around - is there a way to be consistent? I'm curious about the ABS - I haven't heard of it before this thread and there doesn't seem to be much info about it - anyone know how it interprets price? I found this thread as was looking into CCI trading / Woodies stuff which uses the LMSA. I know Dollie referenced Woodie at the start. I'm also curious about peoples journeys here - particularly which trading methods others have tried and discarded before finding dollie? regards Red

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Thanks for your post, mate. I assume by ABS you really mean ASH? The Absolute Strength Histogram? I've no idea whose creation it was. All I know is that it's supposed to move opposite to the RSI2/CCI6, so that when these two cross down, ASH crosses up, thereby creating the orange/blue zone that is so important to our trades in the Dollie method. If you look at the original rules by Dollie at the beginning of the thread, I believe she says that when the RSI2/CCI6 have crossed the zero line, we're looking at a near-safe trade. However, we also need the ASH to cross the zero line in the opposite direction. Re your question about taking a trade before the ASH has crossed........in my opinion, I can give you the answer in 2 words. "Trader's Discretion." It's the same regarding the lsma3. Sometimes, I'm satisfied if the CCI6 is in the zone, because most of the time, it means the lsma3 is following. However, that works better for me on "long" trades, as on "short" trades, the lsma3 really seems to take its time crossing into the orange/blue zone. Most people have difficulties regarding the lsma3 moving around a lot, mate. That's why backtesting this method can be quite difficult. I may be wrong, but I don't think anybody has come up with a satisfactory solution to that yet. As much as I love this Dollie method, I still monitor other methods as well. Maybe I should keep away from the "Trading Systems" section of FF! Someone is always coming up with a well-thought out system, and I don't know about anyone else, but I just can't resist trying them out! Of course, the simpler the better for me. If a chart is posted that looks as if it needs a couple of hours to analyse, I kick the whole thing into touch. Well, it's now 00:30 here in the UK, so I guess I'd better be hitting the sack. Keep posting, Red. This is a great thread, and I hope more people get to discover it and contribute accordingly. Cheers for now.

I would never recommend this strategy because I have been burned by it, but there is one pair and one news event that this might work. Look today at the Eur/CAD this morning. The CAD unemployment news usually causes big moves like that 160 pips in 5 mins. Put a buy and sell order on either side of the move? You may not get filled but what a move. Even if you wait until the move, it is up 60 pips since then. Too early for me but you east coast and U.K.ers should be all over it. Paper trade it. I only like the EUR/CAD on this not the USD/CAD.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hey I just scrolled down at caught you looking at a best combo new system...! I've read it before but trying to find the Holy Grail aint gonna happend but I know what you mean Its finding something else that maybe ticks the boxs -a new angle... Not that Dollie isnt great on its own... Eye - are u a full time trader? I'm also UK based (london) but work duding the day and wondered if its possible to get involved early say 6a.m GMT?

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Yeah, you caught me red-handed! I guess I just can't resist looking at new systems that come along. That's one of the beauties of FF, I'm afraid. I'm up in Cumbria, mate, which is the frozen north at the moment. I had to take early retirement a few years ago, which gives me the opportunity to trade a bit more than maybe people like you who have to go out to work. However, I'm also a carer for my disabled spouse, so my trading can be a bit erratic from time to time. Don't ask me about 6:00am, mate! After years of having to go out on shift work at that time, I resolved to kill myself if I ever caught myself getting out of bed at that time ever again!! Having said that, looking at the charts from 6:00am (which is the European start, I believe), there's usually some good movements at that time, so it seems to be worth getting up for. Sack time now, mate, so I'll say goodnight. Cheers

--- 帖子 #816 ---
A nice cable opportunity which closed a few minutes ago. I've drawn 3 vertical yellow lines.......First one shows our old friend the DZ green/blue cross...........second one brings our attention to the middle window, and a triple-cross through the zero line of the RSI2/CCI6 and the ASH......and the third one shows the entry point. Candle opens just above the Pivot line, and the lsma3 enters the orange/blue zone. The next candle more or less confirms the move as Guppy is separating nicely. The R1 line is a logical target, and the exit is taken there (second green arrow), although the lsma3 didn't exit the zone until the next candle. Even so, a good move, and as usual, indicated nicely by the Dolly/Guppy.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
This could be interesting. I've no idea where this one will go, but a quadruple cross HAS to be taken notice of!!

--- 帖子 #818 ---
You can't win 'em all, and this one turned out to be a dead loss. It just goes to prove that an initial fantastic signal doesn't always work out. Put it down to experience and move on..............

--- 帖子 #819 ---
just wanted to post a chart. Eye/Pirate/otheres - i haven't forgot about Dollie. it is a new year and i'm still scalping and still playing around but the always constant Dollie is still in my charts. I have actually played around with some of the settings (RSI ASH &amp; LSMA) in an attempt to make the window smoother. As you can see I also have added a few new indicators that I am trying that i've found reading through the forum. I take after you Eye... i am always curious and love to try new things. Anyway... once i feel confident with these indicators and their settings i'll post them for all as usual. here is a quick scalp i just got off the Eur/Jpy. It turned out to be a 30+ move so i am very happy. It was unexpected and I almost got out at the S/R line. Guess I was lucky. You'll see that Dollie was prime and my other indicators popped. I started playing with these indicators because i am working on a long term strategy to add to my arsenal. I will always be a short term trader by nature but am intrigued by a Daily strategy that I set and forget.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Yep, you do like messing around with indicators, don't you? Well, why not? You don't know WHAT they'll do until you mess around with them. Having said that, of course, it helps if one knows what they are and what they're for! Looking at your chart, mate, there's one or two that I'm not familiar with, but I guess, like you said, they're there in order to work out your LT strategy. Actually, you've prompted me to try a couple of indicators that I saw on another thread a few days ago. One is another Pivot indicator, but you can scroll back with this one and see where the various pivot lines were on any particular day up to around a month ago. The other indicator is just one that draws what are called psychological lines on the chart at the 00 and 50 points. It's spooky how often price either retraces or consolidates at these levels. Plus, when one of these lines is almost at the same point as a pivot line, it makes it even MORE significant. I got these from another thread, and if you can tell me how to put a link in a post, then I'll point you in the right direction. I still haven't figured out how to post a link yet, and I've been on FF for quite a while now! Anyway, keep on keepin' on, mate, and good luck with your new methods. Cheers

--- 帖子 #821 ---
This is one I've just been watching on usd/jpy, and shows how Guppy can come in very handy in decision-making. The heads-up for this one came whilst price was peaking at the Guppy LT 60ema. As price descended, it was fast approaching the psychological 50 line, so it was worth waiting to see how price would deal with this barrier. However, Guppy was showing a definite inclination to continue dropping, so once price had breached the 50 line (along with the ASH crossing the zero line) plus the very close S1 line (indicating a strong movement), it was time to enter. Price dropped rapidly and breached the 00 line and exit probably should have been at S2, but jumping ship as indicated would still produce a nice profit. I'm still playing with these psychological 00 and 50 lines, so no trade was involved other than demo-ing.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
i hope everyone is getting there share of the green pips this morning. i don't know exactly why (i'm still learning the fundamentals - Pirate you might be able to add some insight) but it has been very exciting. I would imagine any decent trend following system is doing well today.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
where did you find that indicator that draws pivots and S/R lines back a month. That would be a great tool for backtesting. I always have that in the back of my mind when i back test and a move just stalls... is it because of that days S/R or Pivot ect... thanks

--- 帖子 #824 ---
jc, I have no idea how to post a link, so all I can tell you is to go to Trading Systems/Pivot Point, Psyche Levels and Intraday trend lines. The thread was started by Acumen, and is well worth a read. Not too long, either! Indicators are below for anyone who's interested. FXI Pivots automatically draws the pivot points for the day, after moving into position from the previous day. Therefore, you can scroll back and see the points for any particular day. It's a bummer trying to backtest if you're like me and rely on Pivot points, but this little indicator solves that problem. The other indicator (SDX-SweetSpots1(1)) draws the psychological lines at every 00 and 50 point. They can prove to be very strong S/R lines, especially if they almost or exactly coincide with a pivot point. Prices tend to retrace or consolidate at these SweetSpots, but if price moves through them, then it usually indicates a VERY strong move. I don't know whether or not acumen is actually responsible for these indicators, but he deserves full credit for posting them on his thread for anyone to download. Cheers

--- 帖子 #825 ---
thanks eye. i've nver really paid attention to the .0000 or .0050 marks. i'll have to look into that.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
You're entirely welcome, old chap. Have a look at acumen's thread. Like you, I never thought about 00 and 50 lines, but his thread really does make you think. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
here is a quick 20+ move i just got. Dollie was good and i used the pivot point as my target once i got the feeling the price was moving. eye - i read that whole thread on psych and pivot levels last night and it is interesting. i'm going to hold off adding all the psysh lines for now but as you can see the price did stall for 2mins at approx 1.9600... very interesting. also as i type this the cable is has gone long for another 15 pips. oh well there have been plenty of great setups the past 2 days. i hope everyone is doing well.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
here is a eur/jpy move i just nailed. notice how the price went down to 157.38 and then back to 157.50 for another stall... i personally think the price is going to hit the support line at the bottom of the screen but for me 30 pips is enough. As i type the price has gone down to 157.02 towards the support line. I'm still not 100% comfortable basing my trades of these lines yet but i am getting there.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
and just as i get done posting sure enough the support line was hit - 100 pips in 15mins. you got to love it!!!! i wish i got the whole thing. maybe i shouldn't worry about posting LOL. do any of you guys trade with multiple positions and take profit at different times. i have never traded like that but seems to make sense.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hey jc, very nice examples, mate, and a goodly haul of pips! The move by eur/usd below was demo-ed, as I'm still getting used to this particular pivot system and those lovely "sweetspots" that are really starting to convince me! The heads-up indicated by the vertical yellow line was just after RSI2 had crossed below the zero line. The CCI6 crossed shortly after (yellow line) and then it was a matter of waiting for the ASH to cross upwards and it wasn't long coming. Roughly about the same time as the lsma3 entered the orange/blue zone and we were away. You could say that entry was too near the 50 sweetspot, but this is where Guppy earns its corn. It's looking very healthy and widening nicely, so a confident entry was on the cards. The move was VERY strong and price swept down through two resistance lines and three sweetspots before coming to a sudden stop at a major 00 sweetspot. Exit would have been as marked, just before the sweetspot was met. What I like about these candles is the almost total lack of shadows, indicating that this was a VERY STRONG BEARISH movement, with virtually NO opposition from the bulls. (Until it was ambushed at the 00 sweetspot, that is!) From what I've learned about the sweetspots, it seems that if price breaches one, there's a very good chance it will continue on until the next one, or as near as dammit. Alternatively, a pull-back at the sweetspot can, a lot of the time, continue on afterwards and breach the sweetspot at the second attempt. Whatever.......they make great targets!

--- 帖子 #831 ---
eye... check out how the price has bounced off 157.00 eur/yen 3 times already. pretty cool!!! thanks again for steering me to that thread. i wonder how many trades i've been in that ended up being losers because of these pysch lines. at least i'll know going forward to keep an eye on them. it seems they do play a role.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
here is a continuation from the post above. check out how the price as been squeezed between the daily pivot and 157.00 line (only 39 pips) bouncing off the two for the last 5 hours. Now for longer term traders this is probably frustrating but for us short term traders using these two lines as support and resistance could be priceless. I encourage anyone who hasn't to read Acumen's thread as Eyevoltage has recommended to do so. In it he explains why these 00 &amp; 50 lines act the way they do and it does make sense. Well I got up late today - i've been forcing myself up at 4am US eastern time and it has paid off this week. Its time to sharpen the TOMAHAWK and get to work.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
These .0000 and .0050 lines have plainly been of great significance for some time for those "in the know", so it's a bit of an eye-opener when these things are pointed out to you. Obviously, jc has recognized the value of them, as I have, and I can only repeat what he says, and that's to check out Acumen's thread. Below is a nice example of how these things work. There was about an hour between the first "heads-up" (1st yellow vertical) and the eventual entry (2nd yellow vertical). I was waiting for a candle to breach the .0050 line, but I was hesitant with the first two, due to the Guppy action. In the hour between the yellow lines, the Guppy just didn't seem to want to go down, or that's how it seemed to me. So I decided to wait until the yellow 15ema crossed the .0050 line, and then see what was what. It finally crossed and heralded a lovely long bearish candle, with practically no shadows at all. Then next candle was almost the same, although the upper shadow was looking a bit longer than I would have liked. So as the candle hovered around the .0000 line, I jumped ship, just in case. The sensible thing to do, as it turned out! Anyway, the lsma3 was leaving the orange/blue zone, so that confirmed my decision for me. Have a look at the two magenta rectangles after that, though. After my trade position, price had retreated into the Guppy ST's and then starting dropping again before halting right on the major .0000 line. Price then rose again, and without even stopping for breath, punched right through the .0050 line until, once again, it was stopped in its tracks by the major .0000 line, which just happened to be almost on top of the main Pivot Point, thereby strengthening the resistance. Jc was right. This sort of price movement suits us short-term bods, but not those who like the longer-term trading.

last trade of the week - a meager 7 pips. All in all it has been a very good week with lots of volatility. I hope everyone got their share. as for the chart: Dollie was good as were my EMAs and other indicators. I think i have the bands squeeze indicator down (please see http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=57426 - Pivot Point Squeeze thread for more info) but am still playing with the other. Anyway, i jumped into this trade only expecting a few pips and used 156.00 psych line as my target. As i type the price is now bouncing around this level. So very cool. I wish I was aware of these a few months ago. Better now then never I guess!!!

Hey everyone! I'm here also but had to go on a little holiday as the pip pirate turned 50. The pirates of old probably never made it to 50 so it feels good. Went to Las Vegas where it was freezing and actually made money with blackjack. Yes it is true. Now I didn't make enough to pay for the trip but it was fun to walk away with cash. I look at it as a great sign for the new year. I'll be up to speed next week and look forward to some of the changes I am reading. We all are helping each other. Yes I am a pirate Two hundred years too late The cannons don’t thunder There’s nothing to plunder I’m an over 40 victim of fate Arriving too late Arriving too late by Jimmy Buffett So now I plunder pips

Hi Pirate, and congrats on your 50th. A milestone I left behind some time ago, I'm afraid. Still, they do say that it's all downhill after the 50th, meaning things get easier, I suppose, and I sincerely hope that applies to you, mate. Freezing in Vegas? I've never been there, but I always thought deserts were supposed to be HOT places, and freezing at night. As you can see from the postings, jc and I have been busy, so we look forward to you getting back into the swing of things again, mate, and seeing some more of your excellent charts. By the way, mate, I've seen some excellent NFL games over the last few weeks, but I do wish that the Patriots had a bit more competition. The NFL is in danger of getting boring! Cheers for now.

i usually don't trade the asian session but after a very slow afternoon (US Holiday) i decided to give it a go.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I tend (unfortunately) to not pay attention to all the us sessions on holidays, so right when I thought it was time to take a break, before AUD opens, I missed that great move that you got. When jpy stock market opens, this could get interesting.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
look at this great moved i just missed. i was in a trade for over 30min that ened up being a 10 pip loss so i walked away and got involved in a TV show (prison break) only to come back and see this 100 pip move right to the pivot. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! oh well, there is always tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
i hope no one was on the wrong side of this move. i decided not to trade between 8 - 9am NY Eastern time today and let the market do its thing especially with so much mainstream news (CNN &amp; MSNBC) talking about the markets this morning.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
i used dollie and my other indicators as my entry and psych lines as my target. at first i was only going to go for a short scalp and get out at 155.50 but decided to wait and see considering that the price did reach 156. once the price did break 155.50 i made that my SL so i was in a free trade anyway.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
this pair has been hovering around the 156.00 line for the last 2 hours. i'm not doing anything until 156.30 or 155.70 can breached. then i'll decide if the price going to continue to next pysch line or bounce back to 156.00. until then i'm just gonna keep sharping my tomahawk.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
i went long at 156.34 and am aiming for 156.50

--- 帖子 #844 ---
and just got out at 156.17. maybe i should have waited until the next pysch line was broken instead of making up my own random lS &amp; R lines.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
JC: Looking at your last posts, I hope you are open to an observation. The times to trade the eur/jpy isn't in the middle of the US session. The jpy pairs move from the US open to 17GMT, take a break, and then get back in around 19:30GMT to the end of the US session. This is a general trend of course.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
thanks for the advice. you know me.... i'm always open to suggestions. now is that true for most pairs. it never really occurred to me that the big wigs in NYC like to take a lunch and break from the market.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
it took me a few hours but i made up my loss and the price finally hit 156.50, even though it dropped down to 155.50 before this.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
i hope everyone got their share of pips today. the E/J has been going crazy the last few days, bouncing off S/R Lines as well as pysch lines. another couple of weeks like this and i can retire!!!!

Just to show that this indicator also can be successfully used to scalp on a 1 min chart. Here is a trade I just did. EuroYen buy @ 156.86 16:36 Close @ 157.00 @ 16: 39 for a sweet + 14 pips 3 minutes work !:-) Thanks Dollie I enclosed the chart plus my account statement ( the trade in blue) where I actually made the trade 1st vertical red line was my entry 2nd red vertical line was close position So many of these small moves all day long. Go get them !

nice move FX. i to concentrate on the 1min charts. i generally look to the 5min charts and don't trade against the color of the LSMA for example, if it is green on the 5min chart i only go long. good trading and continue posting. it helps all of us.

What is the PT() indicator at the bottom of your chart. It looks like it would really help indicate when the trend starts. Are you going to post it? Thanks, Randy

--- 帖子 #856 ---
I thought it would be a bit easier if I offered you a visual example of what I was talking about in my PM to you. If you look at the first vertical line: This is where the DZ is giving a "heads-up" on a possible short trade. The only other indication is the RSI2 dropping through the zero line in the middle window, so we wait for further developments. The second vertical line indicates where we might enter the trade. Again, the DZ is indicating a green/blue cross. Above, in the middle window, the RSI2, the CCI6 and the ASH are all coming together at the zero line and they end up doing what we want them to do. RSI2/CCI6 cross down through the zero line, and the ASH crosses up, creating the orange/blue trading zone. I told you that I don't usually wait for the lsma3 to enter the zone, but rather I follow the CCI6 as THAT enters. You could enter there, but preferably, it would be better to wait until the next candle closes and the one after that opens up under the M2 line. As you can see, there is then a nice drop to the S1 line, yielding around 40 pips or so. Exit the trade as the lsma3 leaves the orange/blue zone and that little spinning top/doji type candle forms. I hope that's clear enough for you, mate. If not, give us a yell!! Cheers for now.

Hi eyevoltage, and others that are trading this method for a while. I am going to post two pics of trades, with my analysis, I would really appreciate any feedback to see if my thinking is ok. thanks in advance. Since the ST lines are above the LT lines, we are looking for longs. The first vertical line gives us a confirmed cross of the orange and blue lines. Second vertical line gives a confirmed RSI2 above 0 line, and also cci above 0. Third vertical line gives us an entry at close of candle as lipsa turns green at close of this candle. Seems like a pretty good trade as the next candle gives us 40pips with quite some ease. But my analysis is that this would have been a no trade, as the ASH did not come down from 0 line in the most recent candles. Yes it did cross the 0 line, but that was like 8 hrs ago. What say you? Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
This is the second pic. The first vertical line gives us a cross and the ash above 0 line. second vertical line gives us a red lsma, and third vertical line gives us the entry at close of candle. Thanks in advance. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Ok, while taking those pics and setting up my charts, I came across a potential problem, that I could encounter. Not to say you guys would, but to me it adds a variable, and that is something that I do not like. This 0 line that is so critical to our entry criteria for the ASH to cross, or the lsma to cross (optional), will change with the degree of zoom for both of them, because it is only set for the RSI2. So the 0 line is for the rsi, so if u zoom in, it can cause what might first look on the ASH crossing, to appear to have not crossed, and vice versa on the zoom out. Have you guys noticed this, and how do you handle it, or is it not that impt? Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Two nice examples of taking the time to analyse before jumping in or not!! Happily, Dollie gave us a method of trading that seems to have stood the test of time, but like any other method, it's important to do a little patient analysis before making any decision. Taking your first example: I would have been hesitant to take any trade in a market that is so obviously moving sideways, with the Guppy LT's totally compressed, indicating indecision, consolidation or just plain "We're happy where we are!" Sure, the ST's can yield pips in such a situation, but IMHO, it's usually best to stay out until the MMA's start moving up or down again. The particular position you indicated, Kermut, is also right under a pivot point, which is always a nuisance, as you then have to wait for a possible cross in order to improve one's R/R. On top of that, as you pointed out, the ASH has been trailing along the bottom for 8 hours or so, so that any trade would be reliant solely on the RSI2/CCI6 before looking to see what the lsma3 is going to do. Much better for the ASH to be seen to come swooping down from an OB position as the price moves up. As for your second example, Kermut, I can't see anything wrong with it at all. Price has been testing the Pivot line a few times, and finally manages to breach it. Your 2nd and 3rd vertical lines are significant in that, in my opinion, it's an area in this particular example where a measure of traders discretion comes into play. You COULD enter at the 2nd vertical, as the candle has opened just under the Pivot line. However, the lsma3 isn't in the zone yet. (Sticking strictly to the rules, it SHOULD be in the zone to trigger a trade, but, in my opinion, this isn't always necessary). You mentioned entering at the close of the candle under the 3rd vertical. Why not enter at the opening? After all, if you take a look at what's happening with the Guppy MMA's, there's every reason at this point to be confident of a good trade from that point, with a nice target such as S1 to aim for, which it eventually reached. As far as your query regarding the lsma3 is concerned, I got tired of trying to figure out what the hell it was going to do next quite a while ago. For entry points now, I look at the CCI6 and wait for THAT to enter the orange/blue zone, then wait for a suitable entry point, should it appear. The only thing I WILL say in favour of the lsma3, is that it usually pin-points where one should exit the trade, and that's as it crosses out of the orange/blue zone. The ideal situation for a short entry is for the RSI2/CCI6 to cross the zero line down as the ASH crosses up, with the lsma3 entering the orange/blue zone right away, with the reverse being true for long trades. Sadly, this isn't always the case. Still, a little caution and common-sense never came amiss! Hope this helps you, mate. Cheers

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Unfortunately, I wasn't around when this one kicked-off, but it's worth showing because of how each indicator comes into play. As you can see at the first yellow vertical, nothing much is happening.....price is just trundling along sideways, with the ASH around the OS zone and the lsma3 way up around the OB zone. However, the RSI2 has just crossed the zero line, with the DZ green/blue crossing just before the second yellow vertical, which, in its turn, shows the CCI6 following the RSI2 down below the zero line. Then follows a waiting period of nearly half-an-hour before things start developing. The third yellow vertical shows the DZ RSI2 (green line) pushing below the red dotted line, whilst in the middle window, ASH is starting to rise, creating the beginnings of the orange/blue zone, which CCI6 is starting to enter. It's still not time to enter the trade, however, because of the close proximity of the S1 line. Once price crosses this, THEN we can choose to enter the trade. The fourth yellow vertical gives us everything we want....the widening and separating of the Guppy MMA's, price dropping below the S1 line and lsma3 finally entering the orange/blue zone, and the Label (1.58720) indicates approximately where an entry would be made. From then on, with Guppy MMA'S continuing to widen, it's a breeze, with price dropping nicely, until it gets very near the M0 line which is a good place to jump ship at 1.57481 with a nice profit (fifth yellow vertical). There's no doubt that the Dollie method requires a lot of screen time, watching and waiting for everything to come together in this particular TF, which is why an hourly method was developed by Dollie and Pip Pirate2, amongst others. If the longer TF interests you, then read the whole thread, as longer TF's just aren't my "thing"!! Cheers

--- 帖子 #862 ---
What is the best way to start with this method considering it really being modified quite a bit. Any advice please.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Hi eyevoltage, Thanks for the most recent chart and an excellent explaination. But I have a few issues I need clarification on. - the chart is a 5M chart, and I thought this method was not suited to something belwo 15M, as the ash and rsi will be crossing toooo often, giving us lots of chop - as per my understanding, the entry would have been at the close of the candle you mark as entry at open. My reasoning is that it isn't till the close o that candle we get an ASH cross of the 0 line, and also the close of that candle is below S1. I have an entry somewhere around 1.5880. No doubt that the profit is still quite good, ie 50pips or so, but I just can not see how it would have been an entry where u have market it at candle open. - also, this move was entirely news driven. So do we take trades that setup due purely to news? As always, appreciate your insight. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
As with any method that you take an interest in, the best advice is to read the whole thread from start to finish. As you read and absorb, (and stay interested), then I can guarantee that you'll do what various others on this thread have done. Quite simply, you'll begin to play around with it, adding here and taking away there, until you'll end up with your very own adaptation that suits your "psyche" down to the ground. Time and patience, mate. That's all it takes. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Yes, my chart is a 5m chart, and the reason for this is because I prefer to work with shorter TF's. Sometimes I'll drift up to 15m, but that's it. There are others who have appeared on this thread who prefer longer TF's, and conversely, there is one who took it right down to 1m and scalped with a lot of success. I guess the message here is that Dollie will work on any TF, and ultimately, it's down to the individual to nail down his own style. Regarding your second query.....I recall saying recently that sometimes trader's discretion has to come into play, and this is one of those times. From my own point of view, the orange/blue zone had already formed before ASH crossed the zero line. I did say in a recent post that sometimes I go with the CCI6 rather than the lsma3, and seeing as the CCI6 was safely inside the zone, it would be safe to enter the trade. Especially, as I pointed out, Guppy MMA's were showing a very healthy downtrend, and my entry would have been below the S1 line, as per the label (remember, I didn't actually take this trade - I was merely theorising). The arrow wasn't indicating an entry, but rather the candle where the entry took place. Additionally, if I remember correctly, Dollie herself said at the beginning of this thread that once the RSI2/CCI had crossed the zero line, she considered it to be a "safe" trade. Still, I guess each of us has to make our own judgements regarding each opportunity. In other words, my entry point would have been a result of MY judgement, and your entry point a result of YOURS. Kermut, if you want to take trades that are news-driven, then do so by all means. Each to his own and all that. I can't recall any rule in this method that says you shouldn't. All I can say is judge each potential opportunity as it comes along. Weigh each piece of the puzzle up in your mind, and only if your judgement says go, then GO! Hope this helps. Cheers

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Hi eyevoltage, Many thanks for your reply. I agree that most methods require some sort of discretion, and a bit of common sense. What I am trying to do is basically weed out all the discretion situations, and gather all the common sense available http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif The reason I mentioned abt the 5M chart was because most of your charts previously have been 15M. I too am a shorter tf trader, 5M and 15M, don't think I have ever taken a trade off the hourly. But everything I have used for the 5M, seems to be good when the trades are good, but can be subject to a lot of chop as well. Hence I have primarily focused on the 15M charts. The other thing I am looking at atm, is once a signal has been triggered on the 15M charts, I go to the 5M charts, and look to enter as the 5M chart is going in the opp section to the 15M signal trigger. Seems to reduce the sl a bit, and if I have the balls to stick with it, seems to increase the tp. After reading ur reply about the trigger candle, do you enter mid-bar, ie if the candle opens just above a pivot, and then starts to move past it, do you wait for candle close or enter at market? I realise that trader discretion may play a role here, but assuming that all criteria are met according to what "we" are looking for, I just want to see what someone who has been trading this for a while is doing. I just ask about trading around news, mainly to get a perspective. Since you have been trading this for a while, I am assuming you have seen what valid signals have done during news times. As someone once said "Learn from other's mistakes, as life is too short for one to make all of them and learn" http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif I know a trader who has his own tech trading system (pr%$#K won't share it, lol) whereby he takes every signal. No discretion on entry, doesn't care if big ben is speaking in the next 1 min or not, and his hit rate is 85%. Hence, my question to you since you have been trading this for a while. Looking forward to your reply and some more charts. I shall do my best to post charts as well, but they won't be pure dollie charts, as I love my stochs. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
please go to this link for the PT indicator i had on my screens... it is at the bottom of the page. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=46667 it is nice to see dollie getting a resurrgence. this is by far one of the better technical systems on the FF in my opinion and helped me bag many green pips!!! i have moved away from this system because i feel it gets me into short positions late and was frustrating to me. for those new to the thread follow eye's lead... dollie + guppy= many positive trades.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Just a quick reply, mate, as it's waaaaay past my bedtime! I'm glad you agree with regard to trader discretion. This is something that we all have to face and deal with from time to time. Actually, I prefer it, because I don't like the idea of an EA telling me when to trade, which is why I never use one. I much prefer the hands-on approach. However, I do have a fair amount of time to spend in front of the screen these days, so it's a bit easier than for someone with a full-time job. I personally don't trade around major news events, mate. I try and keep up to speed with news announcements, but I do tend to forget about them, unfortunately! I note that you ended your post by saying: "I do love my stochs". Me too, mate, which is why I don't trade Dollie exclusively. Since I read Spud's threads and boxingislife's, my eyes have been opened to the magic of Stochastics!! Now I really must hit the sack. Probably see you tomorrow, mate. Cheers

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Hi Eyevoltage, Noticed you were in England, and man, it is wayyyyy past your bedtime. ANZAC day here so a bit quite at work, hence I can post at these times. Looks like we seem to be thinking the same on a few things. Spud and boxingislife threads really did catapult my trading. Then, along came Harold (key to the ming), and that really made me look at things much better than I did. Also, in boxingislife's thread, Melphos has really added fantastic value to the method, and I am using his settings of using the signal line rather than the main line (as is the norm). I too personally am not a fan of using EA's the way most ppl use it. The only thing I would use an EA is as an alert rather than a signal. I just can not trust the machine to put me into a trade, but just not trust it enough to get me out. And getting out is what makes us manage risk. The only thing I do in addtion here is have a few moving averages to give me direction. I have found after a lot of lossessssss, is that trying to trade long and short on the same day is giving yourself the oppurtunity to end the day negative. I only trade in the direction of my directional bias. Though, I might start looking at how the guppy shows direction as compared to my ma. Would love to hear how u use the stochs and what settings. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Hi jcblcs79, Since you were doing so well with this method on the 1M tf (though it is a bt too fast and furious for me), what have you found that is better than this? Care to share? Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Re your last message......I realize that I didn't respond to a couple of your questions. Yes, I used to use 15m a lot with this method, but I narrowed it down to 5m and it seemed to be just as satisfactory. Naturally, one has to be a little more careful with each shorter TF, as one doesn't have a lot of time to make decisions. Dollie is a great system, but I found (by trying different things) that Guppy is so visual that it's VERY good at keeping one out of a lot of bad trades. As an aside, I saw that lever70 of Cornflower fame likes to scalp the Guppy on 1m charts when she's in the mood. Just goes to show how versatile Guppy is. Entering a trade in Dollie is easy with Guppy backing you up. If all else looks ok, but Guppy doesn't look quite healthy yet, then it's worth waiting for things to improve. We're all looking for the lowest risk trades, so patience is the watchword here. As for the candlesticks......if entry point is too close to the pivot line, making R/R a ridiculous possibility, then wait, wait, wait. When the candle crosses the pivot line, I enter only if conditions are as I described above. Guppy has to look strong and healthy, with a lovely widening of the MA's and a good separation between the LT's and the ST's. I remember Dollie saying in one of her earlier posts that she finds it difficult to see how one could lose points on this method, and she's right. If each step is observed properly, and all conditions are met, then we have a low-risk trade. My opinion only, but I'm just agreeing with Dollie! As far as trading around newstimes are concerned, mate, I have to agree with the more knowledgeable people on this forum and say that it's best to close any trades if there are major news reports due. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. However, nobody's perfect, least of all me, and I have been slightly burned once or twice when I've forgotten about them. Still, no major damage if one is using a short TF and a reasonable SL. By the way, I've sent you a PM re the Stochs thingy. Cheers

I have adopted the laguerre's from Imran's Scalping thread along with guppy. I actually see myself getting away from all these indicators and following price action more as well as keeping an eye on the fundamentals. I always had a problem trading and not knowing why a currency pair was moving and trading solely on technicals. Once i started to understand many of the fundamental reasons why currency pairs move i noticed my confidence increased 100%. I'm fortunate enough to be able to watch the 1min charts all morning (USA 5am - 10am) and noticed after hours and hours of screen time i was getting into successful trades both with and without dollie's confirmation. i don't know why but dollie's system really helped me get an understanding for price action and to see moves happening plus i started to only concentrate on one pair... eur/yen. again... i love dollies system and think added with guppy it is a very safe technical system and very good for beginners or those lost (as i was before i found this system last july). good trading to all!!!!

Hi Hous Yes, what a pitty. I had once about 13 positive trade in a row each pocketing about 15-25pips profit per trade. It really works but I just hadn't had the time to follow the charts. Go for it!

--- 帖子 #876 ---
I'm using it on the 5 min time frame and it's great for scalping 15 pips. The euro is the best pair but others i check are the cable, aussie and eur/jpy. I had 3 sucessful trades out of 3 this morning ny session for a total of 45 pips profit. I use a 15 pips stop loss plus spread and shoot for 15 pips take profit. If it ranges for 45 minutes or more I'll just try to grab 5-10 pips. It's better than nothing. I wait for the cross of the rsi crossing the absolute strenghth and wait for the candle to close. Then i enter on the next candle. It wins 70% of the time. I use my own version of a guppy to keep me out of bad trades or ranging market. And i don't trade around news announcements. I also put a 150 ema on my charts and if price is above I only trade long. If price is below I only trade shorts. Try it , it's pretty close to the holy grail. Paris

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Oh yes, and don't take any new signals after 1:00PM EST as the market really slows down. If you do take a signal just go for 5-10 pips. Paris

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Thanks Paris That's really helpful coz I am getting a little confused with which signal to take and at what time. I am trying to use Dollie v2 and has been taking quick profit with a little success.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Paris What is your chart setup like? How do you interpret the guppy and tell whether it's a good trade or not? Thanks a bunch! This is definitely the best system ever

--- 帖子 #880 ---
I think i found the holy grail with this system. Or close to it. I'm using a 9,3,3, 80/20 stochastic along with the dolly indicator in a separate window. When the stochastic is in the over sold or overbought area and beginning to turn, this is a time to look for a signal with the rsi crossing the asi dolly indicator. If the price is above the 150 ema i only look for longs. And if the price is below the 150 ema i only look for shorting. On the 1 hour chart EUR/USD I use a 120 pip take profit and an 80 pip stop loss. Trades will usually run for 1 to 2 days and there's about 3 signals a month on this pair. I manually back tested it all the way back to the beginning of March and it wins 3 out of 4 trades using the stoch and dolly. Even if it only won 2 out of 3 trades ( which it does) you would clean up because of the risk to reward ratio. You can move stop loss to break even when price makes 70-80 pips of profit. Some cases it'll go up to 105 pips and then return to zero but that happens seldom. 120 pip take profit is a good number on the euro for this time frame. I'm going to test cable , aussie and Eu/JPY to see what parameters i can come up with these pairs. And really euro and cable is all you need. Profit, profit, profit and holy grail. It works. Paris

--- 帖子 #881 ---
I'm going to test it with the cable but i won't be able to do this until Friday. For the cable i'll use parameters of 135 take profit with a 90 pip stop loss. Then maybe someone will be able to build an EA for this method. Where the stochs are in oversold or overbought and starting to turn and then a cross of the rsi through the absolute strength indicator. Then enter at the beginning of the next candle. There's not a whole bunch of signals but they're very high probability. Only winning half the time would make you profit but it does much better than this. I 'll back test cable, aussie and eur/jpy they'll all have different parameters as they all have different ranges. 4 pairs that trend nicely. Paris

--- 帖子 #882 ---
What's nice about the dolly indicator is it get rid of alot of false moves and fake outs that the stochatics often gives. When both are aligned with stochs in oversold/bouught and then a cross with the dolly indicator it gives a solid signal. Unlike if you were just using stochs where you'd get faked out quite often. Both work in harmony beautifully. Paris

Another suggestion is if you don't want to use the 150 ema you can just check the daily time frame to see the long term direction and just take trades in that direction. If the market has been ranging you can either take no trades at this time or just go for a smaller take profit such as 50 or 60 pips until the market starts trending again. I made a quick glance on the aud/usd and the results were very good winning at least 2 out of 3 trades recently with a 135 pip take profit and 90 pip stop loss. With the parameters and rules of the stochs and dollie indicator. I've bought countless courses and ebooks and trading videos etc. and this method with the dolly and stochastics beats them all for consistent profit. Looks very promising. Paris

Thank you very much for sharing, Paris! I will definitely give it a shot. But there is also a query in my mind How do you deal with the shifting nature of the LCMA...or it could just be ignored? For the Dollie RSI, so if 150EMA is up and it goes oversold, we buy? This is like really rare occurrence isn't it? Also, as a side comment, I am looking into the BBSqueez indicator from here. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=503 Seems like if there are red bar/ blue bar (breakout from BBand Squeez) If Dollie gives the signal as well, the trade seems pretty safe. Just an initial observation. Thanks again. Hope I can be as successful as you are Houston ps I have some EA programming exp. for another platform, once I get familiar with MQL and figure dollie w/stoch out, i will try my best...

You can try it without the 150 ema and it seems to work well with more signals. I noticed that especially with the cable as it was ranging alot more and the ema would of stood in the way of many winning trades. I'll check out the BB sqeeze indicator. I don't use the lcma indicator. I don't see any useful purpose and it lags.Thanks, Paris

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Well bollinger squeese aint it. It failed miserably and lags way too much. The stochs with the dolly work much better. Just did some back testing and it was lousy. Sorry. Paris

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Sorry...how do you overlay indicators in one window?? I try dragging from the indicator list, from the custom indicator insert drop down, etc I cant get an indicator to overlay over another. How do I do it in MT4. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #888 ---
I have the stochs and dolly indicator in separate windows. Just drop each indicator in the same window when setting up dolly. I use the dolly template v2 and everything i need is in there. As for the 150 ema a good rule is when the ema is rising only take long trades. When the ema's is declining only take shorts. When the ema is mainly flat you can take trades in either direction as long as you have a valid signal on dolly and the stochs. This works well. Paris

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Also download the template from the previous post and store in your MT folder. Save you boat load of trouble

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Does it? You have every single trade possible since the beginning of global markets? Do you guarantee it won't lose 31% of the time? I get tired of the stupid baseless claims (probably derived from 10 trades)

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Then you should stop coming to this forum if you don't want to hear facts. It's obvious you are a struggling trader with a diminishing trading account. If you have nothing constructive to add stay far away from this thread. We don't need you.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Paris, Love to know your view/result on cable when you are done I still can't quite tell how the cross get you away from bad bad trades because there are quite a few crossing around the overbought/sold area sometime before it actually starts the other way round. How do you confirm that the cross is actually something big? Now that there is no LSMA at the middle... Do you use the CCI entering the zone as a guideline? Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #893 ---
So far, I am liking how dollie-stoch is working on E/Y on H4. Many times when the stoch exits the the oversold zone(with slow and fast line diverging), while at the same time RSI/CCI crosses sharply with ASI. It's a good long opportunity... Am I decoding this correctly, Paris? Seems like it's kinda hard to tell when it comes to short because dollie rarely spread big and wide like Lond trades do. Any tips on catching shorts? Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!

--- 帖子 #894 ---
The cci should be around zero or below zero for shorts and on or above zero for longs. As far as the stochs, I look for them to at least touch the 80/20 zone and if it goes into that area all the better. Then when they just start to turn or cross with each other i'll look for a confirmation signal with the dolly indicator. Sometimes the signal from dolly doesn't come until stochs are already moving a ways down/up but i use dolly as the trigger after the stochs touch or go into over sold/bought. Paris

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Thanks Paris Think i need to observe the occurrence a little longer to get a feel of the action

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Totally wish I caught this HUGH H4 Cable sell signal on Dollie-Stoch! 1000pips! Seriously doubt I have the stomach to hold on for the whole run

--- 帖子 #897 ---
I just got done scalping 13 pips on the eur/jpy on the 5 min! Yeah, I like the long term time frames too. Just got to figure out take profit and stop loss parameters for 4 hr and daily.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Paris, When you scalp, how much higher TF you use to gauge the overall trend? All the way up to H4? I remember you mentioning guppy for scalping. Do you trade only when guppy opens up? Or is there any criteria you look at as well

--- 帖子 #899 ---
I don't look at other time frames when scalping on 5 min time frame just the 150 ema. I use the guppy very much when scalping and yes only when it opens up. Then on the retracement with stochs and dolly giving signal. The only thing i don't like about scalping is the risk to reward ratio. You're forced to win at least 2 out of 3 . I use a 15 pip stop plus spread and go for 10-15 pips take profit. So today I got 13 and 10 on eur/jpy and 10 on eur/usd. 3 winners for 3 today. On the 15 min time frame i go for about 30 pips with stop the same so a 1 to 1 risk to reward. I need more ideas for the 5 min time frame. a 10 pip stop loss just isn't enough. Paris

--- 帖子 #900 ---
I use this gmma for my guppy plus i add a 20 ema and 30 ema with thicker lines to complete the guppy.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
"Stop coming to the forum?" I've been "coming to the forum" for 2 more years than you have. Sadly, your ignorant statements show that you are as smart as your username. Yeah Paris, I can't handle FACTS.... which is exactly why I fabricated this whole lie.... your 7 of 10 successful trades should be taken as ultimate truth.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Thanks Paris Really appreciate your insight. Think I need some more demo trades to get a feel of how this work. And yeah, scalping is always poor in R/R ratio. Guess it's just becoz dollie-stoch can up the edge Thanks

I'm liking the look of this system, I was wondering whether the previous active participants (EyeVoltage in particular) were still using the system, and whether 5M or 15M is the most appropriate TF The lsma seems to be an almost useless component of the system in realtime, as EyeVoltage pointed out some time ago. As an example, during last week's weakening of GBP - the end of the first 5M bar of GBPJPY after the BOE inflation report showed lsma as being extremely oversold, yet scroll on an hour or 2 and it was overbought on the same bar. It's up and down more than a bride's nightie! I like the rest of the system though, particularly the almost simultaneous zero crosses of the RSI and CCI, this seems to bring some real trading opportunities Andy B

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Hi Andy I've actually asked eyevoltage the exact ques on PM. He seems to be taking a more simplistic approach. You can find his latest post over in this thread. Hope he doesn't mind me answering his question http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=98028 About the LCMA, personally, I tried very hard learning dollie 1, so I am still used to seeing LCMA sticking in the middle. Yes, it's somewhat useless at times but it gives me a little more confidence... Houston

--- 帖子 #905 ---
I remember saying that the lsma3 indicator annoyed the hell out of me, because of the way it seemed to jump around all the time. Additionally, when used as an entry signal for a "short" trade, it seemed like it was saying "get in" about half-way down the move, if you see what I mean. It was a bit better signalling entry for a "long" trade. However, I found it to be an excellent EXIT indicator. Which is why, when I was using Dollie/Guppy on a regular basis, I started relying on the RSI2/CCI6 combination, and waiting for the CCI6 to enter the "zone", before pulling the trigger. A lot of the time, this happened whilst lsma3 was still making its mind up! So, basically, for a long trade, take the CCI6 and lsma3 into account.....they seem to work better in long trades. For short trades, rely on the CCI6, whilst keeping an eye on lsma3. However, for both long AND short trades, watch for the lsma3 leaving the zone. It's usually a good signal. Bear in mind that this isn't carved in stone. It's just what seemed to work for me at the time. Cheers

How is everyone doing with the dolly indicator? I have now developed my trading plan with my dolly stochastics method and have been making money and pips hand over fist. I'm only trading ny session and i don't trade a half hour before or after news announcements. I'm hitting about a 75% success rate. I'm only using the 5 min time frame on the eur/usd for live trading. I set my take profit to 10 pips and stop loss at 15 pips for the scalp! Today i was up about an hour before ny session and i went 3 for 3 today for a nice +30 pips profit. There's usually at least 1 trade every day. it won't make you rich overnight but it will make you profitable guarnateed! Even if you win just 2 out of 3 you'll still make profit. Some days you'll have no losses. I wait until the guppy is opening up and beginning to trend in one direction. If the guppy is bouncing back and forth there is no trade. You'll be trading off the retracement. This is the best scalping method i have. I use the guppy i posted on this forum ( attachment) plus i add the 20 ema and 30 ema to complete it. Then i wait for stochs to either touch 80/20 line or go into over sold/bought and start to turn. Then i look for the rsi to cross the absolute line and enter right at the begiining of the next candle and set my tp and sl. Then i walk away and check back 10-15 minutes later. It works like vodoo for a nice 70% strike rate at least on eur/usd. I haven't had a losing day yet! If you can't make money with this you need to hang up your scalping shoes. Paris

Hi Paris, It would be very useful if u could post an example, particularly re the guppy opening up. You can get false signals on the indi itself, it would be gr8 if u showed visually what u look for, in the guppy, indi plus stochs in the right sequence. Thanks Paris. Pardy

--- 帖子 #908 ---
I agree with Pardy. TIA!

--- 帖子 #909 ---
be sure to tell us about your first 10 consecutive losses with the same vivacity. honestly, stop filling the newb's heads with these outrageous claims of guaranteed profits and "easy as pie" mindsets.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Hi All, I am still learning Paris way of using dollie. However, there is an example from today's chart that can illustrate what Paris mean on the entry signal. Notice the three red arrows. 1) Guppy starts to open in it LT direction 2) Stoch turning away from overbought 3) Wait for the dollie cross Then two red lines show the entry and 10 pip+spread exit

--- 帖子 #911 ---
anyone still using this method? from what I remember it repainted the lsma like a mutha f*cker was a very intriguing system tho

--- 帖子 #912 ---
The repainting of the lsma was the reason I rejected it. In very strong trends it is useless. The recent decline in the JPY pairs was a great illustration. A big drop in price showed the lsma as extremely oversold. Look back at the same chart a couple of hours later and the lsma was strongly overbought at the same point it was previously strongly oversold. Backtesting is worse than useless, and forward testing is expensive! Andy

--- 帖子 #913 ---
This system still works well if you use it with other supporting tools, like xMeter, Probability meter those sort. From my understanding, some of the good traders of this method, like Paris Hilton, Eyevoltage... have dropped the LSMA.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Can someone post a template of the newest, successful version of this method?

--- 帖子 #915 ---
hi, please where do i get the cci6 indicator. if it is possible please can u tell me. Thanks, ra

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Hi, Please can u tell me the how do i get overlay the indicators. if it is possible. Thanks, Ra

--- 帖子 #917 ---
To create an overlay of two indicators or more.. first add the first indicator to your chart. Then go to view and navigator. Click to open your custom indicators (if a custom indicator is what you want to use) and select it and just hold down your mouse and drag it over and on top of the first indicator. You can do that with more indicators if need be to set up your custom indicator window/overlay Brian

--- 帖子 #918 ---
sorry im not sure how to overlay the indicators with mt4

--- 帖子 #919 ---
thank you very much for your help

--- 帖子 #920 ---
I am trying out this indicator; and sorry if I am missing something which would make this a dumb question; but I just have to ask the following: When looking at a one hour chart I cant help but notice that when I zoom out the deep pink absolutestrengthhistogram line appears to change level!! what? Am I missing something? I thought this was only supposed to happen if I switched to another time frame for instance I do hope that its just something I dont get; because otherwise the system would appear to be useless I hope someone with a clue can reply; thank you

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Somebody has to know the answer. What happens is for instance the blue line, the RSI line, is way above the zero line when zoomed in and way above it when zoomed out. Am I the only one noticing this? I'd really like to know if exploring this system is worth my time, but don't feel like reading the nine hundred replies to find out.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Read my post on the previous page (post 903 I think) This component of the system makes it unworkable in my opinion, and is the reason this thread has been dead for the best part of 2 years

--- 帖子 #371 ---
THANKS Andy B for notifying me of that; I read your post and would interpret it as you find the LSMA unreliable The question I have for you then is: Have you noticed the other components of the system "acting up"; or are the cci and rsi crossing over the absolutestrengthhistogram reliable signals? I am basically wondering if I am the only one experiencing the RSI line changing level relative to the zero line depending on whether one zooms in or out Is the general consensus that the main problem with the system is related to the LSMA line and that otherwise it is workable?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I didn't notice the RSI line changing level, but then it's some time since I used the system

--- 帖子 #373 ---
With all due respect, (I do mean that) I think you guys have the wrong attitude. It is certainly true that the LSMA (and the RSI?) shifts all over the place; but that's not a reason to write off the combination indi. Ever simply overlay two CCIs? They shift all over the place. But the double CCI is an extremely useful tool (just ask the Woodies fans!). All it took was somebody actually coding the two indicators into one rather simply overlaying. Why not do the same for Dollie's combo indi? So, a challenge to FF coders: can anyone code the four original indicators into one to address the shifting? I know nothing about coding but the success with other inidcators gives me reason to hope. This strategy is too good to trash just because of the LSMA's quirks. P.S. Thanks for a first-rate system, Dollie. Good pips to you all. bonnevie

--- 帖子 #374 ---
After studying several system in FF, I think dollie is very promising for holy grail. Even in exotic pairs like aud/cad or eur/cad is still win in 4H. I think the idea using combination lsma, absolute histo, rsi and cci is briliant. But it rather difficult to make ea, because crossing lsma , absolute histo, rsi and cci in different scale. It can be noticed visually, but how programmed in ea. Maybe all expert ea can help.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hello. Any news about this system? Thanks

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi, is there anyone still using this strategy ? Please help. Thanks
