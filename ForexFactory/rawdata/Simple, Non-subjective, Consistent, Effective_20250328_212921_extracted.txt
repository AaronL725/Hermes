Hello. I'd like to share a strategy that adheres to the principles of being simple, non-subjective, consistent, and most importantly effective. If a trading strategy is not based on sound ideals it is doomed from the start, no matter how many indicators or filters you throw at it. Beginners please understand this. This thread is open to all. One of the benefits of the above four principles is that anyone can learn the mechanics of the system quickly, because it is not complicated. This does not mean you will be successful quickly. The real work lies in the application of the strategy day in and day out, and trusting in the process of your edge proving itself over time. But basically this is a freestyle thread. Feel free to post comments, ideas, trades, whatever you want. As long as it's positive, productive, and in-line with the topic. I will post the rules up front, and then if there is any interest we might discuss how the four principles relate to the strategy. The goal is to stack H1 and H4 positions in the direction of the daily and weekly trend. How is this accomplished? 1. Buy only if price is up on the day 2. Sell only if price is down on the day 3. All H4 engulfing bars may be taken 4. H1 engulfing bars are ideal after a pullback, but not required 5. Trigger is a spread +1 break of the engulfing bar 6. Stop is 10 pips below previous swing low or engulfing bar 7. Move stop to break-even at 1:1RR, and hold for minimum 2:1RR. Once a comfortable 2:1 has been achieved, meaning 3:1 or 4:1, move stop to 2:1. Then either hold on for the ride or trail behind previous closed daily or H4 candle. 8. Previous monthly, weekly, and daily high/lows will be the only lines used for support/resistance. These lines can also be used for profit targets and directional bias. For example, it would be prudent not to sell into a market that has just broken its previous weekly or monthly high. 9. Each trade in a stack is treated as a separate position unto itself Attached Image (click to enlarge) From this chart example, you can see there were potentially 5 stacking signals in the last 2-3 days. All signals triggered above their respective daily opens, and all triggered on the next candle. The only exception is signal #3, which I would consider more of a 2-bar engulf pattern (the yellow arrow being on bar 2). Price has also recently broken its previous weekly high, while also breaking previous daily high at least the last three days in a row. Both are excellent indications of further upward bias. Take note of the Multi-meter in the top right corner. H1 through MN1 are all up relative to their current opens. If you had taken any or all of these signals, there would be absolutely no reason to exit any of them at this point. Quite the opposite. You'd be looking to stack as many valid positions in this direction as you can, until the market proves your positions wrong. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is a more detailed look at stacking on the H4 chart, same pair. Entries and exits were rounded to the nearest 5 pips for ease of example's sake. All signals closed up on their respective opens, and all triggered on the next bar. There would be no reason to exit any of these positions yet. Not every engulfing bar in line with daily trend will provide stacking opportunities like this. Some will be stopped out. Some will be flatted. This is what it's supposed to look like when you're doing it right. Ultimately the market will dictate the frequency and length of the signals. The best we can do is consistently put ourselves on the right side of the probabilities. One very important thing to note in the second screenshot example. Take into context the 'playing field' in which the signals came into being. Price had recently broken previous monthly high, and then consecutively broke previous weekly high two times in a row. Look at the candle that broke monthly high: solid. The candle that broke weekly high the first time: dominant. The candle that broke weekly high the second time: dominant. This market is screaming long at the moment. Context has a huge impact on how a single engulfing bar can be interpreted. Stack H4 and H1 together at the same time, in the same direction. Be more selective with the H1 signals. Lastly, just a few short lines to think about from a book called 'Trading in the Zone.' 1. Anything can happen in the market 2. You don't need to know what will happen next to be successful 3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for a given edge 4. An edge is defined as an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another 5. Every moment in the market is unique Thank you.

Very interesting (and similar to H4 power by 60minutes). I'm in AP3

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Ap3 could you please share this prev high/low indicator?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Yes I have read some of his Buy/Sell Line thread. It's a very good one, and I recommend it to anyone interested in simple, clean, and profitable trading. I have not had a chance to check the H4 Power out. Did not know there was a new one by him. But I'm sure he will tell you, just as I will, that these are time-tested principles, and they are nothing new. Except maybe a few tweaks here and there to suit the particular trader. I surely can't take credit for the philosophy behind the strategy, but maybe a couple of the particular rules.

Very nice approach, this will make money, my instant gut instinct would be to look at NOT moving stops so soon and also to explore much much longer holds on these trades. Good luck and it's nice to see a thread using R/R to secure big profits instead of high win rates. I imagine the optimum R/R for this kind of strategy will be up above 10/1 R/R and a win rate below 50%, around 35%....

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks 60, it does make money. I hear you on the stops. This is just a rule that has organically evolved into my trading over the years. Let me explain the reasoning. We are taking engulfing bars, so there is momentum behind the candle, or at least we'd like there to be. Because of this, price should ideally move from entry with momentum. These are the kinds of trades I want to be in. If price is uncertain about its direction after entry, flipping between profit and loss for awhile, I want out. My goal is to get in, reduce risk as quickly as possible, THEN give the trade room to breathe and grow. Don't get me wrong, I flat a TON of trades, but I'm ok with that. I totally agree with you on RR. The example in post 1 is only a quick reference guide for the entry and exit mechanics. Ideally we're looking to stack multiple positions in the same direction and hold for days or weeks. Happy holidays everyone.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yes mate, no right or wrong, I know a few traders who want instant momentum or get out and probe again.... good luck for 2014, hope people respect the thread and don't start trying to 'filter out losses'

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hello, How do you define "engulfing"? There sometimes is confusion about this. Also, point 1 to 7 are relatively simple. But how do you use weekly S/R levels? This is not clear. If you only buy 4hrs or 1 hr engulfing bars on "up" days, how do you define "day". Days on my charts starts at 19:00EST. What if i get an engulfing 4hre candle at 23:00? I clearly don t have any data on the "new" day as it just started on my chart. Does this still qualify? How do you get to the 50% chance of success based on 2:1RR ratio. On past experience? On backtesting? Thanks, Regards. Insider

--- 帖子 #10 ---
1. Open and close engulfs previous open and close 2. Simplicity is the point. You use the weekly levels the same way any other S/R levels are used. Watch to see if and how price reacts around it, and act accordingly. The reasoning behind using only monthly, weekly, daily previous high/low is because there's no guesswork involved. There's nothing subjective about them, and they're basically the same for everyone. They are significant levels to know and help orient yourself in a longer term trend. 3. I've seen this debate over and over in this forum. My short answer: it does not matter. An engulfing bar is an engulfing bar is an engulfing bar, no matter what timezone or chart you are using. It will not make a blip of difference in the long run. 4. I'm saying those are the baseline numbers to shoot for. Like 60mm said, you don't need a 90% win rate. All you need to make money is a slight edge above 50% with 2:1RR. Anything above that just adds to the profits.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
AP3, Thanks for the reply but... 3- An engulfing bar is an engulfing bar. Fine. But what about your # 1 and 2 points in your opening post? You say: "only buy on an up day". How do I know it is an up day if the day has just started? Or maybe I should use the weekly chart in that case? Sorry if it is the same question, but i would like to understand.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Is there an engulfing bar? Did that engulfing bar close up or down relative to your daily open? It is that simple.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
ok. Thanks. So basically what you are saying is: buy/sell any 4hre engulfing bar at the break of the high/low of such a bar. Don t buy into resistance and dont sell into support. One more question. Say you have a stop order at an X price. How long before you abort the potential trade? (If it is not triggered, obviously) Insider

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Yes, that is basically what I'm saying. No need to over-think things. All we need to do is nudge the 50% probability in our favor. We do so by going with the direction of the daily flow, waiting for a strong momentum signal, and a break of that signal in the same direction. That's it, that's all. The rest are details. Good question. The trade must trigger on the next candle after the engulfing bar, or it is cancelled. But, a clean 2-bar engulfing works too.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I like it. The indicator is a bit cluttered, unfortunately I don't have the skills to amend it, but it overall it looks good and I expect it work over the long term

--- 帖子 #16 ---
You don't 'need' the indicator. These levels are easily identifiable and require no discretion. They take but a few minutes to go through and draw them for multiple pairs. In fact, if you consider yourself newer in the game, I would strongly suggest you do manually draw them for awhile. This will greatly focus your attention on the overall big picture, and put your signals into better context. You will start to internalize and see price in relation to the bigger picture, and signals in relation to price. Then after awhile you won't need to draw them anymore, and you will just trade them second nature. But yes, I agree, it is a very cluttered indi from the start. Here's what I did: 1. Turn previous monthly, weekly, daily high/low to TRUE, pick your colors 2. Turn everything else to FALSE, and all other colors black (or whatever color background your chart is) 3. Turn 'Count Days' to 1, to de-clutter

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I actually used to draw these levels on myself, and wait for PA confirmation at those levels before entering - it was a good strategy but unfortunately I can't be around my computer to wait for PA confirmation any more. I like the indicator generally, and think having the count back for 3 days is a good thing. It might just be my eye (I'm getting older), but I have a hard time pick out the lines with the writing and colours placed as they are. Will play around with settings as you suggest. Good addition to my indicator list, cheers.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
how do you consider an Up or Down day? close to close basis or breaking the previous high/low? sorry for my noobish question. &gt;.&lt;

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Please see Post #12. Up or down relative to the day's open. But, if price is above previous day's high AND above daily open, that is extra confirmation of direction. Or the opposite, below yesterday's low AND below daily open.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Yes, that's exactly the way I view a trade. As a little probe, an experiment, a seed. A single trade is not a win or lose situation. The win or lose situation is your bottom line at the end of the week, month, and year. Thank you for the kind words and same to you.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
hi Ap3 , Just started reading ur thread and indeed it is simple and easy to follow...i was looking at Eur/Usd on 1hr chart and wanted to clarify a few things if u could spare me a few minutes.....i managed to find a bullish Engulfing bar breaking the previous daily high(marked with an arrow), price was above daily open and above 50ema, i thought of entering long on the retest bar which happened to be the next bar...could please have a look and advice me if i am doing something wrong.....chart attached Regards Dennis

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I'm personally not trading until the new year or when things start to pick up. Volume is thin and price action mostly choppy. I don't trust any signals this time of year. But yes, that is essentially what to look for. That could've been a potential signal to add to the 'stack.' Price was above daily open and broke previous day's high. That is a good sign for more upward directional bias. A couple things to take into account: 1. The size of the signal engulfing bar in relation to the engulfing bars around it. Is the signal engulf significantly smaller than some of the recent engulfs? Is it significantly bigger? In general, are the upward engulfs bigger than the downward engulfs? Do upward engulfs outnumber downward engulfs? The other way around? (Ask yourselves these questions) 2. It is not wise to blindly take all H1 engulfs (not implying you did). What is happening on the H4 and D1 chart in relation to the H1? Also, you mentioned a 50ema. Is that something you like to trade or are adding as a filter? This strategy uses no indicators and no MAs. Attached Image (click to enlarge) From the screen shot, you could've potentially added two positions to your long stack, noted by yellow arrows. The first signal was a little iffy, the second much more dominant. This is what I mean by the size of the signal compared to the recent rest. Price shot up a bit after the second signal. The yellow horizontal lines indicate potential stop areas, one more conservative than the other. But with all that said, in my personal opinion I would not trade over the holidays. Enjoy your free time, family, and friends. Plus, it's always good to take a break from trading and the screens every now and then. You come back with fresh eyes and renewed inspiration. Some of my best trading and most memorable insights have come after taking a couple weeks off, or even a couple months.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Ap3, Thank you heaps for the reply...yes the second signal looked much better with more confirmation in terms of the size of the engulf...i just use the EMA to look for trend...if price is above it then i look for buys and opposite for sells....at times it does get choppy so i try to stay out but as u have said the highs and lows r more than enough...i will definitely look for the size of engulfs in the surrounding area and also the direction of the engulfs....i did not know much about stacking as i am new but yeh its a good way to maximise profits...i am learning slowly and i am looking forward to ur posts and ur guidance. Once again thank you for taking ur time out to help out.. Regards Dennis

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Stacking is a key component to the strategy for maximizing profits when price really starts trending. You can never really 'know' which signals will turn out to be homeruns and which will be duds. The best we can do is put ourselves on the right side of the probabilities. Stacking will increase profits exponentially when things are going well, and it will give you confidence through a string of losers. First, start to break yourself away from the 'one trade in, one trade out' mindset. Start thinking in terms of 'multiple trades in, all out at once.'

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is a perfect visual example of how stacking works, and should've been the screenshot used in post 1. In the last 2-3 days there were potentially 5 stacking signals on the GJ H1 chart so far. All signals triggered above their respective daily opens, and all triggered on the next candle. The only exception is signal #3, which I would consider more of a 2-bar engulf pattern (the yellow arrow being on bar 2). Price has also recently broken its previous weekly high, while also breaking previous day's high at least the last 3 days in a row. Both are excellent indications of further upward bias. Take note of the Multi-meter in the top right corner. H1 through MN1 are all up relative to their current opens. If you had taken any or all of these signals, there would be absolutely no reason to exit any of them at this point. Quite the opposite. You'd be looking to stack as many valid positions in this direction as you can, until the market proves your positions wrong. You are also looking to do this on the H4 chart at the same time, in the same direction. Stack H4 and H1 together. Be more selective on the H1 signals. As mentioned before, I personally don't recommend trading over the holidays.

hi Ap3, i was going through the aud/usd 4 hr chart and identified a bullish engulfing bar which was in the direction of the trend but it did not really work out....i was just trying a paper trade as u mentioned that its not a very gd time to place trades...it did break the open day price and as stated was in the direction of the trend....could u please have a look....i have attached the chart... regards dennis

IMO The trade you marked with a red arrow didn't trigger on the next candle so you need to delete it. Just my 2 cents

nice post AP3! and glad it attracted 60mm's attention Happy new years to you both! I like this strategy as much as I like 60mm's, and I would say you got some additional seasoning, stacking while moving existing positions to BE, very similar to pipsEASY's idea in his great thread, Building an equity millipede , http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=245149 I have a very similar strategy, good to see like minded traders around.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Ap3, do you exit all trades in case of opposite engulfing ? I think I saw this rule somewhere in one of your posts but can't find it now !!!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks tmg, that's a big help. I'm all for de-cluttering the charts as much as possible.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
The original screenshot example in the first post had an engulfing bar exit, but that was just coincidence. I edited the example to show how stacking works. Exits do not have to be engulfing bars in the opposite direction. Just make sure you're not taking profit anything below 2:1RR. There should only be three potential results to a trade. Stop out, flat, or 2:1RR and above.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hey Ap3, What pairs will we trade? Just majors or also cross pairs?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Trade whatever pairs you want. Doesn't matter the chart, these signals 'mean' the same thing. A dominant H4 engulf means that for essentially half of a trading session, one side completely swallowed previous price action in the opposite direction. This carries weight. This is why anything below H1 is irrelevant. Team that with directional bias (above or below previous monthly, weekly, daily high/low), and you're in business.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Fine ... thank you.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Here is a more detailed look at stacking. Entries and exits were rounded to the nearest 5 pips for example's sake. All signals closed up on their respective days, and all triggered on the next bar. There would be no reason to exit any of these positions yet. Although this move happened over the holiday period, these patterns repeat themselves over and over and over again. Of course, you're not going to get a stacking opportunity like this on every single engulfing bar that goes with the daily trend. Some will be stopped out. Some will be flatted. This is just an example of what it's supposed to look like when you're doing it right. Ultimately the market will decide the frequency and length of the signals. The best we can do is consistently be on the right side of the probabilities. One very important thing to note. Take into context the 'playing field' in which these signals came into being. Price had recently broken its previous monthly high, and then consecutively broke previous weekly high two times in a row. Look at the candle that broke monthly high: solid. The candle that broke weekly high the first time: dominant. The candle that broke weekly high the second time: dominant. This market is screaming long at the moment. Context has a huge impact on how a single engulfing bar can be interpreted. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

it can be applied with 30m TF too?

Nope, H1 and up only please.

Hi AP3, I just needed some advice on the Gbp/Cad 4hr trade....the trend was down on 4hr and daily time frame, the size of the bearish engulfing candle was also significant and it also closed below the daily open and the previous monthly high...the trade was triggered on the next candle but it was a big loser...couls u please have a look and advice how i could have stayed out of this 1. Chart attached Regards Dennis

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I like your thread, method of trading and rules. This is very similar to the way I trade. I wish you all the best with your thread and I will be following with interest.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
AP3, As relation to post #22-1, would you be kind enough to clarify a bit. What do you mean by size of the engulfing bars? Could you you give us a few examples of "good" and not so good setups. Thanks, Insider

--- 帖子 #47 ---
My answer is multifaceted, but I will try to keep each one as simple as possible. 1. This has already been mentioned multiple times so far in the thread, but I will elaborate. The market is in holiday season. Big players are on the sidelines. Volume is thin. Price action is prone to choppiness and unprovoked spikes. Just because volume is thin doesn't mean the market won't move. It just means that the 'implications' behind such moves are far less significant because there are significantly less participants in the market. 2. There were two comments in your post that threw up red flags in my head concerning losing. The first was that the signal turned out to be a 'big loser.' This implies that you have no control over how much you risk on any single trade. Obviously this is not true. Regardless of how many pips the signal candle is or how wide your stop, you ALWAYS have control over percentage loss. Whether your stop is 10 pips or 100 pips, risk the same amount of capital per trade. All 'losers' will be equal. The second comment was about how to 'avoid this loss.' Let's get one thing straight people. You can't 'avoid' losses. Accept this fact. Make peace with it. Look forward to it. I look forward to my losses. Want to know why? Because I know they are so small compared to the winners that they don't make a difference in the long run. Small losses are easily recoverable. Remember the 50%/2:1RR baseline. You can lose half the time and still make money. Contemplate this idea for awhile. Losses are inevitable. It is your job as a trader to limit them. 3. Were the H4 and D1 in downtrends?

Thank you smikester, your comments are much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks for the reply AP3....i try to set profit at 2:1 ratio and the stop loss at the previous swing high or low...so in terms of pips it depends on the size of the swing or the size of the engulfing candle...so my stop loss is always different..please advice if im missing somethg

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Different SLs doesn't mean that your loss will be different. That's why you must adjust your lot size to fit your risk. You must define your lot size so doesn't mater if your SL is 10 pips or 100 pips ... your loss in $ will always be the same.

Thanks kingcrab, same to you. Look forward to your participation.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
One more thing to add. Don't set your take profit at 2:1RR. I set stops but no take profits. Remember, 2:1RR is the BARE MINIMUM you should be taking on profitable trades. Let the market go past your 2:1RR point a little ways, then move your stop to 2:1RR. Never willingly take yourself out of the market when you are in profit. Keep moving your stops, and let the market prove your positions wrong.

If you prefer, stacking can also be done on D1 charts. Again, all numbers were rounded to the nearest 5 pips for ease of example's sake. Same concept as H4 and H1. No reason to stop stacking until you get a trade that fully stops you out (and even then you don't necessarily have to exit all positions). Then it might be time to reassess direction. But otherwise, don't try and predict how far the market will go. Just keep following it until it shows you differently. The purple lines on the chart = Previous weekly high/lows The gray lines on the chart = Previous monthly high/lows For D1 charts, your directional bias is up or down on the week. Only buy daily engulfs if price is up on the week. Only sell daily engulfs if price is down on the week. You can see in the chart example, all entries opened down relative to weekly opens, and all triggered on the next candle. The only exception is the 2-bar engulf entry. In this example, all positions were exited after the first loss in the direction of stacking. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

hi Ap3, yeh i am learning ur method...it takes some time to absorb all the infobut i am willing to learn...i am now mostly looking at weekly and mothly highs and lows and how price breaks them i.e if it is dominant or no...also i am looking at the size of engulfers and its position...the big issue i get or where i hesitate to pull the trigger is i am not really able to clearly confirm if the trend is up or down on the higer time frames...i mean that is really important part of this method...yeh i will definitely just set stop loss and try to extract as much profit as possible once i am able to clearly identify a trend.

hello .. to all, a good year 2014. As I am also a follower of the 60 minuteman system, I will follow this thread too. I'll put here a new version of the indicator, as I put not need to make changes in the parameters, do not mean who can not make any more changes. Only I place an easier version for this system. Thanks for sharing with us AP3 greetings, JVBS

Hey AP3 I really love your method. Pure price action. I'm wondering is it possible to use other candlestick reversal pattern other than engulfing bars such as pinbar, hammer, doji etc?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thank you JVBS.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I certainly encourage you to try if that's something you're curious about. Plenty of ways to make money in this market. Just not here, please. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Another useful tool to locate trending pairs is looking at average daily ranges. Pairs with the highest average daily ranges, and also pairs with increasing average daily ranges, are good indications of potential trending opportunities. Increasing average daily ranges signal that price has been consistently pushing outside previous day's range. There are two conclusions you can get from this. One, price action is literally 'ranging' bigger than previous days, breaking both previous day's high AND low consistently (less likely). Typically when ranges occur price action squeezes together. Price does not typically expand while staying horizontal. Or two, price action is starting to find direction and consistently breaking highs OR lows in one direction, but not both (more likely). Bottom line though, this is unnecessary to the strategy. You can trade perfectly fine without it. It's just a little extra tool for all you 'filter' junkies. In the end, the candles themselves tell all.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi AP3, great thread! In your earlier post, why wasn't the engulf (i've circled in red) valid? Apologies in advance for any confusion on my part

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi .., is a engolfo, only the forex was good that everything worked as we want, but it is not always so. it behooves every move do what he wants, we must always try for the odds on our side. How AP3 says there will be winners and losers trades, it is necessary to get at least 50% win in our favor with 2:1 R / R so that our profits will increase from day to day. Just my thoughts, I hope you understand what I mean. JVBS

--- 帖子 #69 ---
AP3, thanks for your effort on writing this thread. I have been trading like this with only minor differences for some time. From my experience there is nothing wrong with the method, and properly executed you can get a nicely growing equity curve. But why does everyone in the thread say that at a 2:1 R/R one would need a higher than 50% win ratio? You only need a higher than 33% win ratio at 2:1 R/R. 40% would be profitable. 45% would be too. 50% is actually very good, compared to traders that I know (and not easy to do at all). If the trader is good enough to pull off a higher than 2:1 R/R, such as 3:1 or 4:1, even a much lower win ratio would still grow the equity curve. Ok enough about this. Awesome thread. Keep up the awesome.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi everyone, first thanks to Ap3 for this simply approach on trending markets, it seems very powerful when combined with other markets trending techniques. One thing I'd like to ask, when we are in a loss situation (a reversal on the trend) do you stick with it until it hits SL or do you breakeven as soon as you can and void the trade?

You are absolutely right Hong Long. I'm just trying to get people to think in more simplistic terms and not focus so much on a high win rate. And also I think it's important to think in terms of probabilities, and not get so caught up on why a few trades here and there didn't work out. There is a tendency in trading and on this forum to grossly over-complicate things. The longer I trade the more I find the opposite is true. Simplistic strategies and philosophies rule. I was once an active daytrader with multiple monitors and indi's and MA's plastered all over my charts...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I would wait at least until 1:1RR to move stop to break-even. You can wait longer. But you have to give your trade some breathing room to get going. If you're moving your stop the second you get some profit under your belt, I'm going to guess you weren't that confident with the trade to begin with.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
There is no confusion on your part whatsoever. You have a good eye. It was a perfectly valid signal, and a strong one at that. It just didn't work out. But that particular example was to show how stacking works. And you can't start a stack on a loss.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Many thanks, AP3. Understood. Entered my first trade using your strat yesterday on UJ (hourly), which hung together overnight and may well give a stack opportunity within the next hour. What you have presented and shared here is fantastic! Thank you. Edit: As trade has now hit 1:1 SL moved to just above the last swing high so risk now just 12 pips.

That's a very nice entry and pretty much textbook. You could've also potentially added to the stack on the following 2-bar engulf. Good work. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Here is an odd situation that doesn't happen very often, but it's worth a mention. It came up around the start of Friday. Price was recently trending down on H4 and H1 toward and through previous weekly low. I was hunting shorts. Decent enough engulfing bar presented itself. Then it didn't trigger on the next candle. It was an inside bar. Then another inside bar. The trade triggered on the third candle after the signal engulf. On the surface this would be breaking the rules. However, inside bars directly following signal engulfs are not counted as failed trigger candles. This is because inside bars indicate price is only either resting or unsure of direction. In either case, your potential position has not been disproven, at least not at the point of the inside bars. Price has not retraced against the signal engulf. It is only pausing at this point. Therefore, if price continues in the same direction as the signal engulf, after the inside bar, you want to be on that train. So get on. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I want to take this trade as an example to ask you a couple of questions: 1) When an engulfing bar occurs with the higher TF trend, we don't cancel the pending order until price touch the other side of the engulfing bar (in this case the high)? 2) If price brake the low of the bearish engulfing, but don't trigger our order can we let the pending order or we need to cancel it?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
The trade must trigger on the next candle after the signal engulf. The only exception is a tiny inside bar that doesn't go anywhere.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hello Ap3, Thanks for posting a very nice and easy system. I have made some visual backtest and must say that the system really works, especially on 4-hour chart. Still, I have one doubt. When trading it from H4 charts, we have really very few false entries. At the same time some engulfing candles have long wicks. So, my question is: what if we enter right away at new candle open instead of setting pending order above the wick? I have not made proper calculations but it seems to me that this way we would save more pips long term than we lose by our false entries. And, of course, when making entries more aggressive, we should balance it with some additional rules. No trade if engulfing candle is longer than 2*ATR. Stoploss set to BE when three candles are above/under the entry line without touching it. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Visually backtesting this seems great on market trends, problem is as always on ranging periods. But maybe this is where MM plays it role, with a 40% win rate we could still profit using a 1:2 RR. AP3, do you have some numbers on backtest? Also, how many markets do you usually trade? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I apologize, I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the post. You said you had one doubt, then went on to say there are very few false entries. Could you clarify please?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Bingo. The winners will make up multiple times what a few losses during ranging periods will bring. I do not backtest, this is the way I trade. This isn't some system I'm 'trying out.' I'll usually have 10 or less pairs on my watchlist.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Sorry, as English is not my native language it is sometimes hard to be very clearly understood My doubt was that maybe we should enter directly at new candle open, and not with pending order above/under wick. I think we will save pips this way long term.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Entering at the high/low break is obviously to save pips and avoid entry with no momentum. An engulfing is only part of the reversal indication. We also need momentum. When price break the high/low of the engulfing, that's the signal that the market is willing to go in the right direction.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Theoretically I agree but after visual backtest I would say that on H4 chart we may enter directly. The number of false entries will not increase too much. At the same time we will have more good entries that would not trigger with the pending order principle.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
That's your choice. But that wouldn't be a good idea to enter before seeing some momentum after the engulfing.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Sure but pending order is not a guarantee of anything. It is easy to notice many occasions where the pending order would trigger before price moved back to opposite direction. At the same time, with pending orders considering also wicks we miss multiple trades that would turn out to be winners. But no sense to argue theoretically, let us find everything out in real trading My intention when asking Ap3 about the matter was to make sure if he had studied and calculated the direct entry option at all.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I guess I'm trying to get to the root of your potential alteration. Is it that you doubt you'll make any money with the rules as they stand? Or are you more worried about missing out on potential wick pips? Doubt or greed, which is it?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
More win stirred up by Greed.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I just tried to ask you a question. If you have ever tried or thought to trade this system with direct entries at new candle open. As a professional trader I would never trade any system with some other person's rules anyway. In many threads it is allowed to discuss a system. Seems like this one is just an ego trip...

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Let's keep it professional, please. This is about trading and making money.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Not an ego trip at all. Mine was a serious question. Anyone can make changes to the strategy as they see fit. I knew what would happen when I decided to share this system. I will not be making any changes, however. This is the way I trade and make money. But to answer your question, FerruFX already beat me to it. It is totally your choice, but I agree we need to see confirmation of momentum following a signal engulf.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Ok, thanks, I have no intentions to mess up your thread with my ideas I stopped by mainly because any system that is based on price action and not indicators is worth attention. I guess, I already figured out how to use your main idea of trading engulfing candles in my own way. So, big thanks for posting this wonderful system!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Ap3, I have been following ur thread since it began and i am slowly getting to the finer details of the system....i entered a trade on Eur/Usd using ur system and i am still in it with some pips in the bank...it took me awhile to enter this trade but i think its good to be late then never, the price had broken the weekly low with a dominant candle...not perfect but it did close well below the weekly low line....i entered on the next candle and it seems that it may go towards the monthly low...we cannot be certain about it though as news or some big orders can just change the momentum but we can surely bank some of our profits and try to be in the trade for as long as possible.. chart attached Regards dennis

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Nice trade. I took pretty much the exact same entry, just off the H1 chart. It was actually the screenshot example in Post #81 of the double inside bar. Up just under +60 pips on that one at the moment. Stop at breakeven. Also have limit order to sell more at 1.3575 on another H1 engulf, highlighted in the below example.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hello, I am trying to get a grip on this. A little confusing, I must admit. The rules are pretty simple but in real life... I was also looking at EUR/USD. You guys are short on this pair but the weekly trend is clearly UP. Are we not suppose to look at the overall long term trend? Or just take whatever the multimeter gives us? Which takes me to the next puzzle. The monthly trnd fo this par is red (down). But the month is basically 1 day old! Same for the week. As I am writing this, my week is 4 hours old! You see what i am getting at here. When is the signal valid? Thanks Insider

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Please don't overthink this any more than it needs to be. When I put 'Simple' in the title, I meant it. If the rules are simple, so should the practice of them in real life be. At the point of entry, price had broken the past two prev day's lows in a row, followed by the two biggest candles on the chart, two dominant reds that broke and closed below prev week low (excuse the run-on). After that, there was very little bounce-back off of prev week low. That is plenty enough space and time to trade H4's and H1's. I'm not claiming this is going to be the trade of the century. Conditions were good enough to where I felt the probabilities of that particular entry were in my favor. And the entry was within the rules. That's all. So far so good. I'm not predicting where it will go from here. I will simply follow until that position is disproven. Positions will be added to the stack if it does continue down. If it doesn't, and we start getting engulfs to the long side above daily and weekly open, I will attempt to start a long stack. No predictions involved, only simple trend following. As for your second question, I'm not sure I see what you're getting at. I believe the rules are stated quite clearly. Buy and sell with D1 direction according to the open. Please correct me if I'm wrong, or if it is unclear. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I would say your first circled signal was legit. Solid 2-bar engulfing. The second circled signal isn't as great, in my opinion. Yes, it was a solid H4 candle, but the red candle that it engulfed was very small. The real body is almost nothing. For an engulfing bar to mean something, it has to engulf something meaningful. This is not a hard and fast rule but more of a 'guideline.' In general, assume S/R will be broken until it shows you otherwise. Don't be scared taking trades into S/R. If you're getting solid engulfs in that direction, just act like S/R isn't even there. However, monitor the trade closely to see how price ACTUALLY reacts. In other words, don't let potential S/R keep you from entering, just be on guard. I did end up taking the UCad long at the beginning of the week. It was a decent H1 engulf above daily open. I have not added to the stack yet. Was away and missed some signals, and I don't normally trade this pair much. It has a much smaller average daily range than other pairs. So I just bought it and let it rip for the week. My initial risk was 35 pips, about 10 pips below the H1 swing low. I have now moved stop to +100 pips (3R), just below the current H4 low and PMH. Still has some decent room to breathe at the moment. I show you this not to brag, but to show you that it's real. I have taken more losses than wins this week but am in profit overall so far. Just an example of holding positions for multiple R's instead of 1:1RR with 80% win rate. Keep in mind I'm making MINIMUM 3:1 on this trade so far. It still has about 1R of room to move, so it could potentially keep going. The red arrows are other potential stacking areas in addition to my one entry.

Great trade If only you would have posted it in live market...... Do you think you will post some live trades like this one in the future (maybe only the 4H trades)? I think it would be the best way to learn for any of us because we could see the market movements and your ideas regarding your entries... Thanks in advance for your effort.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Respectfully, I feel the best way to learn something is by doing, not watching. This strategy is simple enough and has a solid enough foundation for each trader to make small adjustments according to personal style. Not adjustments TO the rules in Post #1, but WITHIN the rules. It's like in The Matrix. Once the rules are mastered, they can be bent. I am a trader first, Forex Factory poster second. I do realize there is benefit in live trade calls. I will make an effort to post some going forward but not at the expense of my personal trading. So in the meantime, my advice for anyone interested is to just jump right in and start trading it yourself. *I'm not advocating everyone trade real money right off the bat. That is your decision and responsibility.

--- 帖子 #124 ---

Anyone long on last GBP/USD 4H? Also EUR/USD, USD/CHF and NZD/USD 4H are forming a nice engulfing

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Great thread AP3, love your style I read that you only use the engulfing pattern. Somebody proposed to use other reversal patterns, but they aren't the same .. Except for the Hammer (Bull) - Shooting star (Bear). In essence they are exactly the same .. An engulfing pattern is a price bar moving down for x pips (from open to close) and later a price bar that moves back up for x+n pips and thus engulfing the body of the first one. When we look at the Hammer that is happening too. New bar opens, price moves all the way down for x pips, but than the second move 'engulfs) the previous price movement for x+n pips, closing higher than the open .. That is why ( on 4H chart ) an engulfing pattern is often a hammer or shooting star with different brokers .. just because there is a time difference .. but they mean the same

Hey AP3, 1)when you add a 2nd position to an existing trade, do you move the 1st SL where you place the 2nd one, or you treat every position opened as stand alone? 2)When you add a 2nd positions to an existing trade, do you risk the same % of your account of the 1st one, or you reduce the size? (for example, if you risk 2% on your 1st position, do you risk 2% also in all the position you will add to the 1st one?) Hope to be clear enough with my bad english... and thanks for ur effort

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I made a personal decision concerning the above and as a follower of this thread. Here are my assumptions and logic: I assume as you say... no bullshit... that you are and have been successfully trading and making money with your SIGNALS and your rules. So.. it only makes sense... that the BEST chance of imitating YOUR success is to DO what you are DOING ... (as much as possible.. given discretion/trade choices etc.) Apart from practicing/following the relatively simple/non-subjective 'rules' you've laid out the CRITICAL next issue are the engulfing bar SIGNALS. They are essential to your success. If I asked you to start using Alpari for signals on your 'live' account.... you wouldn't. I don't blame you. Why would you SWITCH when you have something that is WORKING? You wouldn't. ►So here... take a look... vastly different 'engulfing' signals. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Is this a criticism? Is this a 'flaw' in your 'system'? No... and No. I (honestly) don't KNOW whether it will 'work' (with the same success rate) using Alpari engulfing 'signals'.... and neither do you, really. BUT I KNOW... you wouldn't change horses at this point... especially after analyzing the above charts. There's no denying they are throwing out different signals on a candle-by-candle open/close basis. So... lead on brother... took me 5 minutes to go to Onanda.... now I see what YOU see. Cheers, G.

^ I assume this is because Oanda 's day starts at midnight eastern, and Alpari is somewhere around GMT(?) - six or seven hour difference chopping up the bars. regards

Not sure why... my position is: 'I don't really care'... seriously... not interested in creating a 'problem' or fostering any detours. The 'problem' was easily solved...

For another glaring example of what I mean... here's a current closeup of EURUSD H4: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #145 ---
hey goldenequity, when a trend starts, it does not matter, just sometimes you get a better entry or a lousier entry, it just doesn't matter. you will get in and ride the trend but you will never know your chart will let you jump in earlier or later, depending on your luck (probability), so stop arguing about that as sometimes you will benefit from an early entry. if it really bothers you that much, go to 1h chart. 4H/8H/daily charts will always have this problem. I have one mentor who 'forces' his students using new york close chart, that is considering markets open at 17:00 EST. he made a good point saying that new york close marks the end of a trading day, and that 4H candle should close at the end of the day. whatever it is, just doesn't matter as you will sure win and lose some trades regardless you enter earlier or later. peace, ZXD

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Exactly, thank you zxdtrader. Your profitability is not broker-time dependent. This is not some 1 minute red-light-green-light indicator/MA cross strategy. There is actual meaning behind these moves. That's why sometimes, not always, they continue for days and weeks at a time, if not longer. Sometimes one broker will have a slightly better entry than another, and sometimes the other way around. It will all even out. You mentioned your mentor. I had a mentor that used to say, "In trend trading, entries are like horseshoes and hand grenades. If you're in the right direction, close is good enough." Goldenequity, I know you are not arguing. I know your concern has positive intentions. So are mine, but I won't spend time discussing this any longer.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Fair enuff... no argument intended let's move on.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hey guys, In my opinion, in order to make this system really NON SUBJECTIVE (as title says), we need to write strict rules also on placing Stop loss and Money management. 1)When to place SL below/above the low/high of the engulfing candle 2)When to place SL below/above the last swing low/high 3)How many % of equity relative to the first trade we have to use when we add on to a position (if we risk let's say 2% on the 1st trade, how much we have to risk on the 2nd, 3rd etc. positions opened on the same direction of the 1st) What's your opinion on this?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
These are the things you get to play around with. If it's not outlined in Post #1, for the most part just trade it to what you feel is right. Experiment a bit. Make little tweaks. As long as you already have some decent experience and discipline, and you stick to the general rules, you'll be ok. You'll learn as you go, fit it to your own style and refine that style as time goes on. Learn by doing. I think the thread is starting to go down the wrong path. There's starting to be a theme of wanting me to call live trades, change your charts to fit exactly mine, etc. The point is not to copy what I do or how exactly I trade. Everyone is different. Focus on the fact that everyone is starting with the same simple, solid foundation, which gives each trader the freedom to play with the minor details. So in general, if you trade this strategy according to the rules we should all be in the same relative direction, but each entry and exit will be different for each trader. 1. In general, I move all prior stops up to the same point, which is whatever the current entry's stop is. 2. In general, I risk the same. But this is a tricky question. Depending on the signal and surrounding price action, sometimes I increase risk, and sometimes reduce it. Also as a general rule, the more stacks you already have on the less you want to start risking. Price does not go in one direction continuously. It does pull back or reverse eventually. So I typically move all prior stacks up to the current stop. That means my first loss into a stack exits all positions in that stack. I'll generally start to look to go the other way at that point. Really depends on price action. Additionally, most of the time I'll flat a trade and still keep the current stack going. If you were holding for very long term, you could also take a loss or two and still keep a stack going. Experiment, let me know how it goes. Apologize if the answers to your two questions were a bit vague. But that's the point I think. These are the minor details that kind of change with the current conditions. I react to the market as it goes but stay within the Post #1 rules. So it's hard to answer those questions because those are the minor details that change and 'bend.' Just focus on consistently being in the right direction and stacking as many quality positions in that direction as you can. The rest you'll learn and adapt as your own.

An additional indicator used as a filter would have kept you out of some trades. Modify the system to meet your needs. btw, the last bars don't count because the move is due to NFP

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Thanks. 1) What do you mean by "an additional indicator"? Can you give some examples? 2) The last bar count because we don't have any rule like "don't trade on news events"

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Basically there are thousands of indicators and people use what they like. Going with the trend is a filter. For example you could use a couple of moving averages and trade in the direction of the moving averages, or you could use the extreme TMA Line and only trade at the edges and with the trend. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...94#post5660594 Note: The extremeTMA Line automatically adjusts to your timeframe but with many other indicators you need to adjust them to suit your timeframe. The extreme TMA has a middle line which I believe is normally disabled in the settings. You can enable it and it will be changing from green to red to give you a confirmation The same system uses another indicators called TMA slope I don't use it, but I played with it in the past. Other people use ichimoku clouds, RSI, divergence etc etc Moving your stop to break even after x number of pips could also stop you from losing some trades.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
AP3, for confirmation, uses only the open price of the daily. Above open price only buy and below only sell. I think he wouldn't add any indicator on his system other than pure price and previous high low....

Sure, with good money management you don't need anything else. I was only giving you an idea in case you wanted to experiment in your back testing. Remember that when you introduce any filter you will take less trades so you will avoid some losers but you will miss out on a few winners as well Therefore perhaps you won't improve your results because for example 3 losers @ 50 pips and 1 winner @ 150 pips = break even In fact that 1 winner could deliver 300 pips or more.... Therefore, I'd look at the losers in your back testing and see how you could avoid some of them naturally. For example by trading only during certain times of the day or by avoiding big news events, Fridays. etc etc Using a different broker with different chart time will give you different 4H candles and different results as well

Does anyone have engulf candle indicator for mt4 that covers open close only as per rules of this thread. Many thanks, there are a lot on various sites but none that just cover open/close. Geoff

Hi Ap3, and thanks for the thread, and the information you are sharing with us. I am enjoying learning to try your system. I would like to comment on two things. 1. If this system (as presented) has been profitable to you, I am hoping that we can practice it and learn it 'as is'. Ii really hope that this thread does not fizzle away because we are trying to add, change or modify it. 2. do you think it is possible to use the same system on different time frames? Have you had any experience with it? and what are thoughts on it. I am finding that I am not able to follow trades on the 4h tf. Thanks Ezzy

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I beg to differ. The success is not a result of a magical signal, it is a result of a sound approach. The engulfing patters are not working because of their appearance, they are working because of what they are indicating (a possible reversal with momentum in the current market action that is also in line with the current direction of the bigger time-frame) and, most importantly , because of the way these opportunities are traded. It is the stacking and the allowed growth that are essential, not the signals. You can trade inside bars in similar fashion (remember Profitable Trend Trading?), you can trade pins, you can trade whatever works for you. But it won't be the signal that makes your 'system' profitable. It would be the trading approach. I would recommend you (and anyone still looking for the 'perfect' signal that would finally give them the system they are looking for) to read Building Equity Millipede thread here on FF. Then come back to this thread and just read the rules. It would be obvious that it would work and why. It would be obvious that your chart provider does not matter in the long run. That being said, Ap3 still deserves full credit for presenting his trading approach here. Knowing the principles is one thing, successfully applying them - something different. He took the time to build a strategy around a simple enough signal that anyone can follow and he's presenting it here for free. I hope he does not feel offended in any way by what I am saying here. I do not intend to belittle his contribution but merely to dispel a misunderstanding. Best regards, Barbossa

*** 1. Don't add indicators. No major changes to the rules. Make changes to yourself and refine your skills at 'reading' the market. If it were 100% objective it would be an EA. We can't eliminate subjectivity altogether, or at least I don't want to. So let's say hypothetically a strategy is 95% objective, 5% subjective. That 5% is small, but it is crucial to the entire game. It is like the keystone in an arch holding everything together. This is why you will see traders having a spectrum of different entries and profitabilities all trading the same rules. This is why a beginner will make a profitable system fail. This is why this strategy MIGHT not work for you. It's not for everyone. 2. Are you wanting to go higher or lower? Daily signals are perfectly fine. Even if you don't enter them, it is still wise to take note of them. I don't see why weekly wouldn't work but don't have much experience entering them. Again, take note even if you don't enter off it. I haven't even glanced at a chart below H1 in probably a few weeks. *** Obviously you can do whatever you want with this strategy. Add as many indicators as your heart desires. Pick and choose rules. I'm just asking you do it somewhere else.

Hi Ap3, thanks for comments. Perhaps you misunderstood my post, I certainly don't want to add more indicators to a winning strategy, and I hope others don't start posting any here either. Up or down it doesn't matter, 4h is hard for me to follow (Due to the time I can and can not keep an eye on the charts) . I presume entries on a daily candle are going to be much better than in 15 min . Thanks Ezzy

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I wasn't implying you personally were going to. That was my advice to everyone about your concerns for the thread. Daily entries will be just fine according to the same rules in Post #1. There just won't be as many entry, and therefore stacking, opportunities as trading H4 and H1. But D1 engulfs are more meaningful. What D1 lacks in numbers it makes up for in quality. You could also increase the amount of pairs or markets you look at if you find it is TOO slow of a trading style. In the case of daily entries, buy above weekly open, and sell below weekly open. Everything else is the same. For weekly entries, buy above monthly open, and sell below monthly open.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
OK, here's another example from me: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Three consecutive engulfing patterns, four if you consider the continuation bar that engulfs the small pause bar. All engulfs close below the open price of the day they happen. The first one does not trigger a trade, however it still serves as indication, adding weight to the downside bias.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Sorry re the long quote, was hoping it would include the screenshot too. Things to consider: 1. Premise is basically sound: add to winning positions 2. Needs a filter such as only open a second position once P1 is at 1:1 and breakeven otherwise sideways choppy markets will result in you opening opening opening and closing them all at a loss, which is not what you want to do - see EU maybe yesterday. 3. Your chart shows opening during DEC25 - er no, no idea how you got that on your chart, the markets weren't open. 4. You show entries during all market sessions - this is untradeable by a human being that unfortunately has to eat, sleep and have a life, probably go to work etc. 5. Same with the trade management - you can't just look every hour and see if 1:1 etc has been reached as those levels are not going to tick in a mechanical fashion like that, which means screen watching 24/7 6. Which brings us to 6, which is if it's totally mechanical with no discreation an EA could trade it, Caveat: ALL EAs lose money without fail, ergo discretion IS involved.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
nunrgguy, if I may add some thoughts on your comment: 4. Setups exist during all sessions (on a side note - I would be VERY suspicious if they didn't). This does not imply you need to take all of them. Hence, there's absolutely no problem to trade in this manner. 5. Same with the trade management - there's no need to move the stops at the exact moment the price hit 1:1 or some other level. Open the platform, check positions. Did the price actually reach your milestone? Yes? Then manage the positions. Unless the price moved back past your intended stop-loss level. In this case, just leave it. Totally doable. Oh, and it won't hinder your performance. If anything, missing some opportunities will actually reduce your losses. Granted, you WILL miss some good entries as well, but overall your results will be about the same, if not better. Plus, you don't get to monitor the markets 24/7, so you will not be nearly as stressed as if you want to catch each and every setup out there.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
AP3, I don t know if this has been talked about before. I don t recall reading anything about it. Say the trend is clearly up. So we are looking for buys on the 1 hre chart. There is a short pullback of not one, but TWO down bars of say, medium size. If the next bar is engulfing only the second of the down (red) bars, is it a valid signal? Or does it have to engulf BOTH of the previous down bars? Thanks. Insider

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Just adding some debate - I'm not saying the idea is 'wrong' AT ALL btw , only trading above or below the open is as old as the hills and a standard method of the fellow whos indicator has been renamed for some reason. But common sense prevails.

OK, there's some confusion here I feel - in post one it says you're going to trade with both the daily and weekly trend: "The goal is to stack H1 and H4 positions in the direction of the daily and weekly trend" but then only mentions trading above/below the daily open in the checklist. Now, how are you defining trend - also above/below the weekly open? Because, if so, on your gold example the OBs in some of those red boxes are from the weekly high, above the weekly open and back into the open i.e. if you're entering with weekly direction they're not entries, the later one you've marked would be: could you clarify on daily and weekly open please? Ta Also, if it's none subjective the rules/checklist need to be crystal clear. Another example if you like - you say one of the gold bars did not trigger: I don't know this is subjective: with a 1 pip past bar trigger on a past bid chart there really is no idea if the ask hit that trigger or not. The stop placement is subjective too (10 pips below the bar or previous swing low I think you said) - so there's a choice, also dependent on timeframe being observed H1 or H4? Stop below previous H4 swing, or stop below previous H4 bar or previous H1 swing?: it's subjective. And then you said something like (going from memory) that after 3:1 I think it was trail your stop as you see fit - OK, again that's subjective.And again re being prudent not buying selling into certain lines - subjective at point of entry, no hard and fast rule. I'm just stating all this as it is early days for the thread which has in its title 'none subjective' and yet it is anything but. You also state that things will play out long term and that certain near term criterion will average out: blanket statement and opinion presented as fact unless you have data to back it up. Also helps if the two losing trades from the day before are noted: not getting on your case but don't, please, at this early stage start cherry picking

Hi jvbs , Do u mostly take trades off the hourly time frame..its good to see u doing well...i think Ap3 also talks about the size of the engulfers in one of the posts...i mean the engulfing candle should engulf a decent size candle or bar..4hr charts tend to give better signal i think but it depends since u have stated that at times ur too busy with work...i just wanted to know how u set profit targets, i have just set up a micro account and kind of not really looking to let trades run but wana take decent profits so that i can build profits and then trade a bit bigger. Regards Dennis

--- 帖子 #198 ---
What I'm going to say is only my view, so don't take it as "part of the system". It might be, or it might not be. Also, pardon me if your questions were not targeted at me, but I got that impression since you quoted my post. For me, the weekly trend is my target, not my guideline. I intend to enter from H1/H4 in the daily direction (that is - buys above the daily open, sells below it). I'm not trying to predict the weekly trend, I'm looking for opportunities to join it, sometimes at the very start of the movement. It is subjective, I agree. On the Gold chart I posted, I saw enough reason for me to try an entry. Upwards movement has stalled and sellers have pushed down a number of times. This may or may not lead to a downward move - I don't know before it happens. But if it happens, I want to be already in. Again, that's only my take. If you don't feel comfortable trading against the weekly, then by all means don't do it. You can apply the same 'buy above open, sell below it' rule to the weekly candle as well. It's up to you. It's a subjectivity that can't be avoided, because you need to be comfortable with your trades. You need to trust your trades. And we all have different views, different comfort zones, etc. On your question about triggering a trade - the author recommended using a 10-pip buffer for the pending orders. While this aims to catch only the moves that happen with momentum, it also serves to protect you from 'invalid' fills, unless your spread is bigger than 10 pips. If that is the case, you can simply extend the buffer, or change broker. About the stops - the stops are a bit subjective as well, for the same reason. However, in my opinion you should always use the time-frame that provides the setup/entry as a source for the stop placement. The reason is that H1 has 4 times as many bars as H4 does. That means (on average) 4 times as many setups. While you don't take them all, you'll still end up taking more entries than you would if you traded H4. If you used H4 to place your stops, the result would be exactly the same as if you simply placed more trades (on other words - if you overtraded) on the H4. Your losses would grow significantly, while your profits would remain about the same.

Still short UJ but stop now at b/e.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi Barbossa. That really doesn't make sense and I'll tell you why: The first post says in the direction of the daily AND the weekly 'trend'. It defines trend by above or below the open. The issue is then compounded by as you say joining on the hourly or the 4 hourly - are you sticking to just one of these or using both because if using both you have another issue. i.e. you see a large bar on H4 close above the daily open, you go long. Now you only have 20 hours, maximum for that to play out before the new day starts, in that time all you've see on H4 is inside bars, then there's an outside bar below the daily open the next day - unless the weekly open is there as a filter it's not going to work. Also as I mentioned too if you're going to use both H1 and H4, you'll often end up opening an H1 trade, just about getting it to BE, then see an H4 OB, open again, with a stop further away than your B/E - in terms of market movement this is illogical. Big bars often have pullback to the area of near term s/d and if you entered on the H1 and it does so I can almost guarantee it will stop out, so you're not 'stacking' at all. Re entry fills - the OP does not say to use a 10 pips buffer on entries at all - he says to use a 1 pip buffer, 10 pips is the additional buffer on your stop. Therefore, hindsight charts, which the thread will have plenty of, showing entries which weren't hit, will be, frankly BS. Iin your post above you say, paraphrasing, joining the weekly trend before it happens: I think you need to define trend here because I'm sure the people who were long above the weekly open and are still holding would imagine that trend is up and it already happened. Or is trend now being defined by a larger timescale and a trendline? In which case say in the case of gold, it's been up for 3 weeks including this week, also with an OB in the weekly so shorts above the weekly open are a short term retrace play, with the probability of them turning into a trend being fairly low (this is purely opinion of course ). If you're not planning on holding over the weekend, with this kind of method you've 2 options and 2 options only - breakout from the open (with the trend), or retrace from the extreme, back towards the open, that's it. There is no trend. Whic is why I say what is your definition of trend if the open is the reference.? Also re the gold trade - OK. So you weren't already long from before and holding those trades? If you regularly trade that market...why not? There's a few other areas in previous posts where opinion on results is being stated as fact, when it is PURELY opinion with no way of backing it up without knowing how certain trades were managed and what the outcome was.... LOL. All I'm saying is that the entire thing IS subjective and is being presented as not: even the rules (as is usual on FF) are not crystal clear.

Hi Ap3 and all, This is great! my main focus for the last few months has been learning price action trading with minimum 'clutter', this system is a perfect compliment to what I do already, I already opened a new trial account and set up the charts, looking forward to stacking some good positions with it. Nice to see lots of enthusiasm to, trading is a serious business but you've gotta enjoy it as well. 'Donk.

hi nasko, yes, I am a follower of Mr pipsEASY's millipede thread. there are definitely jewels in FF, those have the patience and desire, will find them, and they are all free. I paid some hundreds of dollars to subscribe to a commercial site to learn its price action strategy, found out only inside bars, pin bars and fake breakouts, no engulfing bars, and it's not allowed to discuss engulfing bars on its community forum. if I could have found all these good threads in FF, I wouldn't waste a few hundreds. never mind though, my point is, these free stuffs can definitely make money and the OP should be respected for sharing. have a good day ahead BR, ZXD

I recently found this thread and I'm still reading through it, I'll be sticking around if there's some life in the thread. Been trading for 3 years, recently with a modestly successful method (TMS system on this site) have been increasingly coming to the view that price action is the way to go and this thread/method looks a nice way to develop PA skills. I'll be posting charts when I have some interesting trades and if there's anyone around.

Also agree this is a promising thread and I hope Ap3 decides to stick around, he's been away for a week or 2. I have been using what I call a 3 bar reversal, Ap3 calls a 2 bar engulf, for some time to good effect. Whilst getting decent trades the stacking concept is something I have to significantly improve on. Anyway cheers Ap3.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi zxdtrader, totally agreed! Mr pipsEASY's method is the nicest thing I have seen on FF and I have been keeping an eye here since 2006. Combined with engulfing, it does really beats the odds! Therefore, what better thing than sticking to this. Are you guys in some long/short trades? I believe we are going to see great momentum in the CAD-pairs and this might be just the beginning of a new trend- but who knows . Also- GBP/USD might be suitable for some long entries in the coming days/weeks... Any thoughts on the pairs that u r currently trading? Chrz, Nasko

I am obsessed with EURAUD and AUDUSD of late as they trend so well. In EURAUD from 1.5391 and instead of adding with the last 1hr engulf exited two thirds at +100. Reason being 1.5500 is a key level. The whole stacking thing is the issue I have to work on.

one of the best trending pair is GBP/CAD at the moment I think. there are also a number of entries this week for GBP/USD. I actually trade slightly different, but the concept is very similar to AP3's. I will always wait for a daily engulfing first, then start from the next day, I will seek 4H engulfing/inside bar entries in the daily direction. the seeking will not stop until a reverse daily engulfing happens, will exit all positions if reverse 4H engulfing happens after that. in fact, this can be the time to trade in the opposite direction, but for the sake of following the trend in the bigger time frame, counter trend trading is not encouraged. then here comes the great idea from 60mm in his H4 power thread, once daily engulfing happens, price will seek S/R from the weekly S/R levels, the nearest dominant weekly high/low/open/close could be good reference to look for PA, by dominant I mean, solid body &amp; in the trend direction. I don't use the following small body weekly bars as reference as they are all closed within the range of the dominant weekly S/Rs. and from there, I have more confidence to either rejoin the trend, if price bounce off the dominant weekly S/R level, or if price close out of the S/R level in the reverse direction, which indicates a reverse weekly engulfing happens, then the dominant monthly S/R level will be referenced. on top of that, Mr. pipsEASY's &amp; AP3's stacking rules applies. I am not trying to steer people away from the original Ap3's rules, nor I want to hijack this thread. I am just trying to contribute a little which I feel makes some sense.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
You can't catch all signals, but I believe the philosophy of this system is to keep on stacking positions until you are proven wrong by the market.

EA short (hrly) pending..

...filled overnight and still in the trade. Seems to be respecting the hrly swing resistance and 61.8 fib level atm...willing to hold on for now unless there's an hrly close above the 61.8 retrace....as who knows, a 3rd leg/wave down could be unfolding.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi sidefx, we are probably about to see a bearish engulfing by the end of this hour- 8 GMT (EA). Being just close to previous weekly's low, we might see a quick break or a rebounce, but still with the bearish engulf, the possibility of a bearish continuation is stronger. Just look at the chart

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi nasko, indeed my friend. A nice hrly stacking opp earlier too..

--- 帖子 #259 ---
...if it gets there i'll take profit on this EA short around the next RN (1.5300). Edit: exit @ 1.5305 filled.

Here's a picture of H4 EURUSD. D1, W1 and M1 are all pointing downwards. Two bullish engulfing bars. Am I right to assume that both candles are no trades? [EDIT]Appears I assumed wrong (post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...76#post7174476 )

Nice one Sidefx, Hope it works out nicely .... I am still with the OIL trade and it provided another opportunity for stacking from a lower timeframe- that is just my way of trading which should not be confused with Ap3- I believe his system is great and should be followed as described. I am just using a similar one incorporating 15M timescale, as well for lower-risk opportunities- I have attached an example from today- hope this is not taken as a sign of trying to replace original system! It is just my own additional tool, which I am sharing with you guys! Cheers

Hi Sidefx, just to let you know that I am looking for a buy signal on the USD/CAD.... It doesn't mean that I am right...

Hi Nasko, i decided to exit after the spinner around recent daily lows, so just a meagre 16 pips taken I may go for the long later too if it materialises. Good Trading.

My long on this pair got stopped out last night, I had entered at 20:00 cst @1.1092 on the H4 trade. The best reason I shouldn't have taken it was a poor R/R ratio. I'm not getting this as I have lost on 3 successive H4 trades, not all US/CAD, plus deleted 2 other Stop trades that weren't going as expected but at least weren't losses. Time to reread the thread. p

..my charts printed a 4hr long engulf (USD/CAD), but I'm not in yet..

--- 帖子 #275 ---
To be honest with you, I have stopped looking at it, because I have already spotted another engulfing on AUD/USD 1H- just waiting for it to close in about 5mins. Let's see about it Chrz

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Good luck if it triggers. I'm now short UJ (hrly), nice engulfing rejection of the recent daily highs and monthly level..worth a punt

Cheers sidefx, I saw that UJ, as well- looks promising good luck to you too

Thanks sideFX, I will try to do my best to trade this style :-) - still I am in training mode. I think, that it takes a while till creating my first stack ... Cheers

Hey mate, I have missed a second stacking opportunity last night... but this one was the right one I am continuing my lookout for other BULFs and BELFs , let's see whether some will appear today...

--- 帖子 #280 ---
By the way, just looking at this one right now- the Cable 1H I have attached a chart guys, but still need a confirmation from a lower time scale to go long

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Nice call on AU nasko. I'm still in the UJ short and just entered EJ short now too, with an hrly/15min engulf setup Edit: stopped out -50.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hey guys, didn't get a confirmation signal from the Cable on a lower timescale so probably the right direction is SHORT... but I got one from Gold , hope it works nicely I have attached a chart. Bear in mind that my signal was coming from the 15M chart, although it might get confirmed by the 1H chart if I was right on this trade... let's see whether it's going to be a winner.... Chrz

Hey Sidefx, great- I missed this one, although I was looking at it and gold and wondering which one to take .. Hopefully they both work out m8 ... time will show Chrz

GU - short engulf (hrly)..NB: double engulf over the last 4 hours.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
As far as I understand the starter of this trading style - you need a trending environment to find good stacking opportunities. GU is just in a sideways move and waiting for the news to come - so there is no momentum. Also the price is meandering around the previous monthly low (PML) - no clear direction. My trading lesson: I didn't manage to build my first stack entry @ short GBPJPY - On a bigger picture it looks like a 50% retracement to me and maybe its time to begin stacking to the long side :-). Cheers &amp; Good Luck

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi nichess, I do totally agree with you, but I have said in previous posts if you are following this thread that my style of trading is really close to this system, but with some exceptions. I do not want to add anything to Ap3's system, it is really awesome, but I am just sharing with the other traders that have similar strategies my trading ideas- I don't think there is anything wrong with that . Chrz

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thank you at all to share your strategy. I have a little problem, if I tried to put the indicators in the folder indicator and if I closed and reopen the plateform, I don't see these indicators. the version I have is 4.00 build 600. anybody can help me??? Have a nice day

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi, If you put the MQ4 or EX4 files in C:\MT4 installs\H4 Std \ experts\indicators folder you should see them in the Navigator window under Custom Indicators If you don't see them there, either they are faulty, or they are not the indicators you think they are, for example Expert Advisors can look like indicators but will not work unless they are in the correct folder. Or they are accidently not in the right folder. Have fun!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
thank Gizz, I put the indicators (Daily-Weekly-Monthly hi-low.mq4 and the multiMeter.mq4 found in the fisrt page..) and I put in the expert/indicator folder anf I can not to find but with the exploror Windows, i see them....where the mistake??? thank for your help. anybody have some ides???

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi guys, I am looking at the EUR/AUD at the moment and this bullish engulfing, but still have the feeling that all patterns before the jobs data might be fakeys... anyways, I am not sure about trading this one, but thought nice of sharing with you what I am seeing right now Chrz

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Also guys, just a quick look at Gold 1H, we can see two bullish engulfing patterns in the near past, which might an indication of where the price is going to eventually lead us after the jobs data ... who dare trade before that?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I assume you use previous high/lows as resistance, because they aren't subjective. However you then continue to explain that these lines are used in a subjective manner anyway (e.g. deciding on take profit, directional bias, etc.). So why not use subjective s/r lines in the first place? To my point 9 is a bit irritating. The win ratio of a system can't be a part of the ruleset of that system. Really like the overall clarity of your ideas though. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Liberty55 If the Indi's are definitely in the correct folder and you're definitely looking in the right place to find them and we know the indicators are good, then as far as I can see there must be a fault with your MT4 install, it might be worth downloading a new one from your broker and trying it from scratch, Sorry I don't have other solution for you! Good luck.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
i think following the strategy kinda helps especially the pending order bit it helps to minimise loosers that long wick would have made the trade to be a looser had i not set a buy stop spread +1 i took this gbp/jpy trade i closed it for 1:2 RR some 81pips i dint want to hold a trade over the weekend

I am looking at the Cable right now. We MIGHT get a bullish engulfing pattern, after which I would be looking for a long entry point from a lower time scale, but let's see whether it's going to be a Bullish Engulfing first. Here is the chart of what I am seeing. Chrz

Good morning all, anybody trading crude? I have just noticed this 4H and 1H Bull Engulf, which is in the direction of the main trend... have a look Btw, are you guys trading commodities or just FX? Obviously it is a FX forum, but I wanted to check about that. Chrz

--- 帖子 #305 ---
hi nasko, major problem i have is my broker, it doesn't offer very good spread for a lot of currency pairs, so i only look at AUD/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/USD, EUR/JPY and GBP/USD most of the time, occasionally EUR/NZD, my broker offers inverse version of it NZD/EUR, with relatively cheaper spread, otherwise it's ridiculous about 15pips spread. i think those are good enough for many opportunities. I do monitor US crude oil (WTI), Gold and some indices like S&amp;P500, DOW 30, Japan, UK and Australia. now comes the perk of my broker that offers SGD (home currency) denominated contracts of the above markets. no currency conversion is needed, which is quite cool, just some of the markets require high margins. on my chart i saw US crude oil is approaching a monthly range upper boundary.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi zxdtrader, nice remark I know what you mean by higher spread- my broker is offering a 5 points spread on crude and to me it feels like it's enormous, so that is why I am not trading it that often, but considering opening another account for just trading crude. This strategy sounds great for crude

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hiya, Anybody finding good set-ups this morning? I am looking at the NZD/JPY 1h's engulfing and it looks like a pretty valid signal what do u guys think?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Wow..cool I'm sure this strategy works Simple yet effective, no doubt about it

--- 帖子 #309 ---
very likely next week GBP/USD and gold will surge higher. i am guessing.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Totally agreed! I don't know whether it is going to be next week, but they will rise for sure in the mid-long term I guess this might be a great opportunity for a millipede builder

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Just a follow-up from yesterday on NZD/JPY- The stop is still untouched and there is another bullish engulfing around the same level as yesterday, which confirms the same price action is taking place around the same price level

--- 帖子 #312 ---
every time i trade 1h, i got screwed, LOL. maybe because my time zone is in Asia, who knows. NZD/JPY daily is still up, price is trapped in the daily range, no close below 84.42. weekly shows it briefly tapped the weekly upper boundary. but i think very likely the upward movement will continue if today close above last week's high. that's my analysis on this pair, personally i don't trade it since my broker charges 5-7 pips for this pair.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi zxdtrader, try fine-tuning with another time scale. There might be a few misleading signals along the way . Otherwise, I agree with u about the NZD/JPY and as you have the conviction that the next move is up... but let's see

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thanks nasko! ya i trade 4H. the green dashed line is drawn on the daily bullish engulfing candle. subsequent days are separated by grey dashed lines, 6x 4H candles in between 2 lines. 4H bullish engulfing for entry.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Niceee! I have attached an example of another timescale, which could be used, as well. In general, the higher the time frame the better, but I have found that 15M could be quite reliable I hope the strict followers of Ap3's system do not crucifix me, but I am not trying to change the original rules, I am just showing a bit of my way of trading... just my 0.02

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi zxdtrader, indeed you can PM me, if you want me to share how I am doing my fine-tuning. I just don't want to flood this thread with other ideas. Want to stick to its original rules- I don't even want to give a hint of another system- something which I have already done, but I think I shouldn't have to. Let's stick to its original. By the way, where is Ap3- have you guys heard of him? Chrz

well i wish we can keep trying this syst its really cool when you follow the rules i took this u/j trade yestarday it took hours before hitting my TP i took 1:2 but could have gone to 1:3 am now in the e/j trade we shall see how it goes

Hi everyone As my nick-name implies I am not the brightest spark in the firmament but I choose to make this thread my first ever entry since I like the logic and simplicity behind the strategy. It is similar in many ways to Peter Crowns inside bar strategy but has the advantage of momentum behind the entries. Since the whole strategy revolves around outside bars I am a little confused as to what actually qualifies as an outside bar. The general consensus, and the description by Ap3 is 'one that opens and closes, engulfing the previous bars open and close' This is very straightforward yet I have seen numerous trades initiated from 'outside bars' that do not engulf the whole of the previous bar. Rather, many appear to engulf just the body and upper wick of the previous candle in the case of a long trade and vice versa for a short. It could therefore be argued that these are just continuation candles and as such muddies the water significantly If Ap3 is still around, or if anyone else feels qualified to advise, I would appreciate a clarification. Many thanks to anyone who can help.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Ap3's engulfing bar is one where the open and close of the bar engulfs the previous bars open and close,so not all outside bars are engulfing bars according to his definition.It's a pity that Ap3 has disappeared as I think his method has some potential,there are a few other threads that promote this style of trading.It is interesting to see that the most recent posts have ignored the original rules and have dropped down in time frames to force more trades.The original rules called for taking direction from the previous daily bar and trading a 4hr chart,now the recent posters are trading 1hr charts...evolution perhaps.

hey forex_idiot, you are far from that word in your nick i am sure. good trade by the way. as the other poster already mentioned, i felt sorry posting my own strategy in Ap3's thread even though they are very similar. nevertheless, i apologize if i have confused anyone here.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi Forex_idiot, I believe nobody is trying to change the system. I you have read all the posts you would have figured it out, that it is nobody's desire to change Ap3's system, but myself have been using a very similar system with some minor differences. I do not want to change the way people understand this system, I have been just discussing some entries here. Otherwise, Ap3's system is very easy and straightforward, so don't be confused with other people's comments. Otherwise, for the engulfing pattern, we are looking only for open/close values and not so much into high/low. But if low/high has been engulfed- even better. It is all about the psychology of the market that stands behind that. Hope this clears your mind a bit Chrz

--- 帖子 #331 ---
GBP/USD is still holding above the daily support line 1.6643 which happens also to be a swing point. still looking for a prominent 4h entry to long.

Good morning fellas, Today looks brighter than yesterday for sure GBP/NZD for example is showing a nice BULF formation. Take a look Chrz

--- 帖子 #336 ---
GBPUSD, yesterday still closed above 1.6643, GBP is really tough nut. LOL, not sure if a 4H bullish engulfing will form in 2 hours time. i will take this trade if it happened once the high of the current 4H bar is broken. EURJPY, not very keen taking a long position reason being it's near to my 141.23 weekly range resistance, although yesterday tested daily support and bounced high leaving a long tail. it could explode and take out both the daily resistance and weekly resistance. who knows

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi Zx, I believe GBP is a better place to concentrate efforts today, but as you said- who knows. I just think that the news coming in an hour from UK could move GU nicely upwards and close a 4H bullish engulfing candle... I am still looking for a shorter frame entry on the GU

--- 帖子 #338 ---
What a day... no trades again... a third in a row what about u guys? Any optimism

--- 帖子 #339 ---
GBPUSD 4h does close up. what do you think? 1.6690 entry with a 90 pips stop loss

Hi All, I’m new to the thread but curious. Unfortunately, as with most other threads I see this is following the same pattern where the number of posts about successful trades far out ways the number of posts of failed trades. Because of this it kind of makes it difficult to assess the viability of the system. I’m very interested in the concept of this system particularly because of its simplicity. But has anyone actually done any backtesting and can confirm that this system does indeed deliver ‘CONSISTANT’ profits? In post #87, AP3 said that he himself backtest as for him this system is proven to be successful but unfortunately he didn’t elaborate on this so I was just wondering of anyone else has tried? I see plenty of posts from people chasing trades now but really that doesn’t tell us anything about the long term performance of the system. Assessing the performance of any system can only be done when you talk in terms of percent of a main account. A good system will should return about 10% per month. Does anyone know if this yields anything like that? I’d be particularly interested to know what the systems performance was like during March and April last year when markets where generally in a state of indecision because of events in the Eurozone.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Erin ... I think your questions are a bit complicated for someone to answer , because the market makes every day what he wants , is not we non-institutional investors who do market movements . As if anyone did back test this system .... for me everyone does some form of back test your own , because each has different ways of seeing the market. For me I do not do many test back because what happened in the past is no guarantee that will happen again in the future the same way . Because if you're interested in it , do yourself a job and then you can share with Noos your work ? I hope you understand what I mean. I in posts ago I put several winners trades in which the methodology was the rules of this system , and I never hid any losing trade , so I think this is a good system , but it is worth just my 2 cents . My best regards , JVBS PS : If time permits me I will come back to put more business , but I wish more people also do the same, but minimally respecting the rules of this system

--- 帖子 #347 ---
My questions shouldn't be complicated for anyone seriously considering making money by trading FX. No offence but I am guessing that English is not your first language. This being the case then the issue is probably more in-line with you not understanding what I am saying more than anything else. It is well documented that because price has moved in the past that this does not mean that it will move the same way in the future. This is totally correct an for price movement but it is NOT true for trading systems. Trading systems have to have a track record of success otherwise they just end up being a waste of time and more importantly, money. How can anyone possibly judge the performance of any system unless they have statistics of it's performance over the last 12 months? Even 12 months is not long enough really but at least it does cover a cycle containing all seasons and dates of importance. AP3 says at the beginning of this thread that this system does make money. For me that is as informative as saying the sun will be in the sky tomorrow at dawn. All systems make money, but they also have a tendency to loose more money than they make. I'm sure AP3 was meaning that this system, along with money management, can provide consistency, the Holy Grail of trading systems if you like. I'd really like to see a trade journal or a myfxbook account of anyone who has traded this system for the last 6 months. It may seem that I am flaming this thread or looking to derail it. I really am not. Quite the opposite in fact. We don't need to be waiting for trades to happen now. We should be looking for trades that happened in the past. For example, within the last 12 months it would be good to know which month was the best performing and which month the worst performing. Also, what kind of DD (drawdown) can be expected. How many consecutive bad days have there been? You need to know these facts so that when you hit bad times, you have a measure for how long they will last.

I agree with what you say but why not try and do your own homework, do your own back and forward testing? If the strategy appeals to your trading style then you should invest some time in it, build your own stats and see for yourself. AP3 did a great job sharing his own method, now don't expect to have him work everything out for you... It will take you lots of time? right, the same for all of us... but that's what trading simulator programs are for. Just my 2 cts.

Hi Erin ... yes my language is not English, it must have already noticed I'm from Portugal As for systems presented here in FF, which are thousands, as you can see are half a dozen of them who have given some evidence that are consistent long a few years?? Because it will be?? Have I not right in saying that what happened in the past is no guarantee that will happen in the future? Why is it that even when we make an investment at our bank, always has this same phrase in the documents? Remember that.

My post I was asking if anyone else has done back testing and would like to share their results. I was kind of hoping that we could co-ordinate and back test together. You may believe AP3 has done a great job but what if someone gives 6 months of their time blindly following the ‘rules’ only to eventually have a lighbulb moment and come to the conclusion that this system doesn’t work? A fact that AP3 may already know. Who’s going to refund the 6 months? In this thread I see lots of high 5's and thigh slapping for a system that has absolutely no proof at all works. My success in FX has come from doing my homework, my friend. But gone are the days where I invest my time in forward testing a system just because someone the OP says it makes money. You may very well of backtested this system and are keeping the results to yourself. Fair enough. Or it may be the case that you haven't got a clue what I am on about. Again, fair enough. Keep gambling. I’m always suspicious of ‘Holy Grail Systems’ especially ones where the OP disappears after a couple of weeks without explination.... lol Anyway, I am not dismissing the system, I am simply asking if anyone has any statistical evidence to prove that it is worth investing time in? PS, Newbies. DO NOT use a simulator program. The F12 key on MT4 is enough.

yes. Makes one think why Hanover leave the forex? He proved that even their EA's are not consistent over time. Why this happens? Is what I said in previous posts is true. JVBS

Did you trade this just on the H1 alone? I only ask as all other TF's where showing to be looking short trades.

What I'm saying is that sharing a strategy like this one is a good thing for many FF readers and I applaud AP3 for that. Not saying that the strategy is good or bad. I would have to try it and get to my own statistics. The way you back/forward test is up to you. I've done it in many ways shapes and forms (used MT4 F12 key like you say, paid someone to write specific EAs that would export results to a spreadsheet, well worth the time "not spent" on demoing the strats, etc), and finally I ended up using some specific testing software, mostly because I am not keen on special types of indicators and also because it allows me to keep many years of historic data in one place, have quick reports and move on... oh, and also because I helps me to keep away from cheating and peeking the next bars.. I'd say, if totally focused, I could manually forward-test 10 years of a D1/H4 strategy in a week... so, to me it's not that much of a hassle to check out a method that interests me and doesn't come with all the stats... (BTW I'm not trying to sell anything here ). In a perfect world, OPs would back up their claims with proofs but even then, probably, neither one of us would trade it exactly like him, so in the end, the stats would end up skewed anyway. Anyway, all in all... fair enough.

i took this aud/usd trade av realised buys above daily open and previous daily high have a high probability and the reverse for sell i took 1:2 i dint do the stacking thing i was away from the comp am gone keep on testing this sys looks really promising

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Agreed, it takes a long time. 90% of my time is taken up back testing. So in essence what I think you are saying is that given that there is no historical proof of success, that the OP has put forward an idea for a system rather than a system itself. I'll go with that. I guess I could start a thread myself called, "Trade The Doji".... The rules are very simple, trade every Doji on the higher TF's (4H and above) and treat it as a reversal signal. Set SL at the High/Low + 5 pips and a TP in the reversal direction of (R:R) 1:4 &amp; locking BE at 1:1. I could post loads of past screens to prove how good it is and become an FF sensation over night. I'll have 1000's of followers and in my own little dream world I'll be an FX guru. The best thing about it is that I have no idea if it returns constant profits but I'll let everyone do the legwork for me and then they can tell me how good I am.... lol Come on AP3, where are you? Defend yourself...... Praying to the gods of Karma that you are ok btw.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Yeah, you just nailed the whole essence of these trading forums

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I'd say, just take what serves you, test it, see if it suits your style and go on with your own trading plan. Nothing that will be written in any of these threads has anything to do with your own success, these are just approaches, tools, concepts and ideas that you can work with and shape to your own trading methodology. A business-like approach has nothing to do with randomly picking strats on the Net and checking it out with a couple of demo trades...

--- 帖子 #367 ---
To me what matters is what will happen in the future not what happened in the past. I will give an example of why. Let's see what is happening now in Ukraine, the country is on the brink of financial collapse, of which was worth all of back tests on its currency? I'm giving this as an example, but it could happen in another currency. My two cents JVBS

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Lets say you where trading $1000 per trade and during the Cyprus crisis you took a big big hit to your account. Then you pretty much know that your system is NO good during times of indecision so when it comes to another possible repeat scenario of indecision you know to stay out of the market. That's the benefit of back testing.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
[Quote = Erinsunc; 7300799] {quote} Vamos dizer que você estava negociando US $ 1000 por comércio e durante a crise Chipre você deu um grande grande sucesso para a sua conta. Então, você sabe muito bem que o seu sistema não é bom durante os tempos de indecisão por isso, quando se trata de um outro cenário possível repetição de indecisão você sabe que ficar fora do mercado. Esse é o benefício de teste de volta. [/ Quote]. Hi... Erin ... I did not say I would not look at the history of a graph, it is different from doing a backtest of the history of a graph. I look at the history of a chart to see their S / R previous, and to see how it has behaved this currency pair back, but that I do not I consider I'm doing the backtest currency pair. Sorry but as my English is not very good I will not continue this discussion, maybe cause I can not to spend my reasoning as I wanted. Greetings and all the best for you. JVBS

i think Ap3's strategy works and it works well. it just doesn't matter, the believers will believe, the non-believers will leave, simple like that. in FF, the jewels are buried deep, people search for the holy grail indicators or strategies rather than looking at the naked charts to understand price actions, which truly worked and will continue working for most of us believers. Ap3 just gave another price action example, which unfortunately will be buried deep (we want to keep it alive so that it can benefit someone, i have my own price action strategy, other posters have their own, similar but never the same!). as for Ap3, he is probably enjoying his cocktail at one of the tropical beach with his laptop ripping pips off the market. he doesn't need to prove anything to anybody, and dont forget price action is not invented by him too.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Erinsunc, I am using a very similar strategy using price action and it has worked for me great. If you do have any doubts and you do invest 90% of your time, why don't you run the back-testing yourself? Just a suggestion... otherwise, I have tried other methods/strategies/ways of trading to only find that PA is probably the best way to be consistent and this strategy is just a very good example how to do that. But you have your own right to distrust what your eyes are seeing. It a part of human nature anyway... Good luck to your back-testing Chrz

--- 帖子 #372 ---
i think Ap3's strategy works and it works well . --- Why? Divine intervention or just a gut feeling? it just doesn't matter, the believers will believe, the non-believers will leave, simple like that --- Hang on a minute. We are talking about a system that could provide financial freedom. Unlimited wealth and the prospect of never having to work for a boss again. Once more, this 'lottery ticket' of a system is being given to us for free !!!!! Of course I believe. All I have ever asked in this thread is the question that anyone should ask. Has anyone done any testing with this system and has an idea one way or the other if it works. AP3 introduced this system at the back end of 2013. For those who have been interested from the beginning should have been trading the system for at least 4 to 6 week by now and I was just wondering, how does it look? I am gob smacked that general feeling is that what I am asking is showing disrespect in some way. I have said previously. I am not totally against this concept but that is all it appears to be to be. A concept, an idea and nothing else and I'd would have had more respect for AP3 if he had said as much at the beginning. It is interesting to note that no one has actually said that this system does provide consistency. Apart from the AWOL AP3 that is.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
As I have said previously, I am prepared to. But what is wrong in asking the question if any one else has ?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Erin, look around FF and point just ONE single thread where consistency of the system is shown... there's none, basically, because those who post the system do it probably on a hunch and didn't do the hard work upfront and mostly (me think) because once you've done your research and gathered all relevant data, there's two outcomes: the system sucks (ough to be the majority) or it works but the OP doesn't feel like sharing the stats because it was exactly that: real tough hard work that you don't feel like giving on a silver plater... Maybe I'm a selfish bast**d but I for instance will not share my own stats and months of research for the many systems I've back/forward tested, these data belong to me and my own hard sweat... I think thats why you will never get an answer, even if you mean well, basically it's the wrong question to ask.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
When I post I always work on the basis that a newbie to fx is reading. Maybe a guy who has lost his job and has been sucked into the world of fast easy cash in the hope that when his money runs out in 3 months time he will be able to pay the mortgage. I'm not in this position myself if this guy exists, I'd like to give the head's up as I'm not a selfish B*s*ard as you put it.. You say that there isn't a single thread on FF where the system provides consistency. I'll take your word for it as there is no way I have enough time in my life to read every thread but if you have, high five ! You say I am asking the wrong question of the OP, readers and followers of this thread. I Completely 100% disagree agree with you. We have already established that you have plenty of free time but you have to remember my friend, most of us don't. Time after time so called gurus start a thread like this, stating that it makes money. Sucking everyone into their world and in the process boosting their own ego. It's the claim that "it makes money" and "is profitable" without any proof what so ever that really gets on my t1ts! For them, this may just seem to be an innocent claim but the impact is far, far more expensive than blowing any FX account. People pour hours and hours of time into blindly following the thread. Missing their kids birthday party. Not going out with the wife of the weekend. All in the belief that the OP made a claim that the system is profitable. I have read about people shouldn’t want to be given things on a silver plate, yadda yadda yadda. How about people not wanting to be lied to and not being mislead . Ever thought of that one? Anyone who is serious about trading FX WILL but the time in. They will backtest. They will get up at 4am in the morning while the family is asleep just to put them few extra hours in to learn and prove a system. But if that same person asks politely if anyone has proof that the system is worth investing the time into learning and testing. They get classed as being lazy. You keep your stats to yourself Tradista. There is absolutely no reason at all to give them out. You agree that you are selfish. Fine, I admire your honesty and that explains why you want to keep them to yourself. But what does someone get from telling a forum that they have results but have no intention in ever giving them out? Why mention that you have results in the first place? Your silence would be more respected as opposed to your bragging. I’m not trying to get you to give them out btw. I’m just curious why you feel the need to say that. Can’t you see that at that level, you are no different than AP3 and his claim that this does make money?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
The only reason I said that is because I feel that you are where I was a couple years ago, you want to succeed, it shows in your words. Believe me, I'm not offended a bit by you question, you actually where very respectful and do deserve a respectful answer, of course. Myself, I'm just taking the liberty to provide some guidance because I can see myself in the same shoes some time ago, wanting to take the shortcut directly into the system that fits me best... unfortunately, I didn't find any shortcut, I don't think there is one... So, the moment I accepted that time wasn't on my side and that besides the extra physical/mental effort of the endless hours of trial and error (yeah, I used to work a dayjob and learn to trade at night while my kids were sleeping) I also needed to give it time, for the subtleties to sink in, and PRACTICE hours and hours on my own, make as many mistakes as I could without giving too much money to the market, thi was when the A-HA moments showed up, and the all too "common sense" jargon from wizemen felt right. So, basically, I'm just trying to help, maybe I could do it in a more sensitive manner, but sometimes, the best way to help someone steer away from many mistakes is to make them hear some cold hard trues... not that I have to, nor am I directing my words only to you. As you said, many newbies are reading this, so I hope this discussion can help some of them (at least, that's why I am giving some of my precious time to this forum). This really is a tough business, really harder than any newbie could ever think, where you shouldn't trust nobody except yourself. It's sad but its true. In order to do that you have to do everything yourself, period. I'm sure you know what makes a system work: "it isn't the system but the trader"... I believe its true and thats why I don't care about stats given by someone else. I only trust my own stats because they reveal what I DID when I traded past data. No two traders will trade the same way the same system (and please forget the EAs). I do feel sorry for the guys who come to trading chasing the get rich quick dream... I've been there myself... Hopefully most of them will take the time to read and learn prior to gamble their life's savings away... Anyone who takes the time to do the "behind the curtain" hard work, finds his own style and master it, with patience and discipline, will without a doubt find success, it is inevitable. So, to me, it's the wrong question but a legitimate question

--- 帖子 #377 ---
well said, well said, Tradista. yes, there is no short cut. this is a profession, it takes time to master it, and it has to be done by the trader itself, any secondary information fed by others are pretty useless, or even worse, misleading. screen the charts for as many hours as possible to see beyond the price candles, by the moment of aha, you will find yourself very different from what you were and talking about consistency, it's a property of the trader, 2 traders trade the same system will get very different results, want living proof? google 'turtle trading strategy'. trading is not a get rich quick scheme, casino is on the other side of the high way. and thanks for bumping the thread.

GBPUSD trade yesterday only to find it died at BE after achieving 1R+. 1.6724 daily resistance was well respected. 1.6675 entry with 35 pips SL. expecting more consolidations to come before the market continues to move in either direction. now i am going to shift my focus to EURJPY, 141.237 still is the resistance level to be punched through and retested, only by then, price could potentially move back to 1.45 area to hit the monthly level. we shall see.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Good analysis ZX- I haven't traded since last week. Price looks locked in a cruel range . Otherwise, I am looking for GBP to probably break this range after the gdp data... Otherwise, I am currently watching the JPY pairs for a long and the AU and NU pairs. Let's see whether we are going to have some nice signals today. I am just attaching the NU pair- it looks nice, but a small resistance above. Might consider trading it

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I think that there has been some institutional buying here Looks like we are going to have a nice GBP GDP surpise

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Exactly my point. Thanks ZXD.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
FFSk, I'm getting annoyed now. Who has asked for a 'Short Cut'? Show me? I certainly haven't. All I asked (if you could be bothered to read) was a simple question if anyone has done enough testing on this system to prove it viable and worth investing time in to perform my own analysis. The kind of answer I was looking for was, either....."Yes Erinsunc. I've been following this since January and on the whole it looks like it's worth investing time into" or how about this as an answer "No, Erinsunc. I've been following this since January and to be honest I've not been getting the results I expected. Not too sure why but the OP having fecked off doesn't exactly help the cause".. That's all I was expecting. Even no reply at all would of been ok but all I get is a barrage of useless, uninformative patronising shyte from people that are obviously no better than me at trading trading otherwise they wouldn't be here in the first place. Honestly people. Quit with this "Holier than thou" attitude. Life is too short. It's almost as if knowledge is power. FFSK you think I was asking you to come to my home and click on my and take trades for me. Sorry I bloody asked.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Glad you got to the bottom line BTW Ask a trained runner his opinion about running 3 laps around a particular stadium... can it be done? Could he do it? Could you do it? what do you think would be his answer? The point is, it depends on who is doing it... so there's no point in asking... No need to get annoyed. I'm done with this thread. Happy trading to all.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
What more you need to know? When you ask a simple question and nobody is giving you a simple and straight answer, and all you get is the usual mumbo jumbo crap....isnt that clear enough? On the other hand, since you brought it in discussion, im curious...have you done any testing and found any system here that was proven viable and worth investing time in it? That would be an extraordinary discovery :-)

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I am here and have been the whole time. Although I do not check the thread everyday, I have read every single post. I am still trading (and yes, this SAME strategy, have been for a long time and will continue to do so, unchanged), and have other interests that take up the rest of my time (no, not sitting on a beach with a drink. I have a real life). Sorry if I don't post very much anymore, but I've already given the entire strategy in the first post. And haven't seen any major questions that needed answering beyond the first few pages. If you've posted a question that hasn't been answered, it probably means you're overthinking things, and the answer is already in the thread. I just don't want to keep repeating myself, that's all. No disrespect intended. You've all seemed to be posting and trading and carrying the thread along fine in good spirits (although a little short-sited on take profits), well done. Up until the last few pages. It's starting to become more of an argument and not so much trading. Such is the fate of most FF threads I guess. That's ok. At the same time, there's also a fine line between a good debate and an argument. I do not understand what you want me to 'defend', or why I am required to do so in the first place. I've clearly stated multiple times that this strategy works for me, explained how the strategy works, and now go do what you want with it. It will be different for everyone whether they change the rules or not. I am about trading, that's all. Not boosting my ego, or getting subscribers, or bickering on message boards. I've also already done my own work, no 'legwork' from internet strangers needed. You are the kind of FF poster that keeps me from posting more than I'd like sometimes. Ironically, here I am, quoting one of your posts... To all that have shown general interest and understanding of this strategy, and who've kept this a peaceful thread up until recently, thank you.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
the 4H long wicks both up and down made me uncomfortable taking that trade. anyway, the high of the 4H was not broken, thus no trade at all. what is interesting now is the first 4H closed in Asian session. 2 bar engulfing. i will take this one.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
no momentum, although the high of the 2nd 4H of the day slightly overshoot the 1st 4H by less than a pip, trade didn't trigger for 5 pips buffer. 2nd 4H down candle invalidated the order. see if 3rd 4H closed engulfing 2nd 4H. no hurry rushing into a trade.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi Ap3, glad u r here I believe the ones that understand the beauty of the system will continue using it, while the others will try to find ways to disprove it. It's the same in life- just a different point of view. But I believe it is better to concentrate on finding the next "great trade". Again, great job man! Chrz

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi ZX, I am looking at the same pair and scaled down to 1H, which looks promising. The only obstacle I see is the level- 6670, or where the monthly resistance is. It has been the reason why price has been just range-trading recently. But let's see what PA will show us. Chrz

--- 帖子 #390 ---
good morning nasko, i normally don't trade EURUSD, but i think yesterday down candle is very interesting, it closed exactly at my weekly support 1.3685. i am looking for a short entry if bearish 4H engulfing candle formed.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
HI ZX, I have noticed that, have a look at the AUD/USD- same story there I was just wondering about it, but in general these S/R areas might be tricky, so I am looking for a retest first before entering, otherwise might have too many fakeys but let's see m8

--- 帖子 #392 ---
By the way ZX, I am looking at the NU for an engulfing- I believe that pair might have some potential for a nice move up- middle of the range and an upside momentum- just waiting to see a close on the 1H chart. I am indeed watching a few pairs at the same time, but this one looks it might form a BULF in about 25 mins let's see

--- 帖子 #393 ---
yes, i agree with you. fakeys are bad and S/R lines are subjective. the down candle of yesterday could only mean a small correction as overall in the past few weeks it was going up. this is indeed a counter trend trade if it happened.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Yeah, I agree man, otherwise when u mentioned EUR, made me look at EJ- looks like we've got an engulfing bear on the 4H and another one trying to form on the 1H and just got one on th 15M

--- 帖子 #395 ---
The only problem with EJ is that it is in an uptrend and it just doesn't feel really comfortable trading counter, but who knows- the signal is there

--- 帖子 #396 ---
ZX, stop shorting this EJ daaamn, someone pushed this red button literally seconds after I posted my last thread

--- 帖子 #397 ---
it moved down fast breaking yesterday's low at 1.3660. still about 2 hours to complete the 4H candle for me. i will wait and hopefully it does not drop too much, leave me some pips, LOL

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Heheh, just went long NZD/USD found a nice low risk setup - totally missed the EJ- maybe as u said 4 H would be next opportunity, but let's see .... maan, this EJ was fast

--- 帖子 #399 ---
EURUSD 4H is about to conclude, closed below yesterday low. i am going to short this one.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi .. nice to see you again AP3, your system is good, but each has its own way of dealing him, who is like around here who do not like simple, goes away, I'll stay! Here in this trade is a retraction then rejecting the day's low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) JVBS

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hey ZX, sorry to hear u entered on that 4H. It looked like a proper setup, but this support turned out to be a tricky one. Tomorrow is another day- another day, another setup Chrz

--- 帖子 #402 ---
By the way guys, as we all have seen in the past week or so GBP/USD has been locked in a range. We are just below a strong multiyear resistance, which would be difficult to break. But the Daily chart might form a bullish engulfing, so be prepared to take appropriate action if the right setup shows.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
The multimeter shows if each candle is currently up or down, green or red. If H4 is red, price is down from its open. If D1 is green, price is up from its open.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
good morning nasko, the beauty of having a buffer of 5 pips always works wonderfully. the low of the 4H bearish engulfing setup bar is 1.36420, whereas the next 4H low is 1.36421, and my stop entry was set 1.3637. i wasn't in. i am ok to give up a few pips so that broker wont 'accidentally' screw me up. i learnt it in a hard way considering how many times i was stopped out by a pip or so in the past. [edit] a typo

--- 帖子 #405 ---
now price is pushed backed to the weekly range between 1.3685 and 1.3772. will see.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
sorry, have to edit for my wrong analysis, morning blue pardon me. on 25/02/2014, daily closed above the previous daily open, to me, that's a signal price will go up. so i seek a 4H entry on 26/02/2014, but it died at BE later. the high and low of 25/02/2014 are 1.66779 and 1.65825, the low just missed 5 pips to my monthly R 1.6577, so i consider that was a test to a broken R now S. on 26/02/2014, price closed at 1.66774, coincidence? just at the high of 25/02/2014, the daily range is not broken concretely. until yesterday 28/02/2014, long lower wick, closed at 1.66829, small candle body but also closed above 27/02/2014's open. i expect price to move higher which in line with the overall up trend.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hello JVBS, What is the indicator????Please advise.Thank you

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Good morning felas, ZX- I totally agree w ur analysis, as well about the GU- happy u didn't get filled on this EU trade... otherwise, we do already have BULF on the Daily GU, so it is time for a range breakout.... there is a signal forming on the 4H, as well and all the TFs below...

--- 帖子 #409 ---
As a further confirmation comes all other GBP pairs, where we see engulfing patterns, as well- that's a good indicator for overall direction, as well So, good trading guys

--- 帖子 #410 ---
yes, 4H is forming, except it's approaching 1.67547 weekly resistance. the 4H body is very long without any strong news. i guess it might be the bears closed their shorts. nevertheless, i will seek opportunities to long. still 2 more hours to go.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I am looking at this resistance and am thinking that we need some piece of news to break through like the USD GDP, so I believe things would be quiet from now on till the USD GDP hits the wires. In the meantime, time to chill- overtrading leads to bad results

--- 帖子 #412 ---
yes, i agree with you. i try not to go down below 4H. it's quite important for me to seldom pull the trigger, the less the better. like one of my mentor said to trade like a sniper instead of a machine gunner.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
gee.. ok ok i am old and slow. by the time i prepare the older, this thing shot through the roof. now it's back below the high with 15 minutes. what a mad day. i think i will give myself a break on this crazy month end Friday. come back next week. have a good weekend lads.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
anybody caught this text book entry e/u above daily open and above previous daily high ........i missed it argggh feel like pulling hair

--- 帖子 #415 ---
just wondering does anyone know how i can have the custom indicators in this system in the mobile mt4 on an android phone

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hehe- ZX- I called it a day on UK open- decided to take a break today and missing some grandiousse movements , but I am really not upset and Njokie- u shouldn't be, as well, because those setups occur every day- in one currency pair/commodity or another- but relaxation and a great state of mind is better than stressing out on missed opportunities. It is always great to take a break from the markets and come back full with energy and enthusiasm. I believe that is my way to stay consistent- not just the system I am using. But I agree with you, that this was a really great setup. Let's look for the next one, but only after a good break for the eyes of the chartist has been taken Have a good weekend ZX and everybody else Chrz

HI at all, first, I would like to tell at AP3 a BIG THANK YOU for sharing this strategy. At the beginning of the week I opened a demo and I applied the strategy with a litlle modification and On friday the account increased around 8 %. thank you . My problem was , because I stay In eastof Canada( Montréal) and the best market is the open London Market and I can not to be in front of my screen all the NIGHT, I can not to wait until a engulf signal come.... I used the last fractal ( breakout) with the position of the daily open line: if is upper is a buy and below a sell but a big warning with the higher TF and the weekly open line ( same than the daily open line). the result was a multi entry on the gbpcad and this night a big gain.... it is not perfect because I don't use a stop loss but I used a small lot size ( I tooked a 0.15 or $0.15, nano lot). My worst DD was around 5-6% ( used trackrecord indicator). NOw I would some suggestions to improve my results. What be the time to be in front of the screen on the daily basis , what will bethe day of the week to trade ( monday to wenesday ro thursday to friday....) I don't know maybe some you. also, becauseI am not in the front of my screen what will ther best protection : stop loss and where or a little small lot size and in this case when I closed a loss. Thank you at all Jean-Pierre

Hi All, This is my 1st try. I decided I will do what Ap3 suggested and not over-think it to much and also just to start to trade his method (on Demo) and give it ago and learn from there. Here goes my 1st two trades. EURAUD H4: Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZDUSD H4: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi mor707, I was myself in the NU trade last week, but took profit before weekend. It looks quite nice entry, but about the second trade, I would have taken only a long trade after a correction, in line with the bigger trend, but it doesn't mean you cannot trade corrections. I do generally only wait for signals in line with the major trend, but that is only my point of view. Chrz

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi nasko, Thanks for your feedback, I appreciate it a lot. I see what you say about the overall up trend on the EURAUD, you are quite right. I see this as a learning experience for me and because I learn better by engaging in the market and learn by my mistakes, I will keep it simple at first and fine tune my approach as I progress. But I will always welcome and appreciate any feedback from fellow traders. Regards

This looks interesting and i think this might be good "tool" to confirm my strategy i now use. Thanks for sharing.

Hi All, I encountered the situation as described in the screenshot below. I would love to hear from anybody who has any suggestions or experience on how this could be handled. In the meantime and as I said previously, I will carry on experimenting via real time trades as this is a learning experience. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Reached TP on my EURAUD trade. This was a 1:3 trade but I could have gotten more but its early days and I still have to get my head around the idea to keep trades for longer. Hopefully that will come with more experience. I am still only trading off the 4HR charts and am monitoring 11 pairs. So far made 5 trades, 2 x losses, 1 winner and 2 still open. Risk:Reward of at least 1:2 and disciplined risk management (I risk 1% per trade at this stage) does wonders for sustainability of your account. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A bullish engulf has just formed on the EURUSD 4HR but I decided to pass on this 1 for the following reasons: Price has been making Lower Highs (LH) for this whole week so far. I know Ap3 only mentioned it once here but I am experimenting with the idea of only taking trades if they are also above/ below the Weekly Open. I just now see that PA is making a inverted Head and Shoulders so maybe this is not that bad a setup? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nice one njokie Here's my EURJPY trade. I must really start to do the stacking thing, so far all my trades have been one entry trades. Stacking is suppose to be the real secret of this method, which I am ignoring completely at the moment. I find that it takes some doing to stay in a move and then to add to it, instead of taking the 1st profits you can get and run. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Recommended reading for a deeper understanding of the strategy and trading in general. The trader and his decisions are more important than the 'system.' http://books.google.com/books/about/...d=gRdOBrus_9wC https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/...73-antifragile

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Ap3 - I just came across this thread earlier today; as I look at some of the charts, it seems that some of the candles identified as engulfing don't quite fit your description of engulfing in one of your first posts. When I look at said candles, I can see where if you include the candle immediately prior to it, you could consider it a 2-candle engulf. At other times, the candle may have taken out the highs/lows of the 2 candles prior to it; does that allow for a more liberal decision about the candle? Am I understanding this correctly?

--- 帖子 #439 ---
With out a doubt most of the trades posted as of late are hindsight or cherry picked to say the least and what is more none of them are in keeping with the original rules.What does this say about FX trading in general...be careful out there folks,this is a very risky business.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
yes, it's true. only some trades are posted afterwards. but i dont remember anybody claim this thread as its own trading journal and nobody is obliged to post every single trade he/she had right after the trigger as if this is 24/7 business and one has to sit in front screen all the time. and neither the original poster nor several other posters have commercial intentions to lure newbie into this business. whoever believes and understands this business, would enjoy it. and lastly, the business itself is not risky if someone just stays out of it. the risk is the trader itself.

good trade too mor707 nice RR yea the stackig thing is the real deal we need to pull up our socks

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Thank you edge540, As I am new to this thread I appreciate all the help that I can get. I just now again compared my NZDUSD trade against the original rules and I can't see where I have deviated from the original rules. Obviously, I am missing something that I am not aware of. Would you please help me by indicating which of the original rules were broken. Also, with English not being my 1st language I fail to understand what you meant by "....most of the trades posted as of late are hindsight "? In post # 420 on 3 March I indicated that I just entered the NZDUSD trade. On 6 March I showed the completed trade. That's the best I can do You are quite correct and I appreciate it that you bring this important point to our attention again. Fx can be a very risky business. That's one of the main reasons I like Ap3's approach. He advocates the use of SL's as well as a Risk:Reward ratio of minimum 1:2 bit preferably must bigger, all because of the fact that FX trading is mostly a probabilities game and therefore you should make provision for the numerous losses you will incur alongside your winning trades. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge and experience and I look forward to your insight as to where I have deviated from the original rules. Regards. Edited: removed some comments

--- 帖子 #443 ---
What a great trade that Usd/Cad short turned out to be. I missed it, but it is my favourite kind of trade, engulfing, off a pullback, strong close below previous s/r. There were no forseeable obstacles before 1.1000 round number. I am very annoyed I did not see it.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
For those into stacking, here is another opportunity in the making. Break and retest and rejection of 1.1000. Trading into the NFP release in an hour or two is not for the faint hearted, though: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi smikester, Yeah that original entry was a nice one. Just one comment on the stacking opportunity: its above the Daily Open, so as I interpret the rules that is not a legit setup, but I am not 100% sure if that rule applies to stacking setups or only for the initial entry? Also I see that my candles look a bit different to yours (different broker times and feed) so on my charts I don't have a bearish engulfing setup. On yours it looks good. So, I'll stay out of this stacking opportunity. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Well in my book, the daily open is midnight GMT (or BST) and midnight EST. I have a GMT and an EST feed for this reason. Both daily and H4 candles are affected, obviously. I rarely trade against the day's direction. I am not sure how to interpret Ap3's rules - perhaps this could be clarified. Both my H4 feeds show engulfing. There are various definitions of engulfing. For me, the close must close beyond the extremity of the previous candle. The open, and the other end of the candle are not so important to me as long as either the tail or the body engulfs it. While writing the NFP figures have been released and show the danger of trading into these major events. I nearly always stay flat as I always seem to lose.

Hello All, I have a comfortable understanding of the original strategy of this thread - except for one thing: can someone please explain in more detail the use of the Daily Weekly and Monthly Hi/Lo levels for determining trade entries? Thanks, Bry

Thanks jvbs, but this post shares the indicator - I am asking for a better explanation of how to use the indicator to choose and enter my trades. I notice that your trades are usually from the hourly time frame, what do you look for before entering your trades? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #453 ---
The goal is to stack H1 and H4 positions in the direction of the daily and weekly trend. How is this accomplished? 1. Buy only if price is up on the day 2. Sell only if price is down on the day 3. All H4 engulfing bars may be taken 4. H1 engulfing bars are ideal after a pullback, but not required 5. Trigger is a spread +1 break of the engulfing bar 6. Stop is 10 pips below previous swing low or engulfing bar 7. Move stop to break-even at 1:1RR, and hold for minimum 2:1RR. Once a comfortable 2:1 has been achieved, meaning 3:1 or 4:1, move stop to 2:1. Then either hold on for the ride or trail behind previous closed daily or H4 candle. 8. Previous monthly, weekly, and daily high/lows will be the only lines used for support/resistance. These lines can also be used for profit targets and directional bias. For example, it would be prudent not to sell into a market that has just broken its previous weekly or monthly high. 9. Each trade in a stack is treated as a separate position unto itself 1. Buy only if price is up on the day 2. Sell only if price is down on the day Hi guys, how do you understand those two sentences? if the price is up on the day, BUY only, which day? today? If it is today, we don't know it is going up or down. Or we compare today's open with previous day's close to define it is up or down, and then buy or sell. Same doubt about the second point.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi Shepherdl, the buy order and the sell order, if I understand well is always in fuction with the day open : market above is a buy market Under is a sell but you have to have to look for the week direction or higher time frame ...it is an help to show the direction of the market and if the market make a rallye or a pullback. If anyone is not agrre with me a or if I don't realy understand ...corect me. have a nice day

Hi JVBS, just 2 questions: what is the green line ontour chart ( is it a MA if yes can you give the number af period) I saw you took 3 trades, can you explain why or the strategy for? thank you

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi chienung..., EMA 20/Close

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi Traderbry, ShepherdL already gave the answer, what I seek is + - this, now you should understand how each has an interpretation a bit different from the price action, and this can not explain how I do on every trade, because in each trade can be done a thousand way to interpret the market at the moment, (price action). I try to follow the rules of the first page, they are the ones that are valid for this system.I do my entries in H 1, but before I try to see the trend in longer periods, H4, D1, W1 But you should understand how we are all trying our best anyway way to make trades, I'm still on that pitch. And it's hard for me to explain my way of negotiating, for lack of time and because my language is not English, then your translation or reading can not come out as I wanted. I hope you'll understand greetings, JVBS

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi ... liberty55, Ema 20/Close. I enter with 3 positions with an EA, which he does after I go out my positions by managing, EA pulling out part of the profits, whether in for profit I do not to have to return the Pips back to the market. I hope I answered your question. Greetings, JVBS

Question for Ap3 or others: In the GBP/JPY 4h chart below, there is a perfect Bullish Engulfing in a strong downtrend. The following bar breaks long which is, I assume, a qualified long entry. A hard reverse follows taking out the stop (swing low or low of BE bar +10p). 1) Is this a qualified long reversal? 2) Where is the reversal back to short? I am comfortable that losses will occur but want to be sure this one was not unnecessary. Thank

Hi Tulkas, This is how I understand the entry rules. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Thanks for the quick reply Mor. This has been a confusion on my part from the first page. On currencies like the GBP/JPY (or JPY pairs in general), there can be some seriously huge spikes. This makes the stops incredibly large. However, if this is the correct entry (break of wick vs break of bar open), then I will continue to study before add this to my trading. T

Both of these work well, I prefer the Candle Identifier - you can turn off various options or it will spam you with a mass of different alerts, I have it set for doji, engulfing pattern and outside bar. seems to work well enough for me. Have fun.

njokie, I am currently studying the method but am preparing to place small positions next week. I am simply worn out by spending so much time watching shorter term charts, I need a break! I tend to like pullback entries so I may look at the hourly chart at some point... The last two weeks on the GJ would have been excellent. T

--- 帖子 #482 ---
The H4 chart was showing a bullish engulfing, as well

--- 帖子 #483 ---
But the signal was not triggered anyway

As I zero down to the lower timeframes, the long was triggered by a "sucker" spike. This is what scares me about pending orders and un-monitored trades...

Go to Tools &gt; Options in your mt4 and fill in the Email tab, 'usually works pretty well, you can route to a special email address to make it perfect, I created one called something like 'h4alerts"at"googlemail.com' although not exactly that of course, it comes through on my phone but not anything else by my choice. different service providers use slightly different configurations for their mailbox settings, if you're not sure about yours Google will know the answer. good luck, Gizzledonk.

Good morning fellas, I have noticed this last hour Bullish Engulf on the EG. Have a nice look, it it showing some signs of earlier buying and has just closed above its weekly high, also it is located above its monthly high .... it is also about to show an engulf on the 4H chart in about 90 mins... does it sound too good to be true?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Same story but different direction with the GBP/AUD- we have a bearish engulfing just below the weekly support level. Now, I am looking for entries on the shorter term time frames ... let's see where those two are going to lead us Chrz

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Good morning Nasko. Thanks for pointing out that set up. It does seem too good to be true because we are about 15 pips away from .8400. I just bought on the pull back into the hourly candle you mention, and I'll be taking a long or two off the daily high at .8385. News very soon at 10am GMT. It may tell us if we are going straight through .8400.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Let's see what is going to happen smikester. We need some institutional push-up EUR dropped on the bad ZEW data, but now seems to be recovering losses and this is additional indication that this might turn out to be the right trade, but we will see... let's call those hedge funds now

Hey guys, is this a valid buy set up? I have buy stop above the high of the engulfing bar.

Good morning guys, Where has the whole enthusiasm of this system gone? It is working great and I cannot believe there are so few people still posting... Anyway, I have just spotted this bullish engulfing on the UJ. It is appearing on the 1H and the 4H... just bouncing off a weekly support Chrz

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Looks valid, but depends on where is your stop

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Yep, took this one myself, lets see where it goes!!!

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Nasko, et al, I do find this method profitable. The GBP/CHF 4h below shows a great entry over the last two weeks but I'm a bit confused about the current reversal. If I understand AP3's approach correctly, price must break the previous days' H/L before entry, but it is well away from the actual engulfing bars. Not sure where I should have entered.... A question I do have, Nasko, is your use of the 1hr chart. It was my understanding that the 1hr was used only to confirm a 4hr engulfing...

--- 帖子 #496 ---
My sl was at the low of the engulfing bar. UPDATE: Will move my stop to 1:1 when 1:2 is reached.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Yes Tulkas, you are absolutely right- the 4H chart should be used, but as I have said a few times earlier, I am using a slightly different approach than Ap3, but definitely not saying his is wrong. It is indeed the approach that all traders here should consider; I am just looking for better R:R entries- risking in general between 15-25 pips and that is why I am using 1H and 15M for precision. But they need to be preceded by a 4H engulfing, just like the case with the UJ was Happy trading guys

--- 帖子 #498 ---
While this was a perfect trade, am I wrong that price was "Down on the day", meaning that price was below the previous days' low so that only shorts could be taken?

Hey ubp, looks like a nice setup, but I believe this stop should be under the low. i.e. around the level of 98.25 if you want to go with the rules of the 4H. Just trying to be helpful

i think it is a good call for short (i short too) but based on the pb + bear candle on h4. unless it is a 2-candles tf, like 8h in your case, it is ambiguity to read the candle patterns because you can combine the pb to the left candle, and the bear candle to the right candle. just my 2 cents opinion. good luck to your g/u. cheers

Does it mean that if I have a sell position open in H4 and if I find any bearish engulfing pattern in H1 tf then should we enter that signal irrespective of whether another stacking signal is formed in H4 tf or not.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
imho: lower tf like h1 and below often give inaccurate patterns but again it is the trading method that the traders choose for h1 i look for the level with pb pattern cheers

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hello everyone , this is a nice system ,,,,,,,,,,I been fallowing it for some time now. My opinion on this is some bookers uses GMT on the their chart and so the 4 hour candle will look different ,and I think it would be more accurate than bookers who doesn’t? ( on engulfing patterns )….. Please do comment……… Thanks

--- 帖子 #517 ---
is the entry the lowest or highest of the engulfing bars BODY or it's wick? If it's the wick, what if that wick is not breached until several bars later? edit: sorry, I've re-read and it should be the body + wick. My question is what if there was no entry in the following bar of the engulfing bar, but one or two bars thereafter. Is it no longer wise to enter because the market has proven there is not much "momentum" in the direction of interest?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
thx dude... I am also thinking the same thing.. And my trust percent for 1 hr tf is 50%..

I have also been wondering what that statement means i even messaged AP3 about it but am yet to recive his response this is what i understand according to the charts below note that odds are better if price is below daily open and below previous daily low i just posted this for explanation purposes i could be wrong may be AP3 could clarify for us 1st chart 4h engulfing candle spotted next candle is at 12 00 2nd chart in 1h engulfing candle also spotted next candle is 12.00 same time with 4h thats my understanding someone could correct me if am wrong

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Good morning guys, I have spotted this engulfing, which has 5 more minutes to complete. It is on the 4H and in line with the trend. Let's give it a try

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Really interesting question m8, it would be nice to hear what the creator of this system, mr. Ap3 has to say In my opinion it depends on the level and the circumstances around the price, but that makes it subjective, so it would be nice to hear what non-subjective Ap3 has to say

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Nice call what i like about it is the fact that price isnt just above open but also above previous daily high i took the aud/usd in 1h

Looks good, the only thing a bit tricky with this one might be the resistance...

--- 帖子 #527 ---
which resistance? infact the one am worried about is the aud/usd has soo many levels to break upwards

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hey m8, there are two levels, that might offer some resistance- one that has already turned into support and the second one from 7 Feb. I believe that the price will range in-between before collecting more buyers next week, unless the news from CAD move it quicker.... u might be right in this case, because in general such news (CAD CPI) tend to move currencies in big numbers... let's wait and see future knows better

But she asked me about back-testing this system and since I am really happy with the results of the system I told her that it is great, but she really wanted to back-test it. Which made thinking that I might ask you whether you have done some back-testing, like 3-5 years back in time. If anyone of you have, can you please PM me with the results, or post it here if you don't mind. That would save my friend a lot of time and I am not really sure that she knows at all how to back-test. Thank you in advance. Chrz

hi nasko, looking at the big bullish candle a few days ago, none of the following candles closed outside its boundary. price is in a 4h range. usually i am very cautious about the uncommon large candles, either price closed above the high of the large candle with uptrend momentum, or price retraced to the area near the bottom of the big candle, that would be my buy entry if there is a valid PA.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hiya, nice explanation ZX I would be looking for long signals for the UJ on the lower time-frames, if not today I believe you might turn out to be right and buyers might lose patience and close their positions and thus push price down together with sellers ... But I am still optimist for this long side... let's see Anyway, nice to see u around again Chrz

--- 帖子 #545 ---
yes. i was overseas biz trip to HK, didn't miss much from the market i think.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
A break is always a good thing... honestly, that has been my slowest period in trading so far Otherwise, I am waiting for a 4H close on GBP/USD for a long signal Chart attached

--- 帖子 #547 ---
hi Ap3 , thanks for the thread.. gone through the thres and found that method is based on sound principal so m sure it will work..right now demo trading to get familiar with this method and has a little query Suppose we already have long stack and when reverse signal appears(H4 bearish engulf below daily open)..will it be consider to take short trade or simply signal will be ignored because we are already holding long stack and only bullish engulf will be considered untill market hit the SL. if the question has already been asked pardon me and guide me to that post .......

--- 帖子 #548 ---
No signal given.... the search continues

E/JPending short. Down on day and week. Weekly low as potential tp. Any thoughts

--- 帖子 #550 ---
sure nasko. I wouldn't touch GBP/USD until it closes above 1.6568 daily R. price has been ranging for a few days. on the other hand, i had a NZD/EUR long position opened and SL at BE now.

Yeah, it makes sense... still no trade for today... such a choppy environment, except for the aussie and kiwi pairs, which I did not trade, as well... hope u guys r on either of those trains... I know u got it zxtrader Gonna take a break Chrz

I'm open to answering legitimate questions, but this is the last time I address redundant ones. Please guys, is it too much to ask to actually read the thread before posting a question? Your question is asked in Post #35 on Page 2. The answer is in Post #37.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
hi Ap3, first would like to thanks for your reply I have gone through the whole thread before raising the question but i have not found the answer thats why i asked that question and i apologize if i am not able to communicate in a proper way.... and the post you were guiding it was about Exit... but my query was regarding Entry.. let me try again 1. Buy only If the price is above daily open - LONG BIAS 2. sell only if the price is below daily open- SHORT Bias 3. ALL H4 engulfs may be taken So the question is that if we have long stack and bearish engulf appears ( below daily open means bias has changed ).. shall we take the short trade if it trigers on next candle without closer of long stack? yes or no will be enough..

--- 帖子 #555 ---
could you post a sample chart showing the scenario the question will be clear

--- 帖子 #556 ---
eur/cad for once i have been able to do the stacking

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) At yellow upside arrow there will be long coz previous candle is bullish engulf and above daily open after that on the next day bearish engulf below daily open which will be trigerred on pink down arrow and price still not invalidated the long trade... so the question is second short trade follows the rule of bearish engulf below daily open but keeping in mind that we already have Long stack on previous day.. so shall we take it? or just ignore it coz we are holding long stack which is not invalidated yet?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Ukanimk, I believe that if the point of Ap3's system is to be stacking and trend-following, you should take the engulf, which is on the side of the long-term macro picture. If for example Daily/Weekly charts are showing it's an uptrend, then you should ignore second bearish engulfing. But a bearish engulfing is showing that the trend might be exhausting itself and be ready for a correction... In this case the fundamental environment and the longer-term picture are really important... This is just my point of view and Ap3 might have a different word to say, but that is what I would have done in your place, if of course everything else clicks on place. Just my2c

--- 帖子 #559 ---
thenx for posting the chart well theres one thing that has been helping me to avoid such wrong trades and its waiting for price to be above previous daily high for a buy and previous daily low for a sell and also breaking major level like weekly ,monthly low and high atleats thats what i have learnt from the time i started trading this system

--- 帖子 #560 ---
thnks to both of you for the reply..i am also in same line with you that the system is basically designed to stalk the position in the long term trend for maximum profit so in any confusion for the entry it is advisable to refer to the higher time frame and if the high/low of weekly or monthly has recently broken then it will give some extra confirmation for the daily bias but i was not sure weither people is making hedging when counter trend starts leaving the main trend entry ( for the market to decide weither it will servive or not ) as it is coz in the first post point #3 says ALL engulfs may be taken ( ofcourse which follows the other crieteria ) ...but i think its nothing like that . its about the entry only in any one direction as per higher time frame suggest... again thanks for your reply

Good morning fellas Any ideas for the coming week? Looks to be a busy week. I have found one potential setup on the EUR/USD. There is a 1H BULF and 4H might form one, as well. Still waiting for a confirmation to trade it... have a look

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Good morning guys, not really exciting times for the FX markets recently. I have just an update from yesterday's EU setup, which did not trigger a trade on the 1H, but is looking quite promising today- there are two 4H engufs, which are telling us traders are starting to increase their long bets.... any thoughts from you guys, it's been pretty quiet recently and no wonder why

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Short Trade, the unfortunate part about this trade is that I didn't stack.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Good morning guys I have spotted a new trading opportunity, but it needs a few more factors to line in before it is a valid signal. It is the UC pair and there is a 4H Bearish Engulf forming, but it is still not down for the day, but really close though. The other factor to be considered is the proximity of a weekly support area. Otherwise, it looks promising if all factors are lined up when the 4H closes. Just wanted to let you know in advance to be on the watch out Chrz

Guys, have a look at the GBP/USD. There is a Daily Bullish Engulfing and a 4H Bullish Engulfing and also a 1H Bullish Engulfing! I have posted the 4H Bullish Engulfing only . We are also up for the day and the price is sitting on 1H 200EMA.... what else can I say

--- 帖子 #573 ---
A little follow up guys- stacking in process, already two positions build... let's see where this would go and whether the monthly high is going to reverse it, but I believe that the Daily Engulf is giving a great signal to the longer-term traders in this pair, who are already long. On top of that we have a confirmation from the UK PMI.... what do you guys think? Any fundamental views on that? Chrz

Good Call Nasko....I also trade engulf along with Pinbar and IB. I will be following this thread Tunda

Hi Mailk, be careful w this one, because the pair is not down for the day and the monthly support is some 70 pips away...

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Thank you nasko! I placed my pending order below the daily open line, i'll watch out for the monthly line. If it pierce through the daily open with momentum then i'll take it. (it doesn't look like it will at the moment :-) )

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Yeah, on top of that if you have a look at 4H, you will see two bullish candles engulfing the previous bearish one, which is another indication we might see a correction.... I am currently watching the AUD pairs, but a bit too late- missed a few opportunities

This thread should revive for the benefit of the people coz the method is based on sound principle which works Anyway when dollar moves both pair will move..so lets see what market gives us.. Happy trading

Hiya guys, I have noticed this POSSIBLE Bullish Engulf on the AUD/USD. It looks like to most likely engulf for me today, but a few more things to consider- it is still not up for the day and it is close to a resistance area. Otherwise, the PPI might make it move past it later today. Any thoughts on that? CHrz

Hmmmm, that's what worries me- in such days I tend not to trade if I am not in a position already, or just put bigger stop , but we will see- every day is different

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Otherwise, notice the bullish engulf on the 4H AU pair. I am still wondering about trading this one, because the Daily is showing a Bearish Engulfing and therefore is a mixed signal. On the other side, we might see a bullish engulfing forming on the Daily chart today, covering the Daily bearish engulfing from yesterday... but that is hypothetical.... what do u fellas reckon?

Hi guys, it seems that I have been the only one writing recently. I hope you are not getting too bored with choppiness . Here is my possible trade for the day.

Good morning guys, I start having the feeling that I am the only person posting around Hope the system is working as good for you, as it is for me Here is my top pick for today- AUD/NZD is having a BULL ENGULF and is already up for the day! Have a look and hopefully share your ideas, as well or critical commentary. Chrz

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hello guys, I can't believe that probably the best thread around is not showing any signs of activity. What happened to all of you? Chrz

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi Nasko, How have your trades been going with this system? I would like to hear your opinion of this system and your favorite pairs please. thanks for sharing Jay

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Nasko, How would you describe your way of trading this method? I tried it several times, but couldn't get any consistent success. How are you filtering out potential bad trades in favor of potential good ones? It looks a lot simpler than it really is. Thanks, Bry

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi Guys, to be honest with you, I have a slight modification of this system. If you are interested, you might PM me for more details, because I don't want to change the original one. I still think it is great and is consistent even in its original format. Chrz, Nasko

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hello guys, I keep receiving personal messages about my trading strategy. Thank you for all your messages and I am happy to respond to all of them. In the meantime, I do have a personal blog for trading price action and you can have a look if you are interested. It is very simple and is using mainly price action for longer-term trading set-ups. I don't post trading ideas every day, since I don't get that many signals. But once I get a good signal, I do post it on my blog. http://thetechnicalinvestor.blogspot.co.uk/ Again- it is really simple, but I believe that that is its beauty. Otherwise, are you guys still trading this system? Please continue addressing me with your questions if you do have any. I wonder what happened with Ap3 and how profitable is the system for him now. I strongly believe in the rules that he laid out, so would be happy to hear from him again. Chrz, Nasko

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Nice blog nasko, good luck with it. As for Ap3, he unsubscribed from this thread, so probably will not see you support.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hello AUD, thank you for the positive comments. It's a shame that Ap3 unsubscribed from the thread, because his system is really great. How are you guys doing otherwise? Do you generate good profits according to this system? Chrz, Nasko

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hey guys, is somebody still following this forum or you have forgotten the learnt here? Chrz

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi there Nasko, I have actually been following another thread that is similar; it's called H4 Power and it's very informative &amp; educational. I have learned a lot about S/R there. Congrats on your continued success. Bry

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hello guys, Is anybody still trading this way? I must say that for me it is still working great with some tweaks. I would love if this forum gets alive again! Chrz

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hey Nasko, It's good to to see you posting here again. I am still using this method, but I usually combine this with the weekly outlook to determine potentially entry areas (where I will look to engulfing signals). This week I finished with 200 pips total, so I'm loving it... Bry.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
This method, combined with S/R levels, is powerful stuff! Bry

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Hi Nasko: I was trying to see how you have incorporated/modified this trading strategy. But the link of your blog doesn't work. Is there any new link or would you mind to expand here please. Thanks, FX_California

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hello guys, Happy to see some more traders using it profitably. I hope that you will continue posting in the weeks ahead. I have modified it slightly and use the 4H only for entry purposes, but to be honest with you, I do not want to mess with this thread, since it is the original idea of another trader, while my strategy is really close, but not exactly the same. To answer you FX_California, you can visit my website- colibritrader.com or PM me for more information. Chrz, Nasko

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Traderbry, I do also use S/R, but only from Daily/Weekly scales and sometimes incorporate Inside Bars and Pinbars from the higher timeframes, but still looking for engulfing ONLY on 4H!

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Nasko, Lately price has been so predictable at weekly S/R that I have been tempted to enter pending order touch trades at those levels. I haven't been brave enough to try it yet, though. Have you heard of or considered such a method?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Indeed, I have been entering at some trades using exactly the above-mentioned method! It really works well, but I should have a few other parameters checked before I do that type of trades

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Nasko, When you use the touch trade method, how do you set your SLs? That's been the major hurdle for me with trying that. Bry

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Traderbry, I will send you a personal message, because I do not want to change the original rules of Ap3 here. Chrz, Nasko

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Does anyone know of an alert that can make a sound and place an arrow on the charts when a candle's body (not the wicks) engulfs an opposite previous candle? I know of at least 1 alert that does this for outside bars (also considered engulfing candles/bars), but I need only the candle/bar bodies to be in the alert's formula. Thanks, Bry

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Not really- not really using alerts, since it is a daily candle and it just takes a few minutes after the close of the previous day to review. Otherwise, you can subscribe to my website and receive my trading ideas for free- I really do it for free . I do post mostly bullish/bearish engulfing and inside/pinbars. If you are curious about the webpage, you can PM me, because I do not want to spam here. Chrz, Nasko

EJ +200 pips - the horizontal line is the identified S/R from the weekly chart. Once price dropped close to this line, I looked for an m5 or m15 engulf back in the direction of the weekly move... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hi Nasko, are you a full time trader and using this strategy profitable on an live account?

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Yes, I am, but I also do a few other things more as a hobby to be able to resist the temptation of over trading! I believe that having your mind off the markets at times can be more beneficial than anything else at certain moments. That is why I do have a website for trading ideas and other interesting articles and I do also do a lot of sports... but to be honest with you, this strategy takes some time to master and some experience... Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Hey nasko, are you still trading the system? I have been testing it and wanna start trading it live. Would love for this thread to start getting active again.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hey mforex08- yes I am still trading it. Did you start trading it? I have done some modifications, but I believe it would be still profitable even without my modifications.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
To anyone who is still visiting this thread, I am planning to begin sharing my trades and thoughts on what I see in the charts using this method of trading... While I have read this thread multiple times and also related threads by 60minuteman, I have not been the most disciplined when it comes to waiting for convincing h4 engulfs before placing trades. Only later have I admitted to myself that I should not have entered this or that trade - even when they have occasionally worked out. I am hoping that by exposing my trades to the scrutiny of this thread, I will force myself to be more judicious in choosing my entries. I would much rather be wrong because of the market than because of my lack of discipline and patience... I have bounced back and forth between entering every h4 engulf (as long as it's not too long of a candle) and only entering engulfs that line up with recent weekly engulfs. The former can lead to more losses each week before hitting on a winner, the latter can lead to fewer trade entries each week and could possibly cause some weeks without trading (in the instance of lengthy weekly trend moves). My other back &amp; forth has been concerning trade mgmt - sometimes I have hung on for 200 pips or more and other times I have chosen 50-pip or 100-pip TPs (usually after having a nice movement suddenly reverse). I have several spreadsheets that I'm sure you all have seen that show how well an account can grow with wins averaging 50 pips per week, etc. I STRONGLY BELIEVE that this is possible using an engulf strategy. I have seen too many moves that begin each week with engulfing candles. My other problem is that since I am in the US, my ability to take all potential engulfs is severely restricted by margin regulations. I can't tell you how many times I have seen several engulfing candles, and chosen a pair to enter only to find out later that I chose the wrong currency pair - and the other pairs all moved in what would've been my favor had I chose them instead! 😤😤😡😡

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I see the value of this thread.. Anyone trade based on this? Could we reactive this thread?

Hi nasko, let's share more for this strategy.. thanks.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi, I just came accross this thread and am looking forward for the read. It seems no one is posting here anymore, what a pity. Would be cool if there were some advanced traders who used to trade this way drop by time by time so we can discuss ideas and setups. Looking forward for it. Cheers,

Is it possible to wait for monthly, weekly and daily price to be above its open(as a strong directional bias) and then look for only engulfing bars on the 4 hour timeframe? Can it work out better?

Hello everyone, forgive me for my English before anything else .... I have found in a Youtube video a trading system that I find very interesting. ... the yellow arrows belong to the fiddy-tma &amp; cloud indicator. I have found it but it asks me for some .dll and I do not get them. the red and blue arrows belong to some indicator engulf type (I think) but I can not find ... to see if there is someone who knows and can share thank you very much everyone, I attached image capture ... Greetings and thank you

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Can you share the link of the YouTube video? Or whatever else that relates to this indicator.
