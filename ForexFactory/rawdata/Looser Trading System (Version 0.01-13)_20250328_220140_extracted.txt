Looser Trading System Producer: Shayan Ali Location: Pakistan Looser Trading System Version: 0.01-1/3 Style: kiss-me (keep it simple smart-money expert) Recipe: make entries &amp; exit any time - don't care for london breakout, new york breakout or mount everest breakout - recommended time: When driving at 240 - while taking bath - after fighting with your husband/wife - in the middle of funeral ceremony - long or short all 6 pairs - place 30 pips stop loss - immediately place entry stops exact at the price where you placed stop loss and now place stop loss for second entry exact at the price where you entered first time - profit taking limits are sin here - exit whenever you want Looser Trading System Version: 0.02-2/6 Style: sar (stop &amp; revenge) Recipe: make entries &amp; exit any time - long or short all 6 pairs - place 30 pips stop loss - immediately place entry stops with "double lots" exact at the price where you placed stop loss and now place stop loss "double lots" for second entry exact at the price where you entered first time - profit taking limits are sin here - exit whenever you want - this is taking revenge from market because you have been hit a stop loss, so you take revenge with double lots Looser Trading System Version: 0.03-3/9 Style: e&amp;g (emotional &amp; greedy) Recipe: make entries &amp; exit any time - long or short all 6 pairs - place 30 pips stop loss - place 50 pips tp (take profit) - immediately place entry stops exact at the price where you placed stop loss and now place stop loss for second entry exact at the price where you entered first time - now also place 50 pips profit taking limits for second entries - you cannot exit whenever you want - now you have to see the consequences for being emotional &amp; greedy Looser Trading System Version: 0.04-4/12 Style: ob (opening bell) Recipe: long or short all 6 pairs at the opening of london or new york session - place 30 pips stop loss - immediately place entry stops exact at the price where you placed stop loss and now place stop loss for second entry exact at the price where you entered first time - profit taking limits are sin here - exit at the end of the session Looser Trading System Version: 0.05-5/15 Style: poe (professor of economics) Recipe: make entries &amp; exit just before high impact economic data - trade only us data - long or short all 6 pairs - place 30 pips stop loss - immediately place entry stops exact at the price where you placed stop loss and now place stop loss for second entry exact at the price where you entered first time - profit taking limits are sin here - exit when market has taken enough impact STORY: once upon a time there were 3 men and 3 women - they married each other - they were happily living their life - suddenly a villain came in their lives and attached him self to everyone - their life had been ruined - there was such a mess - after a long time a looser was born - he spent his life in mountains and jungles thinking about how to exploit this mess that villain had created. So after discussing with hyenas and hippos - he made a plan and revealed the secret to every one - though some hidden secrets were kept in the bottom of looser's heart - but - do you know who those 3 men were? Those 3 men were "eur gbp aud" and women were "chf jpy cad" and the villain was "usd" - this is not the end - watch next episode in your trading accounts DIRECTION: never ever add or subtract any pair - if you have chosen long then every day make entries with long and if you have chosen short then stick permanent with short IMPORTANT: first demo the system - when you are satisfied then go with live - this system is not the end - i am about to blast some more trading systems that are so much different and out of the box that you will say "oh my god - so simple - this we never thought about and was so obvious but we didn't notice - every thing i share you in future will be 100% free

Here is how the terminal looks

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Entertaining ! Please post some screen shot. LoL

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for sharing your system and your sense of humour! Looks like an interesting system based on correlated currencies. Am I correct to say that your system relies on one or two currencies to trend or breakout - and that is where the profit comes from? I like the idea!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Looser, Will test... Thanks for posting and the humor. Cheers

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Dont you think we should use indicator for this? One for confirmation and another one to confirm the confirmation, and another one to confirm the confirmed confirmation....

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Yes My Dear !!! You are Partially Correct ... Well ... After several years in Jungle and mountains thinking about CHAOS and RANDOMNESS and HIDDEN RHYTHM IN CHAOS and RANDOMNESS and also sharing views about Currencies with Rhinos and Hyenas .... Suddenly this system came into my mind ...

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Anyone did DEMO ?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi Looser, Thanks for sharing this beautifull system, I´m in demo now and I have a question: first 6 long (for example), 30 pips SL, then enter again if hit 30 SL but short now with 30 SL, and again, again, again....? I mean, each time you change long, short, long,....? Ah, now I´m in profit with your system, let´s see......

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Caillou, As you did LONG in 6 pairs... you placed 30 pips stop loss for every pair... exact at the stop loss price you place second entry stops (but this second entry would be SHORT as you did LONG in first entry) Now Also you have to put stop loss for the second entry and it should also be 30 Pips... NOW enough is enough .... No no more entries stops etc....

--- 帖子 #11 ---
thats is for what i m looking in the forums for hours, daily great job bro hassan

--- 帖子 #12 ---
ONE MORE THING !!! For Long Term Success ... Choose LONG OR SHORT !!! What does it mean? It means every day every time you just make entries with LONG or SHORT !!! never switch from LONG to SHORT or vice versa .... No matter what the trend is !!! Never follow the trend in this system .... Trend is our Ex-friend !!!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
The only thing I am in doubt OR Need a change is &gt;&gt;&gt; Holding positions for ONE DAY or ONE WEEK or ONE MONTH or TILL DEATH !!!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
So if for one currency your SL is hit twice you stop trading for this currency till tomorrow ?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
MY DEAR !!!! MY LOVE !!!! When you attempt to make first Entries and first stop losses you also attempt to place second entries and second stop losses at the same time .... The whole procedure takes only 7 minutes and 32 seconds .... after that you don't have to do anything .... In this system you just manually make entries at market and then place stoploss limits and stop entries etc... Feel Free to ask 48,000 Questions !!!!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
OH Sorry ... After Replying your question then I actually saw your question .... YES YOU ARE RIGHT !!!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Out of 6 pairs, example if 2 pairs hit stop loss (no we open new trades for these 2 pair if we were long now short)? and so on?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
What is the "Taliban" wife-swapping TP in pips? Is the RR good? Is the risk good?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
If one pair hit SL, we open opposite trade only in this pair or in all pairs ? I have 47.988 questions yet...

--- 帖子 #20 ---
If 2 pairs out of 6, you don't need to open new trades...Trades will be opened automatically as you had placed entry stops when you entered 6 pairs at market !!! so on ... so on ... is nothing here .... in this system there are only TWO attempts for entries and thats it !!!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Ok, understand now, 2 entries for each pair once a day and that´s it......

--- 帖子 #22 ---
As we all know, all indicators based on price and are feed from price, so depending on them are not recommended by professionals. As you all are intraday traders, I recommend two tools for taking profit after one day : 1) divergence on m15 with macd 2) Volume indicator. It's the only indicator that is independent from where price is. Working with it need a little experience, but it's not that hard. or you can mix both ... Now here's my question : Spreads are different on those pairs you mentioned. So why not trading just one pair in this way ? I meant selling and buying for example EU ? And besides, these days U/J and EU may move in same way because of the influence of Japan economy (you can see it by back testing). Another thing is I think it will messed up in ranging markets. But the idea worth testing for those who have no method to rely on. P.S. : I have my strategy . I'm just curious to learn other people stuff P.S. 2 : here's a market simulator which you don't need to test it for a year, you can test previous years in one day trading 6 pairs in same time will be a little chalange with this program, but it'll woth not waiting 2 years I'll be glad to see the results because I don't have time to test it myself Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hello I'was allways interested in this kind of trade, although never try it, because is not the way I trade, but, lets see what happens tomorrow. I placed the 6 trades on demo following your rules (and shut down demo platform )

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Now, in demo account, 10.000 each entry, with oanda , 58.13.-€ profit, .....

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Now 80.-€, ....looks incredible,...... Looser, do you close trades next day, or maybe we don´t close never and next day we repeat 6 news trades ?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Sorry, but now 175 pips profit, It´s must be luck but I´m going to test more, who knows ............

--- 帖子 #27 ---
In one account I short all 6 currencies and in another account I go long all 6 currencies. When the unrealized profit reaches 1-2 % in any of the accounts I will close all positions for that account. Let the positions run for the other account but I might take the loss if it hits 1-2%. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
A good idea, but I prefer something simple, i.e. a hard TP and SL, maybe 150/75, and if not hit next day, then close all and start again at the same moment with 6 news trades. What do you think Looser ? What is your experience ?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Looser, today is a normal day for your system ? because 155 pips profit is extremely high for me just in one day.....

--- 帖子 #30 ---
it will not work when GBP news or CAD news...

--- 帖子 #31 ---
the idea is not bad since the average range of these pairs is much higher than 30 pips.. and in case of sl it reverses... plus add correlation.. and u get well balanced strategy.. however to be monitored!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
My first day ended with +111 pips. I have now entered another set of trades. Cheers

--- 帖子 #33 ---
On Darren Teo's idea, long 6 pairs and simultaneously short same six pairs in another account is completely hedged out with a net return of zero (if he exits at the same time). In fact, a hefty spread cost, so a net negative return. And if he exits at a different time, why would he have gone long and short all six pairs simultaneously. Why not just long OR short the 6 (not both or the 12), per Looser Also on Looser's system, EUR and UCHF are inverse and are basically the same as just trading the EURCHF cross. And GU and UJ are equivalent to the cross GJ alone. And AUD and UCAD are the same as trading AUDCAD, I think (not sure because the UCAD is quoted upside down). Not sure why we would not just trade the 3 crosses rather than the six pairs. Cheaper, but I may be wrong on the equivalences/crosses here. Looks like Looser is "Temporarily suspended by a senior member". He cannot post or respond. Someone must have taken offense or he has broken some rule, or is a system vendor or his system makes no sense at all. Not sure which, LOL.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I think he is suspended for posting absolute nonsense, as this forum is not for people to simply waste bandwidth on foolishness. But not sure that is the reason he was banned, and I don't really care as long as he is gone.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I don´t know why Looser is suspended, but in fact this morning since yesterday his system gives me 370 pips , without indicators, without analyze the market...... As I said maybe luck, maybe not.....

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I am runing it for the last 19 hours and until now it is up 260 pips on fxpro demo account. I have also back tested for 30 days - the result for the back test was far from bing as good as todays forward test.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
The system essentially relies on 1 or 2 pairs breaking out, but since we do not know which pair will breakout, and in which direction, I go long in one account and short in the other account. This morning my short account showed a profit of about 1.5%, so I closed all positions and took the profit. My long account showed some profit too but after taking into consideration that two of my positions hit their stoploss, the long account actually suffered a small loss. Since the profit on my short account was greater than my loss in my long account, I closed all positions in my short account. Then I reset the whole system again. I am curious why Looser was suspended. I believe there is potential in his system.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Yes, a lot of potential.....

--- 帖子 #39 ---

Maybe like the experiment of Ronald Raygun: - random coin toss entries but with good money management = cut the losers, let the winners run. Then a sys can be a positive expectancy one, if you can do this (it all depends on the timing of the exits vs. the entries: the former don't really matter, as Looser maybe implies). Like a betting system vs. this usual endless/infinite regress of trying to predict/follow the movement of individual pairs. A mug's game. Brokers/system vendors sell info. flow, purported deep analysis on their sites, software packages and thousands of indicators and systems just like casinos sell food and booze as secondary attractions, but with the intent of addicting the masses, extracting cash from the masses. That is very clear, and it's deliberate and it's true. No doubt about it. Maybe Looser's idea, like others', is maybe it's all down to a betsizing/money management betting game regardless of the TA (Like Van Tharp's books on money management trumping all the TA), though he doesn't express it this way. The portfolio averages it out. Shall see..... Raygun's experiment....but the attraction of random entries can't be that great given the number of ea's he trades : http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=43541

A system is not successful because it does well the first day, or week or month. It needs a year or more to be successful. Keep us posted.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
i dont know if it s cool to hold 24h.. u can be out at 100 pips per day.. fair enough.. incredible.. but working good so far..

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I really like this trading system. Thanx to the creater. But the only issue is how do we minimize the losses so we can make higher profit. I noticed at least 3 pair will hit stop loss. So it cost us 90 pips already. We should make more than 90 pips to generate profits

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I just closed both accounts (long and short) for a small profit. I guess I could have held the positions longer. Anyway I have reopened all positions again.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
3 hit sl + 3 in profit + 3 reversed.. u can close when 3 reverse will breakeven the 3 sl ... giving you net 3 in profit

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Of course but you HAVE TO test it a first day, for me yesterday, 370 pips, now +55 pips (live account), if I close now + 425 pips 2 days, without indicators, only 10 min to enter trades, but as you say, I´ll test it more, and more, and more......

--- 帖子 #47 ---
lets hope he has no agenda...

--- 帖子 #48 ---
IT is a very interesting concept. I am up on Demo more than 450 pips. BUT on live account for very strange reason sell stop never got hit and all the trades closed for a loss. I am wondering whether we have to add the spread to the stop loss price or is it because the brokers don't fill the orders for some strange reason( Sometime). I trade thru IBFX. I may have to watch the trades closely and do manual triggering of stop loss if it gets hit.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi ES Trader, I moved 2 weeks ago from IBFX to Oanda and no problems, very easy, I place 6 orders (Long with 30 SL) and once in the market, 6 orders (short at the SL price with 30 SL) and all trades were executed perfectly.....

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thanks. I am going to check it out!!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Script does not seem to work. Is it in fact possible to have script /EA to open the entire buy and stop loss orders since we already know the stop loss is 30 pips. Just wondering !! Thanks

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I guess the last option would be a lil too extreme.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
How to know whether to Long or Short on the day, just choose any side &amp; test the Luck of the day if I'm going to "bet" on one side??

--- 帖子 #54 ---
3 options: -if u have an idea: take ur feeling on eurusd -if u have no idea: pick up some analyst forecast.. - toss a coin http://www.random.org/coins/?num=1&amp;cur=60-usd.0001c and bonus option: ask paul the octopus

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Well I found a little scrip which will close and delete all orders at certain time - user defined, it will help when we out of the office. Still looking for a scrip which can actualy open the orders. Another thing for IBFX the pending orders should be away with 2-3 pips from the stop loss of the first order, else the anti-hedging thing will kick in.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
For me, I go long one account and short the other account. One account should go easily into profit and the other account perhaps go for breakeven.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi all, Looser send me an email and told me if I could post this: "Can you Post this on my thread on behalf of me? LOOSER SAYS: @ DREAMLINER - I really do care for you. As you are an experienced trader. I always learn from you. If the system is absolute nonsense then it would be also a positive experience for traders that these type of systems don?t work so traders should not waste their time on systems like that. I only said lets DEMO it and see if it works or not ? There are a lot of systems here on FF that doesn?t work at all. I don?t know why my account is suspended. Do you guyz really feel I have posted something rubbish and crap? If yes then why other flop trading systems on FF doesn?t have suspended accounts? If system doesn?t work ? We won?t consider it anymore ? That?s it!!! I really apologize if I hurt anyone!!! If you all guyz feel I should not come back on ForexFactory then please tell me &lt;&lt;&lt; " I don´t know if I could do that. If not, please tell me and I´ll delete this post. My intention is only to do someone a favour. Thank you

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Try these.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
12 out of 10 hits stop loss = -300 pips 2 still open : 1 in plus, 1 in minus who say system have potentials ?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
12 out of 10?? is that possible? well some entries are better than others. just think if you would have taken the opposite side, you would be singing diff song

--- 帖子 #61 ---
those are ok. but really need sl added to them and opposite trade as well to be really useful

--- 帖子 #62 ---
For what it's worth...I vote to bring Looser back. This thread is both educational and entertaining (I didn't say profitable). Good Trading Guys and Gals!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I second that to

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This system has definite potential with some fine tuning. Infact I have been trading similar system with other pair of currencies for a while with fair amount of success. I use Renko chart a lot usually 50 pip renko. Because it is 50 pips the trend seem to continue for a while. So I trade these currencies with a 50 pip stop loss and reverse. Following are the trades I opened about 4 hrs ago.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
This system is like a riding on a smooth road and suddenly into a ditch. At one point it was up 450 pips and now down 10 pips. Not for faint hearted !!.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
i dont know maybe im lucky but i got near 200 pips today..PROFIT dont forget SL and REVERSE

--- 帖子 #67 ---
man dont hold it until next day ..when u meet ur daily target (u should have a trading plan...) just close and exit.. EASY

--- 帖子 #68 ---
im going long now let see what happens... oanda eurusd 1.3188/90

--- 帖子 #69 ---
welcome back, it is a great system

--- 帖子 #70 ---
What's the concensus for the best time to enter trades? I trade with Oanda, and if there really is no "best" time, I'll continue to enter when the average spread cost is at its lowest ebb. My $1,000 demo account was earlier in profit more than $40 while trading with only a modest micro account ($.10 per pip). I'm interested in anyone else's trading results with this strategy. BC

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I would also like to see Looser back. Sounds like he doesn't even know why he can't post. I am attaching an EA for those that are interested in closing all trades (open and pending) at specified profit. It also trails the whole basket. I didn't tested yet. I hope it works well. Cheers

--- 帖子 #72 ---
can you explain which pair I must add ea?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
nice. will demo it out. thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Gee.. I'm amazed this system can be profitable. how long have you tested it ? thanks

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I closed all my positions for a small loss. Six stoplosses were hit. I think the 30 pips stoploss needs some adjustment. Sometimes a stop and reverse position would be opened, only to have that new position taken out again by the 30 pip stoploss. I will make the following modifications to the original strategy: 1. Open all long positions in one account and all short positions in another account. 2. Use 50 pip stoploss so less chance of getting caught by whipsaws in price. 3. When one account shows a 1-2 percent profit, close all positions for that account. 4. If the other account is showing a loss, simply allow all positions to run till account breaks even or back to profit or when all positions have been taken out by the stoplosses.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Nice idea but could you explain exactly # 4 ?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I just closed my short account with slightly over 1% profit. No stoploss was hit in that account. My long account is now showing an unrealized profit of about 1.5%. But 3 stoplosses were hit in that account. I will target about 2% profit so I can exit all positions at about breakeven.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Ok, I just closed my long account for about 2% profit. So long account broke even, and short account had a profit.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Your long account is positive with 3 stoplosses ????? What do you mean ? What is exactly the balance on this account ? Thx

--- 帖子 #80 ---
May i know how much time you hold the account? Did you keep any TP?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Although 3 stoplosses were hit in my long account, other positions had a profit (including the stop and reverse positions), so my net gain or net loss for that account was about zero.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
The short account realized its 1-2 % profit in about 7 hours. All the positions on the long account were exited for breakeven for a slightly longer time. I think once the profit target is reached for an account, all positions should be exited. If we continue to hold all positions, there is the chance that price will range and stoplosses hit. Of course, there is also the chance that price will continue to breakout. I guess it depends on the type of trader we are. I have reopened all positions again, long and short.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Original System - LONG - Date 11/08/2010 Part 1 Buy order 6 pairs one hour before London Open, SL 30pips Sell Stop for second entry, SL 30 pips Closed all open orders 4.5 hours later Pending orders deleted. eTrader,

--- 帖子 #84 ---
There is some method to the madness with this system, and I interpret this to be an attempt to profit on the Average Daily Range of the pairs, and I am testing the concept by entering the trades and related stop orders at the beginning of each trading day which for me would be around 6:00-7:00 EST which currently translates to 2:00-3:00 GMT. The challenge is to know when to exit.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Why you guys CLOSE? dumb habbits are just carried everywhere...... even the author said "TP is a sin...", you guy still close like 5 hours later, or 3% reached. This is dumb, sorry for being frank, (which is helpful). what a simple and great system, and you still "HAVE TO" twist it... by the way, idea to expanding stoploss is not profitable, on the contrary, reducing it may..., well you of coz can try...

--- 帖子 #86 ---
be cautious i wouldnt recommend to trade it on mt4..better oanda .. charvo have fun

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Well Charvo The thing is, how long?? Anyway, you gave me an idea I will test, its a litle twist of this system and perhaps works

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Again I closed one account with 1% profit and the other account I closed at breakeven. Now going to reopen all positions.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
well, for "how long", you have to drag a chart for each pos to decide if you exit. this way is more troublesome, but just a bit smarter than x% exit or "I feel lucky so i exit". for me, i'll hold short of eurusd, and gbpusd today. the attached shows a potential alternative: about 10 hours ago, i short (random, could be long) a basket of 6 pairs, then about 1 hour ago, i add one more short basket (since looser said it is anytime, and i think it is reasonable), when I see whole market is down. please note that 4 or 5 positions have been stopped out ($10~15 loss) and reversal entered. of coz today is trending, so you may think that this is only for trending days, however, i guess that this system is mainly suit for ranging market...... obviously, i will hold eurusd, gbousd, usdcad, for overnight.

Day 1: 581 Pips.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Looser had contacted me, asking me to post his message to the forum/administration. He would like to know what is the SOLUTION to his problem. From Aug 5 to Aug 11, his account (0.1 lot) has turned from $1000 to $1535. He would like to interact, comment and share some tips about the system. Can anybody help? Thanks

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Original System - LONG - Date 11/08/2010 Part 2 Buy order 6 pairs before NY Open, SL 30pips Sell Stop for second entry, SL 30 pips Closed all open orders 2.5 hours later. Pending orders deleted (2 orders). eTrader,

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Looser seems to be online already, nevertheless I think Charvo (incredibly looser) has enligthed us a little

--- 帖子 #94 ---
He probably has to to email/appeal to the site admin., Twee, at: http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=57027

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Could you please tell Looser that since his account is just "junior member", (i'm sure his trading status is far more advanced.) he can just go on register another user name like "Looser II"? FF's administration system might have some issues that are not solvable through us. This is not the 1st time that I saw such incidents.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
dear, why you killed your profit so early? i'm sure that exit part of your trades is not original, while you may still say you are doing "original entries" .

--- 帖子 #97 ---
can't help it, but i want to add "Step .04" here, if Looser is able to comment in future, i wish he/she can evaluate my idea. step .04 is exactly a copy of step .03. when markets tightly range (that often happens), basket 1 stopped, basket 2, unfortunately stopped too, and here is step .04: you open basket 3 following basket 2, in the way of openning basket 2 for basket 1. drawdown will be bigger, but might as well as profits. just one nasty idea due to unwillingness to accept loss......

--- 帖子 #98 ---
it mt4 right click on it and tick edit remove all the m's after the currency pair and it will work on a normal account. I am looking at getting on made that opens all pair plus pending with stops. It should not be very difficult for a programmer.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
S Twee is the site manager I would mail him, http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=57027 Geoff was reinstalled on this thread after a similar issue.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hope this is helpful: a script to open 6 market orders + 6 pending stop orders. if 4-digit broker, adjust slippage and stoploss by "dividing by 10". if U.S. broker, it may not allow you to place 6 pending stop orders (since hedge is not allowed).

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Charvo, Thanks so much for the script. This is fantastic tool! Cheers

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Not working at all for me. but I AM USA with ibfx so i guess that is the problem can someone adjust this for hedge rules. (just place pending orders like 3 or 4 pips away from stop loss) but when i attached it, it opened 2 pending orders per pair. see pic

--- 帖子 #103 ---
there is no solution to IBFX. if broker disable hedge, then 6 pending orders will not be placed. screw IBXX is what i prefer to do, hoho. they even do not allow stoploss placed when a pos is entered (so called ECN-like crap...), so that i guess even your 6 market orders cannot go thru. screw IBXX again...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
charvo thanks and what if we double lot on reversal =&gt; then if loss again, standard lot if loss again =&gt; 4x standard lot so to sum up: 0.01 =&gt;sl=&gt; 0.02=&gt; sl =&gt; 0.01 =&gt;sl=&gt; 0.04 or is it too risky? im trying other combinations (reduce/add pairs..i know he warned about that.but i just demo it)..will post results if it looks better

--- 帖子 #105 ---
honestly, i had been working on similar idea before. i didn't finish the system and it was due to lack of time and energy...... what i got and think meaningful to be applied here are two things: 1. basket 1 use 1 lot, basket 2 use 1 lot, (same as Looser); if two baskets stopped out within one day, then basket 3 use 2 lots. so the lot size is 1:1:2, if basket 3 stop out too, then that's bad luck, we cannot do anything about it. Otherwise, we recover basket 1 and 2's loss and result in profit. the reason that i say this is not martingale is below: 2. if basket 3 is stop out, even basket 1 is placed in Asia open, I believe that 99% times basket 3 stop out during a NY session. This means: this day is GONE. even you lose 3 baskets, 4 lots of capital, you stop trading, you give up for today. no more, no more...... next day, Re-start trading basket 1 from 1 lot again. well, this is just for crazy traders to experiment. i'm in no way encouraging such trading or variation of Looser's method. In fact, i'll focus trading his "Original Idea" for now.

Thank you very much, Looser! Your methodology help me digest lots of thoughts and concepts. One issue is that i guess that none can replicate each other's trading equity curve, because everyone exit on its own decision...... how do you exit? i will exit at the end of NY, but for today's rare momentum, i'll hold it overnight. thanks again.

I AM BACK Hello Traders !!! I was missing you all so much !!! Well thanks to all who supported me !!! Thanks to Site Manager !!! Traders, I started the account 1000 USD with 0.1 lot from AUG 05 to AUG 11. Here is the picture that laughs louder than words !!!

Welcome back Looser.

Looser system is incredible! +573 pips today! And no matter what way going market...

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Right now I am tuning the system. NO BIG CHANGE !!! Some minor issues. Also Thanks a lot for the ENTRY script. This script is worth Million pips !!! Now I need an EXIT script. A final edition that closes ALL Open Orders (No matter BUY OR SELL) (No Matter PROFIT OR LOSS) and also closes ALL PENDING ORDERS in just split of a second !!!

Hello Looser How you deal with news should we wait till the news is relaesd? it should be better or not? Thanks Yoenes

--- 帖子 #118 ---
It's demo only If system will give me some hundred pips per day during this month I'll try it on real. Yesterday resalt was something about 350 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
hello all and thanx looser for this interesting system. however i didn't notice any information on when to exit. do you just exit when in profit?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
You just spot the knot !!! That is what I was discussing right now with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Actually yesterday I pocket 200+ pips after 5 minutes of a big impact data. Because I was looking that market was reversing. So In this system there is no technical analysis but you have to care about fundamental analysis. No need for a Phd in economics. Just to figure out how the economic data or news is having the impact. yesterday if I had not exit early, I couldn't get that much !!!

Thank you looser for your wonderful system.. for my first trade 530 pips !!! =--&gt;620 pip win and 90 pip loss (wiith 0,1 the pip..) in 20 hours trading ps: sorry for my bad english i am french

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Awaesome simple system. Thank you looser

--- 帖子 #128 ---
While reading this thread, I have got an idea. For simplicity I am considering only one Pair. Lets assume I buy and Sell one currency pair Ex. GU at the same time with a Stoploss of 30 Pips. So, as long as SL is not triggered, I will be with a loss of just the spread (Ask-Bid). Once the SL is triggered for one of the trade (either buy or sell), I leave the other one to continue for another 5-10 pips... The probability of having a trend continues (it has already moved 30 pips to trigger the SL on one trade) is slightly more and so the chances of getting those 5-10 pips a trade... Any Comments? Thanks, Prakash

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Easily attainable. eg, i use only 4h + so catching a trend results in many many more pips that 90

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Agree...let looser back here. Gotta love that guys sense of humour -

--- 帖子 #131 ---
another possibility when average daily range of each pair is reached...

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Charvo can you please modify it to then only place the 6 entry orders with stops, this will save me 3 min a day You know what I could do with that!!!

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Looser

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I was also looking into this. Enter the trade only and when the adr is below 50% and exit when it has reached at least 90%. Today entering at 9 am GMT

--- 帖子 #135 ---
anyone looking for an exit (if i may place the link) strategy for Looser's system should definitely consider this... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=89371 I must indeed credit Steve Hopwood for this magical little tool that is freely available and has quite a comprehensive thread/s dedicated to it &amp; its use. i use it often with trades to..."babysit" them.

Good Morning all, Just entered my 6 long trades, with SL and reverse orders....let´s see what happens......

GOOD to see you COME BACK sir Looser..... Just no cent question..... how can i get indicator Averages Daily Range (ADR not ATR...ATR,i have too in my MT4) to use with sir Looser system?? anybody member here have a indicator??? Thanks for help

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Here is one. I have stitched together an EA for this system from few EAs available here. I am not proficient in programming and I hope someone like charvo will improve upon it. All parameters are basic and self explanatory. There is a provision for profit in $$ at which all trades close. Any further enhancement needs expert programmers. Seems to work. Thank you Looser.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
another question .. step 03 is activated when the whole basket 2 is Stopped out or just one pair ?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hello Traders, There is some need for ADR - Average Daily Range - Can anybody explain why ADR can be help in this system? Sometimes Profits are awesome. A very few time some thing goes wrong. Why only ADR can solve this problem? All questions carry equal marks. Time left: 365 Hours. Passing Marks: 70/50

--- 帖子 #143 ---
why when SL hit it continues to buy (in same direction..) and placing stop orders too far..

--- 帖子 #144 ---
its just an indication.. if daily average is 100 pips ..dont wait for a 1000 pips move every day! /// explaine pls step.03 u wait for whole basket to hit SL number 2 or only by pair?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I am really sorry I couldn't understand your question. Could you please more explain your question ! Thanks.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
hello sir......can i give a NO CENT suggestion???LOL i think,that other member (i'm sorry....i forgot their name) was takes ADR as JOINNING with your system because we can know in DAILY charts has REACH or no ADR that day.....i know too many ways we can fine a good indicator to joinning your system.....it's ONLY FIRST TIME right???we all here have 47,799 suggestion or question or answer.......LOL any other member can give another oppinion or suggestion??

--- 帖子 #147 ---
i,AGREE with you sir.....that's are in my mind too.....maybe,other member can GIVE US a HOPE to suggestion or oppinion another indicator to work very-very well to sir Looser system

--- 帖子 #148 ---
by the way.......why are you LOOK so LIKE SHAH RUKH KHAN sir Looser?? in my country,MALAYSIA,SRK gets a HONOUR and become DATO'(likes sir or else)

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Yes I totally Agree with ADR. There is a need to consider ADR. Can anybody explain how ADR can tell us WHEN to enter? The BOTTOM LINE is &gt;&gt;&gt; Trader 1 enters at 9:00 - Trader 2 enters at 9:30 - There will be a huge huge difference in their upcoming Profit/Loss.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
It seems that you are consistent with London Session - Keep consistent with London - your results are exceptional !!!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
i think sir......start of a each day....i mean the MT4 trading time its 0.00....after 2 hours,we close....and OPEN new trade....maybe follow the LONDON OPEN or US OPEN and other else like that

--- 帖子 #152 ---
you have to take Step 0.3 immediately after Step 0.1 and 0.2 ... After Step 3 you don't have to do anything ... whether the whole basket gets stopped OR 1 pair

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I entry at London Open too, but when do you close your trades Es Trader ?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hello everybody In my country there's a saying "you guys are pissing out of the jar", why focus on taking profit? is not enough 100 to 300 pips on 1 day? once in this profit level get out. The main issue is not get stopped, to choose the right side of the trade its the main concern to me. My two cents: 1 h chart and 50 to 75 periods sma depending on the pair

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Because he was originally from Pakistan.

About ADR however i m not sure if the one posted here do the right calculation http://vanillafx.wordpress.com/2010/02/19/adr/#more-125

I am waiting for your today's result ....

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I took buy basket order yesterday night (US Time) and it didnt perform well. all 6 hit SL and other 6 are also in -ve in total. Is there any suggestions while taking either buy/sell and at what time, we should be taking it... London Session? US session? etc? I knwo that looser said, we shudnt be looking at the time, but I believe it really matters on the overall profitability of the system. Thank, Prakash

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Both my long basket and short basket did not perform well today. Stop losses were hit and reverse positions in negative. I closed all positions with a loss. Seems like if prices whipsaw, it will result in losses.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Yes ... you are right ... Time really matters ... thats why I started this thread that I can learn from you ALL ... I request traders to DEMO the system only before LONDON OR NEW YORK TIME DOES MATTER !!! I am carefully reading every comment, every post, every suggestion ... Also Nelson Elliott called me for a discussion. SOON I WILL POST the beginning of the final edition ...

--- 帖子 #161 ---
TRULY SPEAKING !!!! Mine also didn't work today !!! Can you spot the knot ??? There must be some reason ... If we can spot the reason !!!! Lets see what eTrader say ... He is about to give some results ...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
If price goes in one direction, then retrace, then opposite direction, ...... all our SL will be hit, it´s easy. SL and reverse entry is a very dangerous strategy, I test it years ago in Futures (Dax) and it didn´t work. Markets are most of the time range, not trend in short timeframes.....

--- 帖子 #163 ---
After 58 minutes, just before ECB Monthly Bulletin (orange) at 4:00 am. eTrader,

--- 帖子 #164 ---
What are your recent results ?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
We all have seen nice PIPS for 3 or 4 days !!! now today is a bad day !!! The problem is not SL and reverse ... The problem is TIMING !!!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
TIME is not important, important is PRICE........

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Yes you are right .... But this is the time that gives importance to Price ...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
How about analysing the trend of AU, GU and EU and take the majority trend side trade? If any of the 2 are in Bullish, we go for Buy and viceversa.....

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Suppose EUR is at 1.27 ... it made a small high at 1.28 ... Now Often traditional traders wait the price to break and then buy .... So the first time when price was at 1.28 ... the price wasn't important. But when it was about to break this high .. at that time 1.28 becomes important .. So that was the timing ...

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I started Demo the system from AUGUST 05, 2010. 1000 USD (0.1 lot) 1:500 I will show the result on OCTOBER 05, 2010. In the mean time ... I just request Emotional Stability ... Just Demo the system ... No matter Profit or Loss ... I bet the system will reveal something If there is an EYE !!!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
market is pretty quiet now.. maybe we will see some movement after unemployment claims. however i took buy order early in the morning at around frankfurt open and then closed all positions at approx. 40 pip profit. right after that i took buy again and is now all floating at around BE. would work much better if i had taken sell

--- 帖子 #172 ---
why not open trade on demo (whatever long / short) and the reverse trade will be on live account.. in that way even if range ..we reduce our losses.. if we could set some alarm...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Trader 1 Trade this system with all LONG. At the same day same time Trader 2 Trade this with all SHORT. Both would be having same Profit/Loss !!!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hello looser In my opinion ADR can only tell us when to exit and not when to enter . I have found this indicator on forex foctory i dont no how to use it but maybe some one can help it ? Thanks, Yoenes

--- 帖子 #175 ---
second day of trade with the method of looser : (6 short entered about 15 min before london open close right now ) +130 pips.. nb : the first day was 530 pip !! Thanks looser

--- 帖子 #176 ---
LolZzzzZZzzzZZZZzzZZzzzzZZZZzzz .... that was brotherhood love ...

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I am happy for you my brother !!! I think we should go London and then make an entry and get back ...

--- 帖子 #178 ---
i think sir Yoenes,your indi's are tell that the time MOST of people in world take a Short position then Long....that's why the RED LINE are cross the GREEN LINE and so on.....my mind think it's ONLY a little use to enter the market with sir Looser system.....it's my no cent oppinion....you can ignore it hehehehehe

--- 帖子 #179 ---
i agreed with you sir......i made are profit in Japan Open,London Open and now i enter to US open.....we'll see what's going to happen with my DEMO ACCOUNT in ikofx with deposit of USD 100 only....now,the account was grow USD 108.65....

--- 帖子 #180 ---
gr8... how are you deciding whether to go long or short. Or you are always going short before London Open. I was always on the impression that, during London session EU and GU will rise and US Session, they fall atleast 80% of the time....

--- 帖子 #181 ---
i just look at the pivot point for EURUSD to enter.. if the price is above i go long and if the price is below i go short

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Looser, you mentioned only choosing long/or short, so thats what I have done. Been long various times since you posted the thread and have had upwards of 300 to 500 pips in profit when I closed out. What I have noticed is a tendency for a massive increase in pips from around 06:00gmt then a drop after 07:30gmt (morning). Sticking with either long or short will hopefully make us right 50% of the time, let the winners run and we might have a chance of coming out on top. I like the open looser 6 pairs, saves some time, however a pain last night as the criminal set min 30 sl so buggered up the setup. Will set it earlier if I have to and use mptm to close down when profit target is triggered in the morning. Keep up the good work, I think this strategy has legs. M.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Pls share the indicator... also, should we really wait for one full day to exit. I think we shouldnt wait for more than 6 hours, as the trend might change with the new session... what du you think?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Why to choose LONG or SHORT permanent ? When you choose Long ... You make entries every day with Long ... No matter what the trend is ... how can a basket of these 6 can be Bullish or bearish ... So, What I recommend is you choose Long and make long entries for a month Or choose Short and make short entries ... As compare to choosing randomly Long or Short ... NOW, you will have more Profit with choosing and sticking with "ONE" ... watch Jet li movie "THE ONE"

--- 帖子 #185 ---
it will be intresting to have the point of view of looser i wait for his answer

--- 帖子 #186 ---
it's OK sir to me with your strategy comply system sir Looser..... now we have ONLY 47,996 or like that LEFT to try another strategy... at the end,we all must discuss what are BEST SOLLUTION is....hahahaha i'm joking.....sorry sir Bourseok

--- 帖子 #187 ---
i think,i agreed with you sir.....no more 6 hours to close all trade whatever - or + what are you SUGGESTION sir Looser??

--- 帖子 #188 ---
plus , u can brekeven the whole basket at x pips (or x% of account in profit) when u r lucky and u entered correctly..

--- 帖子 #189 ---
that's OK to me.....i'll agreed too

--- 帖子 #190 ---
"Taliban Jack" is gonna have a short life expectancy (in Pakistan) if he continues.... It will soon become the Bobbitt quick exit system. (Folks, you have to get with Looser's sense of humour)

--- 帖子 #191 ---
WORDS OF WISDOM Why we are twisting or finding other ways to change the system. I appreciate Innovative approach. No offense but If we just consistently Demo the original system for ONE month, it will reveal so much. Then after that from the results we can go further. Atleast eTrader please consistent with london open for one month. I am now going for my daily 1000 pushups !!!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
OK sir....you're absolutly RIGHT........i will do whatever you said....by the way,when can i close all my position after i opened it London Open???

--- 帖子 #193 ---
When 3 Husband Currencies are reversing and also Wife currencies are reversing...These Two Partner currencies must be reversing opposite because they love each other so much. These are 6 currencies. I am afraid If they have children then they must be EUR/CHF - GBP/JPY - AUD/CAD

OK sir.....now i know......(I am afraid If they have children then they must be EUR/CHF - GBP/JPY - AUD/CAD..........hhahahahhahahaha ) if true,we must put them together,right??

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Is the "funny business" portfolio simultaneously long and short the husband (long EUR and short EUR simult) for no net profit/"children", ha, ha, ha And the lesbian one is long/short USDCHF simultaneously?? Everything is becoming very clear, very fast. But Looser is right: there is no directional bias to the 6 pairs portfolio. The market decides AFTER you have entered which way it's going to go. Hence, he says, just pick long or short for the portfolio and stick with it, or toss a coin. This is not about guessing the trend direction; it's about letting the market decide after you enter. e.g. when EURUSD rises, USDCHF typically falls (the net difference is the cross rate EURCHF (the "child").

--- 帖子 #196 ---
of course...... That's why we must try it on demo BEFORE we jump into REAL account

--- 帖子 #197 ---
WOW!!!!! it's 56 traders watching this threads......what's a amazing performance....i hope,this system that's sir Looser build will go success i pray to the god

I have been opening each morning at 8am GMT+2, all pairs as a Buy. So far I am down 253 pips about 200 if I closed out positive positions now.

Yes you are right ... After all this system gave us some huge pips in days ... so there must be some potential ... Today one guy also claimed i think 300+ pips ... and others including me claimed bad luck ... So there must be a TIMING FACTOR for ENTRY &amp; EXIT .... We have to seriously practice the TIMINGS .... Anyhow its time for refreshment ... and i am going for Car Drifting &amp; Spinning in my Street ...

ALL we need is now TIMING ... Now the big question is WHEN to Enter and WHEN to Exit ? We cannot say anything right now. We need at least ONE MONTH. So here is the DEAL ! One of our Trader must use London Opening. Any one other use New York Opening. OR Love Letter Opening Any other use whatever he likes. and I am using Random entries.

Don´t worry, of course you´re not alone in looses, I was in profit first day and 2, 3 and 4 day with losses, maybe bad luck, I don´t think so. SL and reverse will kill you so many times......

--- 帖子 #227 ---
This is the sequence to follow: For a LONG trade: 1. Buy Order 2.Stoploss 30 pips below the Buy Order. 3. Pending Order , in this case Sell Stop at the price where you placed the stoploss 4. Stoploss 30 pips above Sell Stop at same price of your first Buy order.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
timing looks to be essential... at least today. got stopped out from buy and sell on GU, but if waited for london open, would have nice profit by now

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Mr Charvo, I noticed that your script is only open sell position, how about buy position? Which part do we need to change?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
This system will make you hate forex forever-- Some one have to be really blind not to so recognize a loosing system

Or this 34ema -- buy above sell beloW -- if you notice ( your stop will be about 50 pips-- (stop are place opposite side of the 34ema) hope this is clear-- scroll back and see how much pips you miss following this simple system 1hr chart hints big boys look at 20 50 100 200 moving average options broker set there strike levels by 50 points (oo and 50 levels)

I don´t think it´s a loosing system, it´s a very risky system but if we pollish it, we could create an excellent system: no indicators, no analyze market, no predict price (maybe unpredictible), ..... Now I´m testing only 2 pairs, EUR/USD and USD/CAD, enter at 9h00, exit 21h00 (I´m GMT +2), max SL= 120 pips. Now +52 pips, want to test it few weeks,.... Thanks again Looser

Why you always in Profit ? Why others not ?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
the system is flawed. long-term it will fail, sorry to say.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Can somebody make an EA to open the trades at 15min before London Open?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Could you please tell us exactly the FLAW this system has, so that we can try to FIX that flaw.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
This Basket of pairs is not perfectly hedged and if you take out USD (which is balanced) we are left with GBP, EUR, AUD on the buy CHF, JPY, CAD on the sell side. You can have any combination of these, say GBPJPY, EURCHF and AUDCAD. So this method essentially involves trading these three pairs. So we need to track these three. I have a currency ring indicator which essentially tracks three pairs should work for the purpose. I have set the three pairs in this indicator and I hope it should assist in some way. I am yet to test it but will try next week.

I am failed forex scientist !!!

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hey, That, that is a nice idea, good reminder... i have been thinking why trade 6 pairs? Looser, can you explain? why not 5 or 8 pairs? i didn't see why... by the way, guys, it is across board USD bullish!!!, why many simply placing dumb buy basket ??? why not start from sell basket? and i told you enter after London open. if you are looking for a stupid-set-without thinking-system, this ONE IS NOT for you. my 3 days Looser trading are not showing negative (not quite positive, i admit).

--- 帖子 #251 ---
i,LIKE that sir.......thank's again.....mee too sir.....in my mind was thinking what indi's or system CAN COMPARE with your system.....i believe that another system JOIN with your system will be a great result.....you remember that 47,990 to go right?? hahahahha

That's a GOOD IDEA sir....however,we wait what Sir Looser said,OK

So, this indicator show us the ADR of the currency ring? Thank you

--- 帖子 #259 ---
My idea is to buy all when the indicator is at the bottom and sell at the top preferably on H1 chart. You are caught if you enter in the middle when the trend is not strong enough. I will try it out next week for suitable tf. Even GBPJPY trend should be a good indicator as EURCHF and AUDCAD are not major movers.

MQ4 error 130 is a common one (look up with Google). Don't think the script will work with your broker. I had that problem yesterday and couldn't solve it. Enter trades manually with your broker. Gives you a better idea of how this SAR sys. works (like plotting TL's etc. by hand, which I know you are good at).

--- 帖子 #273 ---
For this error you have to CHECK 'Allow live trading' option in common tab of that script property dialog.

I am posting three indicators from T101 method adjusted for pairs used here. Hope one can make use of it in entry timing. I have no specific suggestion on how to use it as of now.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
to manage trades u can use Steve Hopwood's MPTM EA (basket option and/or Hedge option)... last question there is a problem in logic of this system .. ok you will win when markets are moving fast in either direction since pairs are inverse correlated.. but most of time markets dont trend.. and u re giving away in afternoon your morning's profit .. for what?! thus, it's better to use a basket of pairs which are positively correlated ..... the daily range is far above 30 pips (even in range conditions)... conservative exit: get out when u re 100 pips on the day (its my daily target).. i use 4 pairs meaning 25 pips for each... aggressive: when u are 50 + pips for each pair.. it s just my thoughts... i will do it my way ..let see results in one month..

--- 帖子 #279 ---
this system got potential. at first i thought it is a joke even looser dont know that it is going to work or not but it turn out to be a good system. as it has flaws like any other system. no system is perfect. there is one main thing i want all of you to think about, that is, u can make money with every system but the difference is who is trading. i mean etrader is going into profits. does any one thought why? As looser also noticed that etrader is going into profits. and the reason is patience. 2nd thing is dont just jump in trades, give some time to charts specially 4 hour charts. look carefully gbp/usd and eur/usd. just by looking these two u can determine whether long or short. if we enter in right direction we will save 180 pips. i mean just to see where trend is going u r wasting 180 pips. place only one time order no reverse order with sl 50 pips. i m only trying to improve results. one last thing there are days to trade and there are days when not to trade. should know the difference between them keep the suggestion coming

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I think your first indy is interesting to enter or exit depending the green-red cross. I'm going to try next week this strategy in M30 or H1 to buy or sell the basket. Because the true question is now (Looser is right): when enter and exit ? Many thx

Hi Traders, Please see Post # 1 Thanks.

Hey looser, I inspired by your system &amp; create a new system (inspired by looser 1.0). i m in heavy profit, but i use your ver 1.0 rule : never close trades till die or when you need money to buy Marlboro. let's see what happened Monday, till date accuracy is 99.99%, every thing have own life period, let's see how long system life.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Ok guys. Here is what I think and please comment as that is the way we will get this right. Looking at the E/U and G/U on the 4 hr can give us clues. Lets look? We see these charts clearly show the T.O.M., (Trend of the Moment), being short. #1 argument for short biased. 4 hr Histogram also shows badly oversold on both pairs. #2 argument for short biased. Breaking down the 15 Min Time frame, we draw immediate trendlines, (Yellow), and we see that a 30 pip reversal will break each DTL. In my view that would be #3 argument for short biased. SOOOOOOOOOOOooooooo. Way too much Support to play this strategy long here. So as long as we dont have any huge gaps I will demo this strategy short on Sunday night and we will see how this works. Please, comments are urged here. Jim

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Up 173 pips as of 9:15 PM EST. Dont know whether to put them away or let em ride. Apparently my strategy using the trendlines has worked......But, its only one time. Will try it each afternoon around 5PM EST. Jim

Well, I am not getting to excited about it. Been trading way too long to get excited over one shot. I will look at the larger timeframes around 5 and make a bias decision and do it again. But if I approach 200 pips I will pull profits once again. I may try to get the G/J, E/J And G/C into the mix in another account because I hink they can help. Jim

Here we see a nice Daily Trendline bounce and the real reason behind me not keeping my shorts last night.

You kidding right? " make entries &amp; exit any time - long or short all 6 pairs - place 30 pips stop loss - immediately place entry stops with "double lots" exact at the price where you placed stop loss and now place stop loss "double lots" for second entry exact at the price where you entered first time - profit taking limits are sin here - exit whenever you want - this is taking revenge from market because you have been hit a stop loss, so you take revenge with double lots" "make entries &amp; exit any time" - What??? "exit whenever you want" - What??? So you want me to just hit Buy/Sell whenever shoot around like a cowboy? What kind of system is that? "immediately place entry stops with "double lots" exact at the price where you placed stop loss and now place stop loss " Read again what you wrote, - "Place Stop loss where you placed stop loss..." *LOL*

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hey Looser, I am not getting the profits others have stated, I open in the London session and close the next day. I have been going long on all 6 pairs as per initial rules. From what I have seen, I get into profit not great profit but some (a little more than Simple GBP EA gives - Skyzer) and then if I hold the trade through the night the profits are given back. I am looking to now close at the end of UK session daily.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Looser bhai... I am very much interested in your system... but I am not getting good results... sometimes both buy and sell orders hit stoplosses and overall profit is in negative... Please tell me what to do?

I thought ''Looser'' said that you have to hold orders for about 12 hours and del them then? ---&gt; Why i get Error due 4049 with MT4 while trying to buy all 6 orders and close all 6 orders with the scripts from the thread???

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi, For looser system we need a script where we define that when our equity reach at certain point it close all position. every time we are not on monitor so we don't know when we reach high, if we open a trade in night it's reach to 50% profit in midnight when we sleep &amp; when we wake up it's reach 50% loss so script sure us to get profit. what you all think about it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #304 ---
well i thought ''looser'' even backtestet it upon running it 12 h from 1 hour before London opens....backtest were all profitable ....there is no need to build such a script i think?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
MPTM http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=89371 No, I think Looser is eager to get us to submit results so that he/we can see which variation is profitable. This is not a backtested system(s). It is why he is not submitting regular results of his own or the results of backtests (don't think he's a coder, or there are complications with multi-currency backtests in MT4). We are the jointly the guinea pigs/joint testers of an untested system(s). I think he's been fairly clear on that (nothing explicitly deceptive there, as he's said this is a joint effort).

--- 帖子 #306 ---
but they do work

--- 帖子 #307 ---
ForexMega, See post #71. Attached is an EA you attach to one chart. It will manage your basket the way you want it. It you wish, it will also trail the basket profit. It works well for me. Cheers

--- 帖子 #308 ---
ES Trader, I see that sometime you enter the sell first and sometime you enter the buy first. What are your rules for the decision making between buy or sell first? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
there is hardly a way to even jointly test it, if according to only our experiences and knowledge so far seen on this thread. this HAS TO be a semi-auto system. a trader needs to decide: 1. start from sell or buy? 2. when to pull the trigger (should be AFTER you see some momentum) 3. and when to exit that is that, and we should just go home with the scripts and EA available for this method and demoing for 2 months before coming back here to post results , but i'm serious....

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Forget the E.A., just make a script that opens immediately with a control long that sets the sell stops and if you change control short it opens the buy stops and closes everything out after the control, ( Length of trade ) = 1 Hr in this case. You would need only 4 control inputs: 1) Long Bias. 2) Short Bias. 3) Length of trade. 4) option for hard stop or trail stop. Jim

Looser Trading System Version: 0.01-1/3 Style: kiss-me (keep it simple smart-money expert) The description is good but it would be great if Looser could add that the entry stops will reverse the original positions. I know he does explain it in a later post. Anyway, I've automated the "kiss-me" strategy as I understand it. It's up to the trader whether (s)he wants to take any manual actions, but the script will run perpetually. These are the pairs traded: EURUSD GBPUSD AUDUSD USDCHF USDJPY USDCAD Initially open the six pairs all long or all short, as determined by the trader settings BiasIsShort and BiasIsLong. Note that one of these settings should be true and the other false. If they are both true or both false, no trades will be opened. A possible future version of the strategy would use (an) indicator(s) to automatically determine whether to initially open all pairs long or short. When losing pairs reach or exceed the exchange rates indicated by InvisibleStopPips, close and reverse the trades if the trades are not reversals. In other words, only reverse the trades once. If a reversal stops out, do not open another reversal trade. Close all when current equity exceeds 1% of last flat equity. Biggest winners and losers are tracked but do not affect trading actions. Version 01 looks for 1.0% equity profit. This is a setting you can change. Version 02 has an equity trailing stop. It's a bit complicated to explain how it works, I'll save that for later. It is controlled by settings you can change. Version 03 opens and closes on defined hours. Defaults: OpenHour = 9, CloseHour = 18.

Pluto2, I've implemented equity trailing stops so I'll put that on the wish list for a future version. It is a favorite feature of automatic traders. Please note I have uploaded a corrected version in my previous post that contains a fix for figuring correct point value regardless of decimal places in the exchange rate. Redownload if necessary. I did upload a version 02 with an equity trailing stop.

Indicator W_RVIM Is it the cross of lines, or cross of the level line you are looking for? The cross of the RVI line with signal line above the high level for a short trade and the cross of the RVI line with signal line below the low level for a long trade (level around 0.15 and -0.15) You can use also the RVI(10) indicator below each pair and place the 6 indicators under each other (without using the charts) to see the evolution of the trade (Timeframes: M15 or M30 or H1). Very usefull to see how the trade is developing and when to exit the trade.

The EA should need no customization to trade any type of account with any Metatrader broker. However be sure you understand the MaxMarginToUse setting before going live. MinMiniEquity and MinStdEquity are also very important settings and if they are not appropriately set for your account type, the EA may not take any trades. In addition to understanding the exact trading strategy and tactics embodied in an EA (which is usually only possible if one reads code), every trader must also fully understand leverage, margin, lot sizes, equity and balance. ___ eTrader, it is very cool what you're doing.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Time for a little explanation on what the LooserKissMe EA does. I believe it's an exact implementation of Looser's first strategy (the "Kiss-Me" strategy). However, it doesn't use stop orders nor buy stop and sell stop orders. Rather, it offers the equivalent trading actions via invisible stops and invisible buy stops / sell stops. Why explicitly show the broker our stop and reentry levels? The EA's logic automatically closes trades that go 30 pips negative, and opens new (reversal) trades on the same pairs in the opposite directions. Then, if the reversal trades go 30 pips negative, they are closed without opening any further reversals. So the exit strategy is clear: we either hit our profit obective, or all six pairs hit their invisible stops TWICE, both on their initial trades and on their reversal trades. Or, the trader can manually close all trades at any time. ___ Just uploaded a version 03 that opens and closes on defined hours. Defaults: OpenHour = 9, CloseHour = 18. So this offers a strictly disciplined exit strategy. We either close at the profit target, or all six pairs reach their stop levels twice, or all surviving trades close at the CloseHour. All automatically. The EAs' source code files are here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=316

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I have worked a lot with MetaCoder and with his permission I will give you a quick rundown of the inputs starting with the 01 version. BiasIsShort and BiasIsLong should be self explanatory - whichever is marked true is the direction you will trade initially - one must always be false. Bailout - default is false - if you change it to true the EA will close all trades and stop immediately. Slippage - default is 3 - this is the number of pips, + or - away from the requested entry price that the EA will allow trades to be executed. MiniSize - the maximum size of a mini account - should never be a need to change this. StdSize - the max size of a standard account - should never be a need to change this. MaxTrades - the maximum number of trades that can be open at any given time InvisibleStopPips - self explanatory Numbered days, Sunday through Saturday - I have no clue - they have always been in MetaCoder's EAs, but I have never changed them. UserTradingAllowed - default is true - just means that you can add manual trades in the account, if desired but it is not advisable to do so. StopAfterNoTrades - default false - if this is changed to true, the EA will stop after a normal closure of all trades for profit. It gives you a opportunity to stop trading without using the Bailout. Use it when you want to withdraw or add funds to your account, then change it back to false and trading will resume. As long as this is false the EA will start over, opening a new set of 6 trades, immediately after all trades have been closed. UseSmallestLot - self explanatory - default is false - if changed to true the built in money management will not be active. MaxMarginToUse - Default is 1.0 - this is the percentage of your account balance that you want to use for your initial trades - we have found 1.0 to usually be good when trading at 100:1 leverage and 0.2 has worked well at 500:1 leverage and other leverageas fall in between somewhere. MinMiniEquity and MinStdEquity - these are safety nets to insure that you do not lose your entire account - The EA will stop opening new trades when the minimum is reached - unless you are starting with a very large standard account, you need to change that one. Lots - default is 0.1 - not sure about this one - I assume it is the size lot to be used if not using the built in money management. ProfitPercent - default is 1.0 - this is the Take Profit expressed as a percent of LastFlatEquity - unless changed, the EA will close all trades and take profit when Equity is 1% above LastFlatEquity (equity when all trades were last closed). MaxMiniProfit and MaxStdProfit - if these levels are reached the EA will close and take profit regardless of other closing criteria. I hope to see these come into play some day. MagicNumber - With these EAs you never have to worry about changing magic numbers, because the EA is only attached to 1 chart and controls all the pairs without attaching to other charts. COOL However, all the traded pairs must be shown in the Market Watch window. The 02 version is the same except for the trailing stop settings listed below. ProfitPercent - default is 10.0 - same setting as above in 01, but here we set it very high to allow the trailing stop to work - if profit reaches 10% above LastFlatEquity all trades will be closed regardless of trailing stop. InitProfitMultiple - default is 1.02 - this is the profit percent above LastFlatEquity where the trail will begin. ProfitMultipleTrail - default is 0.01 - the percent loss that will trigger a close when the trail is in effect. The 03 version introduces settings to control what hours the EA will trade. OpenHour and CloseHour - defaults are 9 and 18 - these are self explanatory and are GMT times - the default is open at 09:00 and close at 18:00 GMT, 9 hours of trading. I hope this is helpful and I have not misinterpreted any of the settings. I'm sure MetaCoder will correct me if I have.

For my part, I'll be using LooserKissMe_03 to test the strategy. This should be a very close fully automated equivalent to what eTrader is doing, with the exception that the EA is not going to determine an initial long or short bias. The strategy looks good to me, and I'll correct any problems I find in the EAs. I assume no grail here. If there is a failure at some point, I want to make sure I understand why. Most likely it would come in the form of extended periods of SIDEWAYS action. And if all goes great -- it probably means we'll soon lose 100:1 leverage due to UNwonderful regulatory actions (an emotional, not rational, statement...).

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Nice explanations frazerd, it all looks correct. They are there as a convenience in the event we want to put in readable day-specific open/close logic.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thank you MetaCoder and frazerd. You are scholars and gentlemen ! MC... I share your enthusiasm for EA's for a variety of reasons. And no... I won't ask you to code one for me as I'm in the process of having one coded. I suppose it's the price I pay for not learning MQL myself. At any rate, I'm happy to give this EA a test and I appreciate your sharing it.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
You're welcome TradeRunner. Good EAs expose the goodness or badness of strategies to the light of day. At the very least, it will be fun putting Looser's Kiss-Me strategy to the test with no effort -- look ma, no hands! I love automation in general, it's fascinated me for a long time. If regulation cranks leverage down to 10:1 or 1:1...oh well, it's all been fun. Might as well exit stage left sharing all I've learned.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Ain't it the damn truth !! Hopefully you have a UK account. That might not be any better (always) but at least it's a "hedge" against US regulation for a while. Cheers !

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hello Frazerd, Thank you very much for taking the time to provide the explanation of the Kiss EA inputs. It is so well written and explained, it's one of the best I have seen. Best regards and many pips to you.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hello MetaCoder, Thanks again for your work on the Kiss EA. I have tested the 02 - the EA did verything correctly. After spending some time on this method/EA, I am coming to the conclusion that the timing is actually the most important feature. Thanks for adding it to the EA. This method needs volatility, hence the importance of timing. As I like to test a few scenarios with the 03 version (with and without the timing); what input would you recommend when I do not want the timing feature to work? I have used open hr 25, close hr 25 and it bypassed the time input. This brings me to a suggestion that maybe we should have a true or false input for the timing feature. Thank you for sharing your work with us. Best regards and many pips to you too!

Trading Rules RVI Indicator The crossover between the RVI and the signal line identify a changing market. Trading in the direction of a crossover means going with the flow of the market. Buy signal: The fast RVI line (Green) crosses above the slow signal line (Red). Consider a long trade. Sell signal: The fast RVI line (Green) crosses below the signal line (Red). Consider a short trade. Remark: The indicator does not show oversold or overbought zones. Precise signals: Sell when the lines are crossing at the top part of the RVI indicator frame Buy when the lines are crossing at the bottom part of the RVI indicator frame. Close the position according to the RVI indicator. Example Short Trade: Open a position at the first lines crossing in the top part of the RVI indicator frame. Close the position at the first crossing in the bottom part. eTrader,

To MetaCoder and frazerd, Thanx from my side also.......... you peolple are really gr8. Actually i stopped using EAs from last 2-3 years... but this EA is really different. Thank you very much dear friends. I will test this on demo account, but i am doubt whether it will work on real account and also looking for results of other members... Finally I am missing the owner of this tread... Looser bhai... Where are you dear? Eagerly waiting for your reply.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
eTrader Base on your explanation of the correlation, specially for UChf should be opposite. isn't it?. for 4 days I tried this method the UChf always opposite. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Simplest is to use version 02 when you don't want the time feature. Version 02 is exactly the same as 03 only it doesn't support timed entries and exits.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
You are very welcome. frazerd has committed a great deal of time and effort testing many of my EAs, providing detailed reports, and making suggestions.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Wow this is an interesting system. thank you so much for sharing.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Here is an example on time frame H1. From top to bottom: eurusd , gbpusd, audusd, usdchf , usdjpy, usdcad. Vertical rectangle (first vertical line) : -eurusd, gbpusd and audusd are moving parallel to each other (in tandem), positive correlated. -usdchf, usdjpy and usdcad are moving in opposite direction, negative correlated. The movement parallel or opposite of each other is only accurate most of the time. The EUR/USD and USD/CHF had a near-perfect negative correlation of -1.00 (februari 2010). This means that when the EUR/USD rallied, the USD/CHF sold off 100% of the time. This relationship holds true over longer periods. The correlation figures remain relatively stable. Sentiment and global economic factors can change on a daily basis. Strong correlations today might not be in line with the longer-term correlation between two currency pairs. It is very important to be aware of: -the correlation between various currency pairs -their shifting trends eTrader,

Looser is off, eTrader took the leading part in this Thread i think : p

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I agree so much with eTrader. Correlation among pairs, and confirmation of a single currency's strength/weakness against multiple pairs, are important keys to seeing what the market is doing. I personally cannot do it manually, I MUST use automation to track it for me. So future versions of EAs that implement this strategy will almost certainly look at correlations and/or confirmations to decide inital long or short bias for all 6 pairs. Haven't quite thought out exactly what approach I'll use.

It is a very interesting system. Looser, you are the man! Sure it is nice to get 300-500+ pips per day. However during the range we can lose 360 pips. What can we do? 1). Right now our SL is 30 pips for any pair at any day. We can place SL depending on the ATR (14) - 25% of ATR. For example, if GBPUSD's today's ATR is 200 pips, then SL would be 50 pips, if EURUSD's today's ATR is 160 pips, then SL for EURUSD would be 40 pips etc. 2). Instead of placing the orders for instant execution, we could place two pending orders per pair (both buy and sell), and then pending orders for these two orders. For example, right now GBPUSD is 1.5560 and we decided that SL is 30 pips. We place buy stop 1.5590 and sell stop 1.5530 After that for 1.5590 we place sell stop 1.5560 And for 1.5530 we place buy stop 1.5560 Let's say the price went up and hit 1.5590, then we delete 1.5530 and the pending order for this order (buy stop 1.5560). Of course, our profit will be less, but we'll avoid losing 360 pips during the range. Just my two cents.

Hi MetaCoder I used the VRVIM-Looser indy in H1 with 2 scripts ( long and short) and a CloseAmountatEquity 2 %. 5 trades all winners I'm thinking your EA LooserKiss Me_02 is excellent for this stategy. You said it's a first step before indy's using. In my opinion, we can use this indy to launch trades long or short depending the green-red cross. But we need a cross &gt; 0.10 because if the cross is near the zero line the signal is not significative. I'm not a coder but if we can use an EA with these signals and a profit with trailing equity it would be perfect.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Nice results Do you attach the indicator VRVIM-Looser on all 6 pairs or only on one pair?

WRVIM-Looser is a 6 pairs-indy. It gives an indication for the basket buy or the basket sell. If the cross is clearly under the zero line, we buy the basket and if it is above we sell. My target is 2 % but we can imagine a swing strategy . Today 2 basket buy for 3 % 1 for 2% and 1 for 2 % ( 7 % more) with signals M30 ...not recommanded ..lol

It's pointed UP (Green cross red below 0) right now for the BUY and all pair is in downtrend keep dropping, check your charts.

Hi Traders, How u doin all !!! Well eTrader results are awesome .... What is current consensus ? I want to know the system got any potential?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Can anybody explain this crazy indicator.. That screenshot of Cable, sometimes it going with the pair and sometimes goes appositive direction like now bottom indicator window:

--- 帖子 #378 ---
This indicator is reflective of six pairs used in this method. In effect it could also mirror GBPJPY+EURCHF+AUDCAD. So to some extent GBPJPY being a major mover, could also reflect the basket.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Today + 167 pips (only 2 pairs). Total since 13-08 till 20-08: 351 pips....

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Right but question remains, should I sell or should I buy In direction of this indy or against?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
But at the bottom and sell at the top when the two lines cross and hope that the reversal continues.. If not, the hedge trades will take over.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I have been scratching my head about that myself. Your better off putting an indy on each pair separately AND either trade in the direction of the indy on each separate pair or dont trade the pairs that are going the opposite way. I have been doing this and results are surprising, but I got to lock down the total length of time for the trade. After ONLY 1 week and keep in mind its only been ONE WEEK !, I have had modest gains. People have to get their minds off of the Expert Advisor crap and just start trying to map out a strategy. All that is needed is a script to place 6 trades with stops and 6 pending orders with a time input to pull the trades off. If we can get that we can run some good demo sets. Oh and BTW, make the stops trailing optional.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Anyone who actually has some trading expierience and wants to sit down with me tomorrow and map out some strategys, please let me know. P.S. Please, I need someone with a few years exp. like myself. Jim

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I think eTrader has shown the system has potential. Whether it's an "all-terrain, alll-weather" strategy will take time to determine. Here are fresh EAs to upload. Versions 01 through 03 now do not look for a rise in equity and balance to reset last flat values. This strategy can close for losses which is unlike most other strategies I deal with so this small adjustment was needed. Version 04 automatically determines the initial long or short bias. Here is the function that determines long/short bias: Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //| Track the whether pairs that have risen/fallen above/below | //| their 24-hour highs/lows. | //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ void CheckExceedences() { LongBiasCount = 0; ShortBiasCount = 0; BiasString = ""; if (MarketInfo( EURUSDsym, MODE_BID) &lt;= iLow( EURUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, iLowest( EURUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_LOW, 24, 0))) ShortBiasCount += 1; else if (MarketInfo( EURUSDsym, MODE_ASK) &gt;= iHigh( EURUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, iHighest( EURUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_HIGH, 24, 0))) LongBiasCount += 1; if (MarketInfo(GBPUSDsym, MODE_BID) &lt;= iLow(GBPUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, iLowest(GBPUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_LOW, 24, 0))) ShortBiasCount += 1; else if (MarketInfo(GBPUSDsym, MODE_ASK) &gt;= iHigh(GBPUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, iHighest(GBPUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_HIGH, 24, 0))) LongBiasCount += 1; if (MarketInfo(AUDUSDsym, MODE_BID) &lt;= iLow(AUDUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, iLowest(AUDUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_LOW, 24, 0))) ShortBiasCount += 1; else if (MarketInfo(AUDUSDsym, MODE_ASK) &gt;= iHigh(AUDUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, iHighest(AUDUSDsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_HIGH, 24, 0))) LongBiasCount += 1; if (MarketInfo(USDCHFsym, MODE_BID) &lt;= iLow(USDCHFsym, PERIOD_H1, iLowest(USDCHFsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_LOW, 24, 0))) ShortBiasCount += 1; else if (MarketInfo(USDCHFsym, MODE_ASK) &gt;= iHigh(USDCHFsym, PERIOD_H1, iHighest(USDCHFsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_HIGH, 24, 0))) LongBiasCount += 1; if (MarketInfo(USDJPYsym, MODE_BID) &lt;= iLow(USDJPYsym, PERIOD_H1, iLowest(USDJPYsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_LOW, 24, 0))) ShortBiasCount += 1; else if (MarketInfo(USDJPYsym, MODE_ASK) &gt;= iHigh(USDJPYsym, PERIOD_H1, iHighest(USDJPYsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_HIGH, 24, 0))) LongBiasCount += 1; if (MarketInfo(USDCADsym, MODE_BID) &lt;= iLow(USDCADsym, PERIOD_H1, iLowest(USDCADsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_LOW, 24, 0))) ShortBiasCount += 1; else if (MarketInfo(USDCADsym, MODE_ASK) &gt;= iHigh(USDCADsym, PERIOD_H1, iHighest(USDCADsym, PERIOD_H1, MODE_HIGH, 24, 0))) LongBiasCount += 1; if (LongBiasCount &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; LongBiasCount &gt; ShortBiasCount) { BiasString = "LONG"; } else if (ShortBiasCount &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; ShortBiasCount &gt; LongBiasCount) { BiasString = "SHORT"; } return(0); } All 4 versions contain the more generic form of handling symbol string mangling. Inserted Code string AddMangle = ""; if (StringLen(Symbol()) &gt; 6) AddMangle = StringSubstr(Symbol(), 6); rather than Inserted Code string AddChar = ""; if (StringLen(Symbol()) == 7) AddChar = StringSubstr(Symbol(), 6, 1); I hope that's not too much "Expert Advisor crap" for anyone.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Thx MetaCoder Your help is really appreciated.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
madscalp, you're welcome, you seem to really understand the strategy, as does eTrader, so I'll be looking at your guys' posts to refine the EAs. I believe I'm in synch with what you are doing but I do have my own take on determining long/short bias.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Does EA attached to EU Chart can place order on Cable? (I don't think so) Or it must be place on each and every pair chart?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
You place it on ANY chart (only one chart) and it trades all six pairs.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
wow, ok, need to test this next week.. Too many versions though not sure which one to choose. Will start from Ver 4, thanks

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Of course What do you think about the using of 6 pairs-WRVIM to launch trades ? It's possible to you to incorporate this indy in the EA ?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
madscalp, I think I could do that. I'm not familiar with WRVIM so there would be considerable development time for me, unless someone has already coded a multi-pair version of it that I can readily use in my EAs.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I can pretty easily use conventional indicators on all six currency pairs, then wrap some math/logic around them to come up with composite values that drive the long/short bias decision. That's what I'm doing now in version 04. I picked breaks above/below 24-hour highs/lows. If 3 or more pairs are breaking in one direction, that is the bias. This seems straightforward and intuitive to me, and I won't be surprised if it works as well as anything.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
OK I understand. We are going to test your EA next week. Good week-end.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
? I'm trying to run in strat tester V3 an can't get it to work. Is it cause it has to take 6 trades ? Thx

--- 帖子 #395 ---
The backtester works on EAs where the only currency traded is the one corresponding to the chart it's attached to, and they EA only refers to that symbol via the Symbol() function.

I can go through and find out hit rates on all the prs traded to get winloss ratio of each pr and see if its profitable long run

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Forward-testing is the only practical way to get an idea.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
true 1m data ain't the best but its just a faster way to have an idea if its worth the chase. It sounds good but need a good idea to attempt a forward as forwards take forever. Thx anyway

Patience is required.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Indeed ! Hello MC, The first "3" version as well as the Confirm14 EA were not really to my liking. It's just this "thing" about EA's suffering losses going out of the gate for the first time. I will continue to upgrade and test. Perhaps you could include an option as to which pairs to allow to trade. Regards, TR

--- 帖子 #401 ---
ps...... perhaps you could say hello to Looser for me. The two of you seem to be fairly close. Trade Well.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
It's all greek or crap but as long as it works. thanks metacoder

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Well if you believe that cruising the threads and running backtests against EAs is a good way to find solid strategies, good luck with that. You should be looking at the forward testing being posted by a couple of the traders here, then figure out if the EA is matching what those guys do. Backtests have misled so many people, including yours truly. I ditched them long ago and I don't miss them.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
MetaCoder, I will be very happy to forward test your "crap". Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hmmmmmmmmmmm

After i read this thread in the beginning till the end, finally i found something important...thanks looser very nice education you share....

--- 帖子 #407 ---
just signing into the thread

--- 帖子 #408 ---
That option is always there, in the form of modifying the source code to suit your own purposes.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
The backtests are a way of seeing potential for an EA. This is pretty cut and dry system here. You could run one pr at a time and do the math to get a quick idea if its worth forward testing. Also if you have bought true data like some of us its not missleading at all it will truly let you know if your EA can work. True tick data is still slow much slower than a strat tester,but a true reading it will let you know quickly.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi all. Thanks too Looser for another headache I think it's have a really strong potential. But maybe it'll be better if basket contains only non-correlated pairs? In other words - only pairs those correlation between each other equals 0(zero) or close to it. Correct me pls, if I wrong. p.s - forgive me my english, it's not my native language.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi MyxoMop! Of course, it's up to Looser, but I was thinking about that too. But I don't think we can find 5-6 totally non-correlated pairs. Which pairs would you suggest? P.S. I like your nick!

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I trying to find such pairs with Correlation indicator (attached). Then, I'll analyze - can my suggestion improve Looser's system performance, or it's... just bad suggestion. P.s. - thanks! Like your nick too, it tells me that you originally Russian

--- 帖子 #413 ---
MyxoMop, thank you, it looks like a very interesting indicator! P.S. Yes, I came to the US from Belorussia.

Trade size (Lot). I think almost any pair in system must have different lots amount, depending on it's ADR. Normalization of daily ranges via lots size can equate weights of movement size for all pairs. Hmm... I hope that's clear explanation. Otherwise, part of profit depend on faster pair moves.

5 digit brokers see stop loss 30 as 3.. so 30x10 looks like 30 to them. settings for stop loss and slippage need to be 300....

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Reading your posts... here's an experiment you may (or may not) want to try. Open a chart for 24 of the "better known" currency pairs. Just prior to 00 GMT you would place a trade on all 24 pairs. Have an ADR indicator attached to your charts. The stop loss for your trades is ADR divided by 4. The take profit is the stop loss value plus 10 pips (a SL of 32 pips and TP of 42 pips, for example). Therefore, you can use the same lot size on all trades because the TP's and SL;s will all vary Typically, there will be 15 to 18 pairs that move one direction and the balance will move the other. The goal then is to choose the right direction for the "larger basket" of pairs. Of course, you will likely be stopped out on some regardless of the direction due to ranging conditions. Needless to say, it is helpful to get some of the more volatile pairs right as well. AUD/CAD AUD/JPY CHF/JPY GBP/JPY EUR/JPY NZD/JPY USD/JPY AUD/USD EUR/USD GBP/USD EUR/GBP NZD/USD USD/CHF AUD/CHF NZD/CHF The above pairs moved one direction and below moved the opposite GBP/CAD USD/CAD EUR/CHF AUD/NZD GBP/CHF EUR/AUD EUR/CAD EUR/NZD GBP/NZD That is one example of the pairs that moved together (it is only one example and will not always hold true). You should be able to place the entire set of trades in less than 30 minutes, maybe half that if you're fast with your calculations and you can catch the added move that often happens at the open of the new daily candle. Be advised that if you lose every trade (unlikely) your loss will be in excess of 650 pips. My best win to date has been +202 pips. The worst loss was the one time I attempted this just prior to NY open and lost 157 pips. If you could average a gain of just 20 pips per day it would be 30 minutes well spent. If I am cluttering this thread with useless information according to the owner's criteria then.... all apologies. Regards

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Am watching this thread with great interest. Thank you for the open discussion. A well chosen basket of pairs makes the most sense I have seen yet for trading forex.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Yes, I agree. It's the same thing what I'm talking about. Well, if originally Looser's system strongly not imply such normalization, my apologies too. Will test forward anyway.

Don't bet too much on currency correlation, cause correlation does change. In one thread earlier we made great effort trying make some kind of a system trading correlated pairs, at the end it's all fail. For example as for now JPY and CHF at their highest levels and further correlation of those pairs won't stay the same for long. But of course for short term trades it could be useful.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
im also with a 5 digit broker and the EA won't open trades. it mentions that it is opening a trade, but there's nothing in the journal (good or errors). i did change the slippage and s/l to 300. what else could be wrong?

In this thread only I got some link for Currency Ring ... and I found it very interesting.... I am just posting some text from that link.... ____________________________________________________________ Each ring consists of 3 pairs. Each ring consists of 3 currencies. For example, if we take the following ring: GBP/JPY GBP/CHF CHF/JPY We can see that we have 3 currencies present in this ring namely GBP, CHF and JPY. Now when we are buying the GBP/CHF and the GBP/JPY, we are infact also buying the cross pair CHF/JPY as well.. So, we have to actually also open a buy position on the CHF/JPY pair as well to stabilise the account. For example: 1. You buy 1 lot GBP/JPY 2. You buy 1 lot GBP/CHF 3. You also have to buy 0.8 lots of CHF/JPY in order to stabilise the accounts After we have done this, we wait for the currencies to move and when we decide to take some profits, we close all the orders altogether. The aim is not to make profits from each individual trades, but to make an overall profit from all the 3 trades together... You should use the ADR, Average Daily Range indicator to know how much the pair has already moved before entering into the trades. You dont want to trade a currency ring when all the 3 pairs has already move beyond their 75% daily range... The best spot is when the currencies has moves 25% of the daily range, then you open your trades and wait for the currencies to reach the 50%-75% daily range before closing your trades... You should not be waiting for a fixed profit level to be reached, you should just be satisfied with whatever you are getting and get out of the trades. You can use an equity trailing EA which will trail the overall profits on the account. Trailing the entire account profit is better than trailing individual orders separately. The best currency ring to trade are those that has the most activity is the GBP/USD, USD/JPY and GBP/JPY. As you can see, all the 3 currencies present in this ring are the Big Movers of the market. It is advised that you trade only 1 currency ring per account as this will decrease undue drawdown that your balance can suffer with these type of strategies. It is also better in the sense that you will be able to study the behaviour of each ring separately and may better assess their performance. You should always start with very small lots initially... for example, if you have a 10,000usd account, you can start with 0.10 lots and then increase it as your balance increases. Compounding your earnings is among the best ways to increase your profits and grow your account. ____________________________________________________________ Is there any EA present for such currency ring trading? Anybody tested this strategy?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
I also trade with a 5 digit broker and the EA works fine. No need to change SL or slippage - the EA recognizes and compensates for the digit difference. If you are testing the 04 version, I believe it waits for specific conditions to be met before opening the trades. My 04 demo also has not opened any trades for that reason. Another possible reason for not opening trades could be that all the traded pairs are not showing in the Market Watch window. Siince the EA is attached to only 1 chart, the other pairs must be in the Market Watch window for the EA to obtain the prices. Just right click in the window and select Show All.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
where can i find 0.4 or 0.5? im using 0.3 right now

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I don't know if there's an EA for it but one could be coded easily enough. Have you tested this strategy? I question the lot sizing and pair selection. What if GBP experiences a severe weakness? We bought 2 lots of GBP. Buying 0.8 lot of CHFJPY won't prevent a potential severe drawdown.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Post 384, page 26

--- 帖子 #428 ---
im using 03 right now, but it doesn't open anything, version 04 doesnt either. i do have all pairs visible in the market watch window. do i need to attach it to a chart with specific timeframe (i thought not?). and where is version 05, which is mentioned at first page?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Correlations and confirmations are quite different. Correlation in my mind is how two pairs move similarly (or not), taking any inverse relationship into account. For example, EURUSD and USDCHF are often strongly correlated (we take an inverse relationship into account in this case). Some traders watch for when pairs are more or less correlated and try to predict future expected adjustments they can take advantage of. Confirmation to me is seeing a single currency get strong or weak not against just one other currency, but against more than one. For example if GBPUSD, GBPJPY and GBPCHF all fall together, it means GBP weakness is confirmed across three currencies (USD, JPY and CHF).

--- 帖子 #430 ---
There is not yet an 05 to my knowledge. If you downloaded 03 from MetaCoder's first post, you need to re download it from post 384 - he corrected some coding errors. That may be your problem. Otherwise, I don't know how to help you. The time frame of the chart makes no difference. I am using H1 only because that's the one that comes up by default. One last thing to check is the setting for MinMiniEquity and MinStdEquity. The default for mini is 500 and for std is 10,000. If you are trading a standard account with only 5000 balance/equity the EA will not open trades due to low equity level. I trade a $5000 standard account so I have changed it to 500.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Forgot to address version 04. That version uses some combination of 24 hour highs/lows, which I don't fully understand, to determine when and in what direction to open trades. My 04 demo has also not opened any trades, I presume because the conditions have not been met. My 03 version is working very well. It opened the 6 trades and 2 pairs have hit their first SL and reopened in the opposite direction. Now all trades are positive and equity is $70 above LastFlatEquity so the trailing stop should be in effect. We should soon see what the outcome will be.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
And remember, you can always close trades manually at your discretion. If you do, I recommend disabling the EA first just to make absolutely certain it won't open new trades as you close them all.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hi frazerd Could you post your set with 03 and a standard account $ 5 000 ? No trades for me ....

Mr. eTrader can you please share your secrete of success?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hey i am testing this strategy...

--- 帖子 #437 ---
eTrader you are really a genuine trader !!!!! No Words for you !!!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I use all the default settings except for MinStdEquity is 500 rather than 10000 and I currently have OpenHour set to 13 and CloseHour set to 17. I am opening short with BiasShort true and BiasLong false. I had a lot of activity yesterday and more this morning, but have not had time to analyze the results. Will report results later today.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Ver 05 is the same as ver 04 but with no time criteria for entries and exits. Also see ver 06. Same as version 05 except: No minimum equity needed to trade. No trailing stop. Back to only updating last flat balance/equity on increases. Profit will be taken if EA profit is 1.0% above last flat equity. LongBiasCount and ShortBiasCount compared to 2, not 3 -- we are looking for some prevailing directional action, not much, before we open any trades. No time basis for opening and closing (as with version 05).

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Forgot to add that I trade at 500:1 leverage with GoMarkets , so I change MaxMarginToUse to 0.2 rather than the default 1.0

--- 帖子 #441 ---
In order to be better able to analyze my results, I always sort the Account History by closing time and copy the info from my account statement into a Excell spreadsheet. Here is the Looser_03 analysis with my comments along the right side.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Been doing some forward with some older versions and was looking at the new ones and noticed the inputs to trade either long or short is gone. I have been picking my direction and think it has potential but the v5 I am looking at sells only. I'm I missing something ?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Yes, you are missing something. Version 05 only opens trades when and in the direction that MetaCoder's criteria dictate. If you want to determine time and direction for opening trades you need to use version 03. Also, check my analysis of that version above and make appropriate adjustments. The different versions each do things a little differently. The latest version is not necessarily the only one you want to use. You need to keep up with MetaCoder's posts to see what each version does and which one you want to use.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Are you sure this EA is working for 5 digits broker ? No trade.... Please could you post a set for that ?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Well not sure about certain criteria it took trades when it was dropped just like the other I was using. Also stats look great but all sells. I trade pretty well but like the idea of spreading risk a little. I think this could be nice for sure.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Same with version 04.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
See this post, it could apply to you.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Was your statement generated with the newer 03 from this post? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=384 If not, it could explain some of the odd things you were seeing.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Yes, it is the latest 03.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
After analysing it, I don't think it is odd things I'm seeing. I think the EA is doing exactly what it was designed to do. I think the "odd" things are a result of the InitProfitMultiple, ProfitMultipleTrail and the market action. Looks to me like the trail settings need to be adjusted to prevent the "odd" things. I have changed InitProfitMultiple to 1.05 and ProfitMultipleTrail to .005. That should give some different results when the EA starts trading again at OpenHour 13 tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I think you want InitProfitMultiple at 1.01 not 1.05.

You test these indicators on the history? The results are very contradictory. Or do you think that the entry can only be done based on their signals. Sorry for bad English ...

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Maybe read the thread and get up to speed on the strategy rather than focus on the usage of indicators.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
The statement suggests I'm using version 04, but that EA wasn't opening trades due to its strict entry criteria. The trades in the statement were generated with version 06.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Congratulations MetaCoder Your EAs are working fine.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Thanks madscalp.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
@metacoder, i'm backtesting #5 on eur/usd but it doesn't seem to open any trades. i like the idea of playing it safe just to build my equity first.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Ver 05 also has strict entry criteria such that trades would only be opened on rare occasions. Ver 06 should give more frequent trades.

I think the thread-starter wants the EA talk off of his thread. Thanks for the strategy suggestion Looser and others who gave it a whirl. I think EAs are best discussed elsewhere. Cutting over to here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...36#post3976836 for further EA talk. __ And this thread being downgraded to 4 stars is almost criminal. I guess very few are really paying attention and using their minds. A shame.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
No problem brutha-man. I like the strategy you introduced here and fully automatic trading is just my way. I think the forum moderators want to keep my stuff tucked under Platform Tech even though I'm really more about the big picture than just implementing EAs.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
HOW BIZARRE !!! You request traders to apply this system manually and in the next post it's No! No! No! I love EA's while MC loves EA's but is now more about "the big picture than just implementing EA's" It's all good !

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I think Looser wants others to try eTrader's manual method to see if his success can be duplicated. For me, placing orders with visible stops and visible pending orders is less desirable than keeping those things hidden and handled with an EA's logic. The essence of the strategy is good I think and each of us will have our own way of trading it. I always think automation, that's just me.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Looser is right. There should be room for both. I like to test both; the manual and the automatic. It is good to keep an open mind.

@metacoder, #6 ea traded today. usd/cad hit the SL and opened a new position. It's +11 pips now which is good. However, is it possible to have some sort of multiplier for the lot size for the rebound to be slightly more effective? let me know guys if this is workable. Example: SL = 30 Lot size = 0.01 Recovery SL= 20 lot size = 0.02 ----------------------- this way we could have an extern variable closeatrecovery= true (obviously calculated by price) false if they still want to aim for profit. true if they want a lower draw down overall percentage. trailing profit would be a nice addition too (just to protect the basket)

--- 帖子 #498 ---
The latest weeks have been particularly good for breakout systems (as we can see for the FSP method of trading). We cannot say the same for the previous period. I would be really careful to judge enthusiastically this system based only on the most recent results.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I am testing strategy mentioned on following post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=423

--- 帖子 #500 ---
In looking at eTrader's usage of the RVI indicator, it appears he is looking for crosses where a majority of the crosses indicate either long or short. I'll see if I can explain it more detail as I examine it further. Notice that his bottom chart is a "weighted RVI multipair". Need technical details on that. __ All right, so after some quick research, I calculate the multipair RVI like this: Inserted Code EURUSD_rvi = iRVI(EURUSDsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_MAIN, 0); EURUSD_rviSignal = iRVI(EURUSDsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_SIGNAL, 0); GBPUSD_rvi = iRVI(GBPUSDsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_MAIN, 0); GBPUSD_rviSignal = iRVI(GBPUSDsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_SIGNAL, 0); AUDUSD_rvi = iRVI(AUDUSDsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_MAIN, 0); AUDUSD_rviSignal = iRVI(AUDUSDsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_SIGNAL, 0); USDCHF_rvi = iRVI(USDCHFsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_MAIN, 0); USDCHF_rviSignal = iRVI(USDCHFsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_SIGNAL, 0); USDJPY_rvi = iRVI(USDJPYsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_MAIN, 0); USDJPY_rviSignal = iRVI(USDJPYsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_SIGNAL, 0); USDCAD_rvi = iRVI(USDCADsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_MAIN, 0); USDCAD_rviSignal = iRVI(USDCADsym, PERIOD_M15, 10, MODE_SIGNAL, 0); SixPair_rvi = (EURUSD_rvi+GBPUSD_rvi+AUDUSD_rvi+USDCHF_rvi+USDJPY_rvi+USDCAD_rvi) / 6; SixPair_rviSignal = (EURUSD_rviSignal+GBPUSD_rviSignal+AUDUSD_rviSignal+ USDCHF_rviSignal+USDJPY_rviSignal+USDCAD_rviSignal) / 6; The six-pair RVI signal line rising above the main RVI indicates a bias to open all long, and the signal line falling below main RVI indicates a bias to open all short.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Looser, Why didn't u open the trade in the following order since the pairs are moving in opposite direction. Buy - EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD Sell - USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF BuyStop - USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF SellStop - EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD

--- 帖子 #502 ---
If you want to try trading like eTrader but with fully automatic means, the closest to it that I have so far would be LooserKissMe_09, available here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...36&amp;postcount=1 In the spirit of how the forum moderators organize the subforums, let's keep discussion of the EA in that thread, not here. In a little while I'll discuss THE STRATEGY and ITS TACTICS right here on this thread. Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Let's look at the six pairs traded as two groups of three. One group has USD on the right. EURUSD GBPUSD AUDUSD The other group has USD on the left. USDCHF USDJPY USDCAD This means that if you trade all six pairs on one direction, you have entered a loose hedge situtation because you have three pairs that will tend to rise as USD strengthens or weakens, and another set of three pairs that will tend to sink as USD strengthens or weakens. The six non-USD currencies are unique: EUR, GBP, AUD, CHF, JPY and CAD. Forum member Looser split them into two groups and called them the husbands and the wives, which is amusing. Anyway, notice that do not try to set up a pure synthetic hedge. We have a "loose" hedge, though. We could keep these trades open in one direction quite a while, and would probably come into profit eventually purely due to the diversification. Sometimes we would see a floating loss, but other times things could very well go in our favor. There is no way of knowing which way it will go after we enter the trades. Looser proposed a tactical framework for trying to gain profit without waiting too long, which I always like to see. He proposed that we put 30-pip stops on each trade, and reverse each trade just one time if the stop is hit. The reversal trades would also have 30-pip stops. Then, we simply wait until our equity rises above where it was at the previous high watermark and close for profit when we see fit, or until the second set of stops are hit for a loss. This is a simple tactical framework. Taking the idea and running with it, eTrader defined entry criteria which he appears to apply in a disciplined way. At London open, he looks at a weighted six-pair relative vigor index (RVI) to determine his overall long or short bias. This should often give an edge for getting the basket into profit sooner. Then, as far as I can tell, he stays within the tactical framework. I hope I have accurately represented what is going on here, and that it helps someone. Good trades to you all.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
eTrader, where are you are?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
The trade entry you propose banks entirely on USD weakness. Going all long or all short is a much more balanced entry situation.

--- 帖子 #506 ---

how do you manage the MM ? the tp is at 1% of the total order value. but the stoploss is at 30 pips and we can have max 12 stoplosses in a day. so how do you arrive at lotsize ? can somebody give me the proper lotsize at 10000$ account ? my max loss in a day cant exceed 5% of account thanks

--- 帖子 #516 ---
That depends on your Stop Loss. If Stop loss is 50 pips then 0.20 lot 1 trade will have potential loss of $100 which is 1% of the account Go from there. Depends how many trades you taking a day and your Stop Loss.

This above post explains the system the best. I have some thoughts. *************************************************** I would like to say this system is effectively paying 90 pips (3 * stop losses) for information in order to gauge the likely direction of currency pairs in a given day. Bit like paying to see an opponents card By longing the market in all 6 pairs this 'anti-hedge' only lasts for a 30 pip period. The system then hopes the direction of the markets will still be net long for that day. However there are flaws a) Many times after an early rally in London open, price reverses expecially with early news events. This then will take out initially 3 stops followed by 6 more. 9*30 = 270 pip loss b) When do you close a trade? I cannot see how this can be automated due to many external factors. In order to be profitable with this system it really needs a trader to manually close trades c) Markets whipsaw on purpose to shake out the small fry traders, after the initial anti hedge of 90 pips is paid, the trades you will have open effectively have 3*60 stop losses and 3*30 stop losses. In some currencies this small stop loss will often be taken out as price will whip back and forth. The last point I see is why the need for the 'anti-hedge ' to start with? Would it not be easier to have buy/sell order in place for the first 3 out the 6 currencies to go +30 pips after the London open? Saves the initial outlay of losing 90 pips. You are also still hoping that the direction of the markets still gos your way.

Will there be times this has less than all 6 pairs open? I seem to have lost one overnight lol. Thanks

I've been following this thread for a few days now. Waiting eagerly for Loosers results he promised to post on Sep 5 That Currency Ring strat is also intersting

Here's the script for people using ECN Brokers, which can also be used by people using non-ECN brokers. It's the Micro Lot version attached, but you can change the lot size anyway. Also attached is the same thing but just with my Money Management code. Since we are trading 6 currencies at any one time, my MM code splits the lot into 6 smaller lots. EDIT: I've put my own version of the AutoProfitManager (EA) [ *** updated - please re-download *** ] It just requires you enter a percentage of account balance growth that you want to achieve. Defaults to 2% growth expectation. Cheers, the-game.

This is my terminal at the moment... using WRVIM-Looser indi for entry off the H4 chart. Long bias when main crosses up the signal Short bias when main crosses down the signal

--- 帖子 #537 ---
the-game, Thanks. I will test it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Thanks. So far I have already found some shortcomings: 1. The lot size in my MM should be split into 12 smaller lots because the pending orders may be triggered. We have to take this into account as this is the worst case scenario using this system. Obviously, to take advantage of the MM, you need a big enough account as my MM code can only spit out the minimum lot size allowed per trade, which is usually 0.01 2. Changing the timeframe when the AutoProfitManager is on will reset the starting account balance number. I will have to look into using global variables. Also, my logic to trigger to close all orders was incorrect. --- WATCH THIS SPACE --- See attached. 1. The script now allows you to choose to split the MM calculated lots into smaller lots. Also lets you specify how many split lots you want. For this system I suggest: 12 = Normal, 6 = Aggressive. 2. AutoProfitManager now uses Global Variables and the logic to trigger to close all orders has been fixed. Cheers, the-game. P.S. - I'm testing this system with the currency ring theory. GBPUSD, USDJPY, GBPJPY - Using WRVIM with these three pairs for initial direction

--- 帖子 #539 ---
why are we reinventing the wheel ? meta coder has already provided us the EA and everyone is using that. bigger issue is how to make the system profitable ? how to backtest this ? what could be the ideal SL levels for each pair. anyother trigger other than RVI ?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hello Skyzerfx, -Open 6 charts TF M15 (eurusd, gbpusd, audusd, usdchf, usdjpy, usdcad) -Place the normal RVI(10) indicator below each chart. -Open 1 chart TF M15 (eurusd) -Place the indicator W_RVIM(10) below the chart. -Minimize all 7 charts -Place the 7 indicator windows under each other from top to bottom. (The one at the bottom is the Weighted RVI MultiPairs(6) or W_RVIM) eTrader,

--- 帖子 #541 ---
All pairs in 1 indicator window Another method is using the indicator W_RVIM as a normal RVI indicator for each pair. -Open eurusd chart TF M15 -place the W_RVIM(10) indicator in the indicator window -drag and drop the other W_RVIM indicators in the same indicator window -adjust the W_RVIM indicators: (Fixed Min, Fixed Max/NumberPairs /Pairs1,2,3,4,5,6 /colors/ Levels (0) -Place the indicator W_RVIM(10) in the same indicator window (Main W_RVIM and W_RVIM signal line) Long trade : Vertical line (LimeGreen) Main W_RVIM line and W_RVIM Signal Line below the horizontal zero line The main W_RVIM line (white) is crossing up the W_RVIM signal line (dotted white) Look also at the individual pairs. Examples: see pictures eTrader

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Is somebody still using that system? How is it going? Any results? Best regards!

--- 帖子 #547 ---
hi all ... howz the system going ?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
It's kind of a loser method.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Right on !

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Looser, you mentioned in the early portion of this thread (when it was still alive), when someone asked you for your results, that you would share them September 5. You did not share them September 5. In fact, you have never once on this thread shared your results. Why?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
system is not work!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
So that is why Looser never posted his results? He knew it was a "looser" system but let people keep on trying to make it work? Is that why he was banned from his own thread?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Well if you take the positive side ... then see eTrader results ... he never had a single loss approx. ....

--- 帖子 #554 ---
It depends who is trading .. and ofcourse 95% ...........

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Again, the question is, where are YOUR results? Are you not the one putting out these systems for people to examine? Did you EVER post ONE result? I'm just curious...

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Right, why not divulge which group YOU are in? Are you in the 95% with your own systems? If not, let's see your results.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Dude ... lemme tell you the truth ... I am really very "HAPPY" .. and I always was wondering and cursing that why HAPPY people are so greedy that they don't tell anyone anything ... Now I realized HAPPINESS mustn't be shared !!! I am happy ... let everyone get their own HAPPINESS ....

--- 帖子 #558 ---
That's wonderful, Loser, so glad you are happy. Say, how did this trading system(s) go that you've posted here? Just curious to know how you have done with your own systems. Any success at all?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hello looser, Really nice to see you after so long time. Well howz your system is doing? There is no point to blame on looser system. Phantom trading idea is based on looser trading system only. Thanx for your trading system. Regards, 24hrs.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I'm a beginner at forex and is using fxcm trading station demo account. The above quote is from the emotion and greed style system. Can anyone explain to me what does it mean? doesn't make any sense to me. Thanks

--- 帖子 #561 ---
DREAMLINER !!! I tell you I got the success !!! and ONE thing is for HELL SURE ... DAMN SURE !!!! The HOLY GRAIL is within your brain NOT in any indicator or trading system !!! TRAIN the BRAIN !!!! I have developed an indicator !!! This indicator is installed in human brain .. there are very specific set of rules !! Once you've trained your neurons or you can say once your brain has set rhythm with market ... the accuracy would be like HELL !!!!! There is a special way to see visualize and feel the market with specific set of rules !!! Anybody has human brain can install this indicator within his brain !!! Soon I will BOMBARD this !!!

--- 帖子 #562 ---
You talk the good talk. But where are the results? Your human brain indicator is all well and good but dreamliner asked you to produce results for the system posted. Since you dont and all you post is worthless double talk, I would asume you are in that this system is in the 95% loser catagory.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
lolz ... i love u for that!!!

--- 帖子 #564 ---
That's wonderful to hear. I am so sorry your system here did not work out for you, but look forward to you sharing your new system. Should we call the new system "the Brain" system?

--- 帖子 #565 ---
That's wonderful to hear. I am so sorry your system here did not work out for you, but look forward to you sharing your new system. Should we call the new system "the Brain" system? http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s.../yim/happy.gif Look man I know the system aint that great but give the guy a break. if he doesnt wana show his results then thats up to him. theres 100's of systems here on forex that fail but the creator shouldnt get ripped for trying. HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
The system I posted didn't fail ..... I bet didn't fail !!!!!! .... Why I didn't post result because eTrader was posting successfully ... and also i was and am working hard on the next level !!!!

--- 帖子 #567 ---
You do realize, of course, that etrader was not using your system, right? But that's ok, I started a thread awhile back and didn't want to post my results either, as it was a loser system too.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
can anyone change the LooserTradingSystem script which is here in the first post (3 scripts for micro mini &amp; Standard lots): http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=249386 and change the Stop Loss to none means no Stop Loss .. and make the Take Profit at 30 pips ... and remain every thing same ...

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Unbelievable! It's work!!! So sad that i'm find this top so late... 5 days ago... Dear Looser!!! Where are you??? If you change the direction &amp; strategy please give me the link!!! I'm your fan now and i't no joke!!! Anybody help if you know where Looser is now &amp; where "Quake Forum" Thnks!

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Dear We haven't changed the direction and strategy ... it really works ... One of the FATHER of technical analysis the most famous person Richard Dennis who and his students earned MILLIONS, once said:: "even If I publish my rules on newspaper people wont follow them" So the KEY is consistency ... Discipline ... you can see here only eTrader showed discipline ... the others are just criticizing ... WHY ? because 95% cannot follow ... and those 5% are just quietly following .... DISCIPLINE CONSISTENCY !!!!!!!!!!!! dear !!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I like your system, you always mention in your philosophy rhino hyena n why you choose them not much else ... philosophy is very precise with this system and I like it thank you ... do you have EA 4 this system ... ? nfp news need this EA coz save n quickly response 4 the market ... good luck

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Hello I just finished reading the thread and it seems that the best time is 15 min prior to London opening and close all of them 1 h later. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Follow ETrader !!!

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I think for Forward test ... there is no need for an EA.... on first post you can download scripts that you can use to APPLY whole system with in 7 seconds... no need to understand too much detail... just apply scripts !!! see results !!! thats all !!!

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I give up, searched whole thread, can someone point me where i can get the Weighted RVI multi pair indicator

thanks for link iamthat. dont know how i missed it.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
looked at this a bit. one day profit, next day loss. like the idea of basket trading. cud be a set and forget type of trading. the prob here is the pairs. they are non correlated. 3 go in diff direction than the other 3. someone pointed this out earlier. need to trade a few correlated pairs. six pair is not a magic number, but prob near the ideal. i will try to come up with six corr pairs later for us to try. comments please.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hi Just started to test this method. Will post results when available. wonder why this thread is going quiet.....

--- 帖子 #466 ---
ok...opened the 6 pairs short at 9:24am sydney time. +30pips unrealised as I write this (11:57am). Anyone still testing this out?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Does this loser mean "loser" and not 'looser'?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Been out and just got back. Closed all remaining trades (open and pending). Only 3 pairs open: uj, au &amp; eu Total Pips: +13. I didn't use any scripts or EAs. This was my first test and I opened all manually. Still going thru the thread. Will test it with metacoder's LooserKissMe_01 EA tomorrow and see how it goes. This time I'll open it before London session.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I developed my own method.. and it inspired from this method and phantom 6. Thanx to all.... and looser.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I am posting three indicators from T101 method adjusted for pairs used here. Hope one can make use of it in entry timing. I have no specific suggestion on how to use it as of now. IamTHAT, In your many posts have you described how to change the number of pairs included in the WRVIM? How do i add pairs. How do i subtract pairs. Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
These are the original indicators which has 14 pairs. You can add or delete pairs externally from mt4, or modify them in the code (right click, modify). These looser pairs roughly represent GBPJPY, AUDCAD and EURCHF. What to make of it, I don't know. if you succeed in making them work in any way, let us know!

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I am looking for a same script but to buyopen one pair with pending stop order and inversely a script to sellopen. I would be interesting to add a profittarget. Thank you very much for your help!

--- 帖子 #473 ---
i there, i have being trying amazing ea sometime ago but has stoped working, something to do with error 130. is there a way to fix this at all. thanks erksy.

Hello Q-Trader, Did you developed a EA for this system? If yes can you please share with me? Have a nice day

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi there , is it possible for someone to make a current version st all . Anybody ,pls.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Was testing this system using the script Open_Looser_6_Pairs. Totally random entries. Closing when overall in profit. Result screen shot

Anyone still trading or testing this method?

Chaos isn't random at all, disorder is trend like. We call it chaos but things become more disordered according to definable equations. The universe is a never ending downtrend and intelligent life are the value buyers fighting back. Eventually balance will be achieved.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I see that the theme is from 2014 but I find these indicator very useful. I have downloaded them long ago and now discovered them again, but they aren't working in the new version( current version) of Build on MT4. I'm interested actually in the attached file ( W_RVIM.mq4 ) - will it be possible to repair or correct the file, so that it would work in the current version of MT4 ? Thanks a lot!
