Hi, After several weeks of succesfull trading with this method, i decide to post it because I'm sure that some of you can find it helpful and others can improve it. You can find the method in the pdf attached. Feel free to test it and all your remarks, opinions are welcome. Thanks 8/08/2006 - a new version of the pdf thanks to the comments

Short GBP/USD @ 1.9065 - Stop @ 1.9106 Exit @ 1.9035. Profit : +30 Pips This method gives you mecanicals trades. Don't hesitate to transform them into a discretionnay trade after because you can see things that the system can't. Sometimes, it will be the difference between a 30 pips trade and a 300 pips trade.

Well, you doesn't follow the rules... NonLagMa is tomato after blue dots appears.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
What are you settings for the nonlagma because mine is yellow http://www.tlatomi.com/blog/images/graph.gif

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This is the mine

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I don't know what's wrong but i upload my template so you can try it with my settings.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Judex001 - Thanks for the interesting method. I look forward to testing it. I'm glad I caught it on the first day because I predict a HUGE thread!

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Judex001 This looks interesting, will look forward on testing it myself. Thanks

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks for the addition of a promising new indicator. Seems like we never get enough of the good ones! Any addit info regarding setting stops, actual W/L history, etc would be appreciated. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hey, Thnx Judex001 for posting this. Have you tried testing it on any other currency pair in the weeks that you have had it? I am currently backtesting on EurUsd and also USDJPY to see how it performs, doing some forward testing on EurUsd too. Seems great

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Does it matter what order the three indicators happen in? For example, right now in the GBP/USD, the non-lag happened first, then the cross over and then the blue dot. Jason

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Looks like a nifty little system ... looking forward to errrr forward testing it...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Judex001 I have one sugestion, is there a way you or someone on the forum can create an alarm signal to sound when the blue or red dot appear on the chart. That would be helpful so you wouldn't have to stay by the computer waiting for the dots to show up. All you need would be to hear the sound and that would give you the option to monitor your chart and wait to see if the CCI crosses the trigger line and if the NonLagMa color changes to yellow. Also it would alert you to exit the trade.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
also it's possible an sms/email alert.

Carmel : Regarding the stops, I generaly take the high of the previous bars. I live in canada so unfortunately i can't trade at 8:00 AM european time so i lost a lot of good opportunities but for the last month, on the cable, the results are : Total : 6 trades - 4 winning and 2 losing Profit : 451 pips &lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cols="5" frame="void" rules="groups"&gt; &lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width="85"&gt;&lt;col width="86"&gt;&lt;col width="86"&gt;&lt;col width="86"&gt;&lt;col width="86"&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="center" height="17" width="85"&gt; GBP/USD &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="center" width="86"&gt; Enter &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="center" width="86"&gt; Stop &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="center" width="86"&gt; Exit &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="center" width="86"&gt; P/L &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td sdval="38904" sdnum="2058;0;DD/MM/AA" align="center" height="17"&gt; 06/07/06 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8369" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8369 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8343" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8343 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8493" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8493 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="124" sdnum="2058;0;0" align="center"&gt; 124 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td sdval="38908" sdnum="2058;0;DD/MM/AA" align="center" height="17"&gt; 10/07/06 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8396" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8396 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8517" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8517 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8413" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8413 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="-17.0000000000003" sdnum="2058;0;0" align="center"&gt; -17 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td sdval="38909" sdnum="2058;0;DD/MM/AA" align="center" height="17"&gt; 11/07/06 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8457" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8457 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8364" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8364 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8447" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8447 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="-9.9999999999989" sdnum="2058;0;0" align="center"&gt; -10 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td sdval="38910" sdnum="2058;0;DD/MM/AA" align="center" height="17"&gt; 12/07/06 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8382" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8382 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8478" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8478 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8347" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8347 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="35.0000000000006" sdnum="2058;0;0" align="center"&gt; 35 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td sdval="38911" sdnum="2058;0;DD/MM/AA" align="center" height="17"&gt; 13/07/06 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8421" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8421 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8346" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8346 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8437" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8437 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="16.0000000000005" sdnum="2058;0;0" align="center"&gt; 16 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td sdval="38924" sdnum="2058;0;DD/MM/AA" align="center" height="17"&gt; 26/07/06 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8463" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8463 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8388" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8388 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="1.8766" sdnum="2058;0;0.0000" align="center"&gt; 1.8766 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td sdval="303" sdnum="2058;0;0" align="center"&gt; 303 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; NipthePips : No, i don't test it on others currency except GBP/USD and GBP/JPY. Any backtesting or forward would be gladly appreciated. Thanks jlowder : Personaly, i don't take a trade when the cross happens before the dot or when the cross happens after the nonlag. So, i wait for a dot then for the cross and then for the nonlag. It doesn't matter if the cross and the nonlag happen at the same time but like i said earlier, the cross should never happen after the nonlag. I hope this answers yours questions.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi, Great idea. I don't know enough the metaquote language so if someone can create it, thanks in advance. I choose the 4 Hour timeframe to have time to see the dot but it's true that if we can have an alarm signal, it will be very helpfull.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Judex001 I have a question, is there a time frame you go by, or do you place the trade whenever you see the dot (if everthing goes as set in the rule). I assume during news reports your not making trades.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hey judexx001 I know one thing that would help your indicator a lot is change the color of the dots. What I mean is, every chart Ive every seen is always blue means good red means bad. My candles are blue meaning the price is going up and red meaning the price is going down. Its just kind of awkward to see a red dote show up on your screen and you say buy it or a blue dot and sell it. Its nothing major just a little commit. just my 2 cents. Looks great. thanks for the hard work. chrinist

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Just a quick note the non-lag MA does turn yellow/non yellow while the current candle/bar is still forming ... so i wouldn't enter a trade until the end of the current candle confirms that the yellow section doesn't switch back to a non signal. eg .. on the current 4 hour candle the non-lag ma may show a yellow line indicating a go on a trade but during the formation of the candle it may switch from yellow (go signal) to a non-yellow (no trade) line. so remember wait till the candle is fully formed until entering a potential trade!!!! heheheh

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Right now, i'm on vacation so i place the trades whenever i see a dot but during the year, i usualy trade between 6 am and 10 am (Montreal time). Because this method is based on cable, a lot of good signal occured during the european market (1:00 Am to 7:00 AM Montreal time) so if you can trade during that time frame : lucky you ! I have an other method to trade the news and don't use this one because most of time, the prices moves too fast and there're a lot of wrong signals.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
It's depend if you are agressive or conservative ! If you are agressive, you can go when the non lag show for the first time a yellow line but if you are more conservative, like matrung said, wait for the candle to be fully formed. To be more conservative means less profit but also more safety. Thanks for the note matrung - I'm going to add the precision in the pdf.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
To chrinist : I use green bars so I am not accustomed to the red and blue thing but you are right - it s more logical and more easy to read and it's very easy to change that in the color properties. Thanks

--- 帖子 #23 ---
No problem, this little system doesn't look too bad i like the 4 hours time frame it allows for price to "smooth" itself out more and avoids the whipsaw's of the lesser timeframes ..

--- 帖子 #24 ---
You can customize the colors by right click on the chart and choose indicators list, then click on SHI_SilverTrendSig then click on edit,click on the colors tab , double click on the color you want to change and choose the color from the drop down list.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
ok .. here's a little further contribution from me. although this line of thinking is based purely on "eyeballing" back data ... it seems to me that to avoid whipsaws (based on the 4 hour timeframe), it looks like the order of the signals should be the following .. 1. SHI_silver trend should bring up a signal DOT 2. then the ERGODIC or non-lag MA should signal in the same direction as the DOT. doesn't look like it matters whether ERGODIC or non-lag MA shows up first. note: it seems if the ERGODIC shows a signal then a dot appears say 1-2 candle bars after then it's a good chance that's it's a whipsaw indication and you should just avoid. e.g ERGODIC starts indicating a buy signal at candle bar 1 ... then at candle bar 2-3 a SHI_silver trend buy DOT displays then the non-lag MA shows a yellow ... it seems to me that this will whipsaw and be a loosing trade ... MORE TESTING needed though .. however I am beginning to like this system more and more ...

This method appears somewhat better at least on 4 H charts than BRAINTREND and the use of Trend Manager and Triggerlines, it appears the turning points appear one bar earlier on almost all entries, compared especially to Braintrend, which is a decent method, also the whipsaws with braintrend, which can occur from time to time are much less noticable with the tlatomi method, basically what we need is an Audio alert at the turning points.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Veryinteresting and simple method...thanks!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Judex, This seems like it will be a great method. Thank you for sharing it with us. I just wanted to point out something I noticed... I may be wrong, but I think we will all get different signals depending on the platform that we use (i.e. time zone differences? or data feed differences?). For instance, the first chart that you posted shows a picture perfect setup on GBP, i.e. dot appears first, then the cross, then the non-lag. However, in the charts that jlowder and carioca posted, as well as the one I'm seeing on my platform now, the non-lag appeared first, then the cross, then the blue dot, which would have meant that no trade would have been taken. After an initial scan through the past couple of days, the system still would have done well, regardless of platform. Anyway, I just thought I'd point out what I noticed so none of us will be confused with seemingly conflicting/different signals. Thanks again! Nat

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I just realized I was posting the same time frame that he was. I just figured I was posting a later image... It would appear as if we are getting different results, but I'm using the exact same settings as posted in the PDF. Wonder what is different. Jason

--- 帖子 #31 ---
the shi_silvertrendsig indicator that paints the dots is repainting the past, dots are repainted, I had a dot @ 00:00 (using alpari) on GBPUSD and it magically was removed from 00:00 and painted on 04:00, if u just look at dots u will c they accurately pinpoint the tops and the bottoms, the reason they do is that the indicator repaints the dots, I looked at the code and it confirms this

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I'm not getting the three colors on the non lag.....I went in and changed the color property from 0 to 1 and that gave me the red and blue but where is the yellow indicator? .... would you post the properties window so I can see the settings? thanks

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I notice that in the first posts - i don't know why. I use metatrader from FXDD in demo because my broker is FxSol and Fx accuchart don't have 4 hours charts for now (maybe one day i hope).

--- 帖子 #35 ---
So if a price bar has closed and a dot is above (or below) it, the dot can move to another bar later? Or are you saying that a dot may appear and dissapear before a bar has closed?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
the dot can move to another bar later, the indicator code reevaluates existing dots and move them if necessary depending on the price changes, so it repaints itself

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Long GBP/USD @ 1.9098 - Stop @ 1.9053 - Exit @ 1.9128 Profit : 30 Pips I move the stop to breakeven a few minutes after the entry and i exit the trade at 1.9128 because i just want to take advantage of the us news. http://www.tlatomi.com/blog/images/ex2.gif

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks for this Jude.I'm in the UK and use the free Metatrader demo on CABLE. The spots are,quite frankly staggering on the 4hour charts.As far as I'm concerned this is the nearest thing to a Holy Grail indicator that I have ever seen in five years of trading.AWESOME!!! I could have made about 800pips since 26 July using it - see attached chart.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi, Thanks for the comment but be carreful with the backtesting because the shisilvertrend indicator repaints itself so the results in backtest are not always the real ones. If you want to see the shi_silvertrend without repainting itself - modify the code : for SH = 1 ; SH &lt; NB ; SH++&lt;nb;sh++&gt; replace by for SH=1;SH&lt;nb;sh++ sh="1;SH&lt;nb;sh++" by="" for="" (sh="1;SH&lt;nb;sh++)"&gt;=0;SH-- For now, i made all my tests in real time and use the signal dot only when the others 2 indicators are in the same way. I m actually looking for an another indicator to replace the Shi_silverTrend.&lt;/nb;sh++&gt;&lt;/nb;sh++&gt;

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi All, Very good method, &amp; it helps the current system that im actually using. This method enhances my TIGA ABDUL system. I uses 9SMA as an entry signal when it crosses 5EMA. This is also exactly where the yellow line crosses!! The rest of the indicators help to sharpen my system especially to reduced fake-outs! Thanks so very much as it help my current system sharper &amp; more profitable than it already is. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
After seeing great works in progress at the FF (VEGAS, SIDUS-BAGOVINO, KNIFE) this is another great - no - FANTASTIC TOOL! Thanks Judex!!!!! I think you will benefit from sharing. Just look over at the SIDUS method thread.....the refining process that is going over there, contributions from OrangeRoshan, Bagovino and others are absolutely genius. Watch out, this thread has the potential to grow pretty fast. Hold your breath and continue. I have to build "faith" in this system, yet. I see on my platform (European Time GMT+2) the following setup on GBP/USD, but I have not the courage to take as it seems to be on the HIGH END of things: - All the Tlatomi conditions seem to be met (red dot, CCI, and yellow nonlag) - so I should go LONG on GBP/USD right now. BUT! Here my concerns: 1. Price level (Price action) shows high level 2. According to Vegas 4 Hr we are at an outer fib level (he mentions that once it reaches outer fib levels AND shows signs of exhaustion it is time to look for a SHORT) I'm confused. Would YOU go LONG on GBP/USD right now? Thanks for any contribution. Peter.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Perhaps a repost of the original indicators replacing the silvertrend with the non repainting version in the first posting may help hehe

--- 帖子 #43 ---
OrangeRoshan: Thanks for your valuable contributions over at the SIDUS thread. Pure genius at work . I have read the TIGA ABDUL document, but your last comment here caught my attention. Do you use the 9SMA as your new entry point? Did you drop the original SIDUS-BAGOVINO MA? Thanks for clarifying this. Peter.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
OK .... that took care of the missing colors, thank you for your help....This looks like it is going to be an excelant indicator, good work

--- 帖子 #45 ---
petercross : If you see post 38, i think it's exactly the trade you are wondering to take except that i take it earlier than you - In this case, i take it because the us new was'nt dangerous and i wanted to profit from the first movement (interest rate unchanged) but in the case of big news like NFP etc.... i stay out of the market. To answer your question - rignt now, i will stay out of the market : -price has never be so high since 04/2005 -a possible pin bar in formation -possible false signal When using this method - always look at the price for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
When i applied the changes to the silvertrend indicator and then reapplied that to mt4 it froze it ... everytime i tried it .. don't know what's wrong so i'll stick to the original for now and only take signals as they happen ..

--- 帖子 #47 ---
SO, you are NOT trading at all???? Since your method is being applied to GBP/USD and GBP/JPY only - this would leave you with no other options??? Please clarify.... Wish you Pips. Peter.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Personaly, i'm still using the repaint version of the indicator because i don't care if it repaint or no while the others two indicators give me the same signal. In general, it repaint itself on the next bar when the movement is not yet confirmed. I upload the norepaint indicator if you want to try with this version.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
no others options ?? I don't understand what you mean. What options ? I don't take this trade if this is your question. PS : i'm sorry - i'm sure you already guess that english is not my first language.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
If the dots are appearing exactly where they were originally placed, this new version isn't very useful. They seem to be nowhere near a buy or sell signal. I think perhaps just the nolag with the FX sniper might sufficient for buy/sell signals. Jason

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Yes, I currently only use 5EMA &amp; 9SMA and it looks like Tlatomi method is using it too. I also now trade on the 4hr, Tlatomi also. Vegas use 8SMA as his filter and it is very powerful to catch tops &amp; bottoms. Now with Tlatomi, his confirming indicators makes TIGA ABDUL easy to use. Looking forward to see the EA. Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Don't worry my friend: English is not my first language! It is actually fantastic how this common topic (Forex) AND the Internet draws people together of different backgrounds, etnias, religions and languages! If only for that it was worth being here on the FF! Ok. My question was: Have you been trading the GBP/USD UP to this point that seems to be critical/complicated? If I understand you correctly, you are not taking this LAST trade, because of obvious reasons, but you came all the way up to this point with GBP? Right? With "no other options" I meant: If your system doesn't give you signals on GBP/USD or GBP/JPY than you just sit and wait? You wouldn't trade other currencies with this system? Wish you the best. Peter. PS: By the way, I guessed that by the name of your system that you are hispanic background. But, again: WHO cares??? In Forex-Land we are all the same.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
1. How does Tlatomi use 9SMA? Did I miss something???? 2. Is somebody working on an EA for YOUR refined system? Man, that would be awesome, but also very complicated to do, as you have many "rules" added to the original SIDUS system. Could you please mention your new TIGA ABDUL settings? I mention this in this thread since it seems that you are mixing two powerfull ways of trading here (TIGA ABDUL+TLATOMI - Man, I love the combination of two systems that have mysterious names from ORIENT+LATINAMERICA - great synergie here! ) Always appreciative. Peter.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
That's right ! I didn't try this system on others currency yet. By try, i mean in real time because backtesting with this method is not very reliable. I'm half mexican

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi, This indicator seems very promising so far, and i'm sure that it will develop by the time, and will have more filters that eliminatea false calls. thank you Judas, and keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi judexx, First I want to thank you for sharing with us. Now I have a question, I'm afraid it's a silly question, but please bear with me. My question is on the picture attached. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Just installed these indicators on the Tlatomi: 5EMA 9SMA The crosses of this two indicates a signal. However, it must be confirmed by the 3 Tlatomi indicators. I donot used the RSI21. The usual trend &amp; resistence lines can also be used to predict price movements. Vegas Fibs &amp; tunnels as usual also play a big part in helping with entry &amp; exit &amp; PA. However im now studying the behaviour of the NonLag MA With the 2 Tiga Abdul MA. Most of the times, distances &amp; positions of the MA can be used as a verification in terms of entry, exit &amp; momentum. Thanks. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi, This system is as good as any of the indicator based system but I do have a issue with the silver trend. IMO it probably is one of the worst indicators as I cant see any real value for any indicator which re-corrects itself. Hence the indicator is not reliable. But that being said, there is more chance of a false signal on a lower time frame than a higher time frame. If you do find something else to replace the Silver trend,, I think it would make the system even better. Cheers

--- 帖子 #59 ---
here. I just installed them and use 5EMA and 9SMA in conjunction. THANK YOU ALL!!!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I reversed the red and blue ... seems more correct for me. shi_silver_trend_sig, seems to be right most of the time. Thanks all!!!

Hello, I have looked through a number of threads and I am unable to find info on how to convert Metatrader file extentions (mq4) into CSV or Text formats. I am using a different charting software which I would like to check out your system.. Can anyone advise on how to convert these extentions outside of metatrader? Kirl

--- 帖子 #62 ---
You may try to open the indicator with metaeditor, and copy the code. i'm not sure if this is what you asked for, but hope it helps

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi, The three indicators work independently so even if the trend is down on the others indicators, we can have a contrary signal on the Shi_SilverTrend. Now if you see your chart later, the dot works fine because the price went up a little bit. However, don't take this kind of trade because price is still at high level.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
On the SHI_silver_trendSig, looks like the IHR is more reliable. Is that what most of you are using? 30Min chart has a lot of errors. I noticed (the dots) appear and then dissapear just as quick sometimes. So how reliable they are, still studying them?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I like the repainting version of the dots. It acted on the price movements. Just like trading with the MA, the trend (crosses) will keep changing as the price changes (bunjee jumping on the OHLC) until the next bar is formed. Similarly with the dot, we dont just trade when there is a dot, apart from looking at the other indicators, when the dot is already painted, we must wait for the next bar to be formed. This way, the trend is confirmed and entry/exit can begin. Repainting can reduce fake-outs. Which help us keep pips. Thanks and Happy learning/trading everyone.

Is this only work on Interbankfx version 4? not 3 where i have an account setup? Thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
For some reason the ... NonLagMA_v4.mq4 .... indicator only gives me an addition of a yellow line. I do not have the tomato or SkyBlue lines. I changed nothing in the code and saved it under experts then Indicators. Know what could be wrong??? I saved the indicators on post # 1 , would those be the latest indicators to use OrangeRosen??? Is this mostly the indicators you now use? It gives me nothing really, when I have the 5EMA and the 9SMA to verify the trend. Thanks very much! Just learning here!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi, In NonLagMa properties, the parameters are : Price : 0 Length : 9 Displace : 0 Filter : 20 Color : 1 ColorBarBack : 0 Deviation 0.0 These should fix your problem.

Heres a suggestion: Open a MT4 demo account and using it for charting the indicators only. Then use what ever platform you are currently using to trade. This is what im doing. Multiple monitors helps greatly, but a single monitor will do. With all the things you can leraned in this thead, buying another monitor will be just around the corner. Happy Trading!

Thanks, Sometimes the obvious is right in front of you and you (I) did not see it. Kirl

--- 帖子 #74 ---
There are many traders that use MT4 or VT Trader for thier studies and trade with another broker, I do also.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
That worked wonders! Thank you so much!!! Really appreciated!!!

Can I ask do you mostly still use 5EMA and 9SMA cross and the tlatomi Indicators or are there others yet that might help me trade the Forex pairs? Just learning and paper trading at this time, but would like to be able to learn you're method better. I am also giving Firebird a whirl ... but so far today ... it did not help me to be profitable. In fact I think I'm at a net loss today with it. I know you are doing very well! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
At the moment to keep things simple: The cross of the 5/9 signals entry, but the dreaded whipsaw sometimes changes that, even on the 4hr. Simply because, MAs are lagging indicators. Therefore, on the 4hr, wait for the dot to appear (in my case I change it to red for sell &amp; viceversa), wait for the next bar to formed. Then: 1) Look for a trend change (the 5/9) to confirm this. The angle of the 9SMA will tell you this) 2) Look for the crossing of 5/9 (might lose some good pips, but its safer) 3) Switch around 1hr, 30mins charts to see when the dot is already there. Dont want to see it do any David Cooperfield stuff! 4) Enter trade Ive notice the dots can teleport itself to other bars, which is cool when you are watching star trek, but not when you are trading 20m lots! It does this because the trend has changed. Eg: Red dot appear, so you wait for the next bar to appear and whammo, you make an entry to sell. Then after a couple of hours, you noticed your are -40pips! What Happened? You manually backtest, and couldnt find a similar scenarion, where: Usually when a dot appear, the price starts to move into your direction but this time, and its still going the opposite direction even after 5 bars!! This is where the 5/9 helps. Do not enter any position until the 5/9 confirms it!! But when it does, make pips is all you will be doing. A suggestion of exit would be: 1) 1 bar after the opposite dot appear (look at the slope/angle of the 5/9 to confirm trend change); or 2) the 5/9 crosses I hope that will help a bit. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Excellent addition to this little strategy ... helps to better confirm a better entry especially with that "moving" dot signal ... hehe

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Dont forget to double check trend with FX Sniper as well.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I put the Filter to 0 just to smoothen the lines. Thanks

Hello. Looks like an interesting method. I am unable to create your system. I am using "GFT" trading platform. Can you give me a step by step method to use your indicators on my retail account? Can open the zip file but windows does not recognize the extensions. Thanks

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Regarding charting issues, look at my post #73. Try using Total commander, it opens all extensions. GFT is one my broker too. When anyone wants to open a demo with it, let me know, ill send you my IB link where I can create any amount you want plus it doent expire. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Ok. I have opened a demo account with MetaTrader. I have cut and pasted the three unzipped files into the MetaTrader4/templates. How do I access your trading system once in the platform? In other words inserting the indicators/system? Thanks alot !!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Well, i'm in a test right now. Just wondering how to read the sniper indicator? After dot appear 5/9 will be my next indicator, so how about sniper? Instead of 4 hrs chart can we apply to other TF too? 15 mins 30 mins.? I've tried to use it for E/U TF 30mins and it works.. --&gt; can I do this? Please advise my frend...

Nothing can be said better than that.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Ok thanks for your clarification. One thing, If the dot appear for sell for e.g G/U 1.9074, the price start to active dtrend is it? and would it be posible the price movement more that 1.9074? above the dots? Where to put our stop loss?? Normally i will stop target at 20-30 pips.

Something is wrong with SHI indicator...

--- 帖子 #99 ---
What's wrong ? OrangeRoshan, thanks for answering the questions

--- 帖子 #100 ---
"Exit when a new dot appears" is the rule. When?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I'll appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
The template is available on post #1. Just add the 5EMA (BLUE) &amp; 9SMA (ORANGE, of course), price CLOSE. Hope this will help you.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
This images are clearer. Happy Learning.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I'm looking to replace the Shi_Silver trend by another indicator. I think that the Shi_Channel Indicator could be a good option. It's also repaint itself but less frequently than the dot version. I don't believe in backtesting so i will test that possibility starting now on GBP/USD and GBP/JPY. What do you think ? another idea ? By the way, I love the addition of the two MA. 1 - Price touch the channel 2 - Ergodic cross 3 - NonLagMa yellow 4 - Ma cross 5 - Ma cross (exit) http://www.tlatomi.com/blog/images/graph.gif

--- 帖子 #105 ---
SHI channel indicator was originally written expressly for the 15 minute time frame. So was the juice indicator. Don't know if they would be at all suitable for the H4 timeframe but maybe worth testing.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I didn't know that - thanks for the info !

--- 帖子 #107 ---
For more legibility, i replace the two ma (9SMA and 5EMA) by this indicator MA_Crossover_Signal

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Now this indicator is great! I really do thank you for posting it here. I think it is more accurate with 5 and 9 and I still have 12 just when I feel the need the the second MA indicator.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I DO NOT EVEN USE IT anymore as it makes the Chart so cluttered and harder to read. I would use it if it opened in a second window though ... and I do not do code so unless someone knows how, I will just not use it for now.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I may have missed it, but has anyone programmed an audio alert for this great set of indicators? It would sure make a 4 hr chart easier to manage....

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yes, when we can find a more stable indicator, that will be great. Anyway, great system. It has added at least 50% more profits to my current system. Thanks

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Can we have alert as well please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Yes, I split my chart into 4 windows. The 1hr, 4hrs (without the nonlag MA (5/9)), 4hrs (without 5/9, with nonlag MA), &amp; Daily to show me the range. Refreshing the periodicity on all windows when a new bar emerges. This way, I can be updated when the dots do their teleporting capability. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
OrangeRoshan, I really enjoy your posts on the FF. I have been looking foward to the new version of your Tiga Abdul. Do you make at least 300 pips a day now? I am in awe... You don't use 30-minute chart anymore? Happy pipping! Spa

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Folks ! I have a question regarding the appearance of the dots. Is it possible to change the indicator in a way the dots repaint themselves every time a new bar has been created ? Once again thank you for this awesome threat... Greetings from Essen in germany Bernhard

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Im averaging minimum 500+ pips now a day per broker with just 6 monkeys (pairs). I used to trade 12, but doing it on 4 brokers is a nightmare. Yes, I still do use 30mins chart mainly for the 100/30 system. My trading is now fully automated on 2 platforms. We are still trying to solve some API issues with the other 2 brokers for the EA to run properly. The tlatomi system have shed some lights into the Tiga Abdul system. The next gerenation of Tiga Abdul is still on backtesting. My Japanese team are working on it. Anyway, here are some of the backtesting results on Tiga Abdul ver. 2.3s on GBPUSD. The results are lower than the actual forwardtesting +-15%. Hope this will help a bit. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thank you so much OrangeRoshan. I'm excited to hear that your Tiga Abdul can now make more than 500 pips a day! You are more like an extra large pipster now! I'm truly impressed with you. I can hear the sound of pipping when you walk! By the way, you have a team of Japanese working for you? You said in your original Tiga Abdul document that you are a newbie but you are actually a professional trader, aren't you? Please let us know when your next version of Tiga Abdul is ready. I want to be the first one to read it, or try the EA if you will. Thanks and have a even greater pipping day! Spa

When I download the Indicators.zip file and try to apply to my charts, I get a syntax error. Can someone help please?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
The Japs are not working for me, they are my live trading team specialising in Asian Market trading times. As being a professional trader, like i mentioned before, im new to the Live trading over the internet. My 14yrs previous trading method was bank to bank &amp; hard cash using fundamental analysis. Therefore, im still a newbie to this. But remember spartan, trading is all about psychology. In the order of importance: 1. Discipline 2. Rules 3. Motivation My trading results are nothing compared to the other trading team members. What is important is not the number of pips that you can make, but the type of pips you made. My average 500+ pips are not entirely quality pips, but it does make my investors very happy. Anyway, keep learning and always believe in yourself that you can do it too. Thank you &amp; happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Without asking details, I will list things to do in order to make them work. Download the file and save it whereever is convenient for you. Unzip the file. Make sure you have MetaTrader4 installed on your computer. Copy(or cut) those unzipped files and paste them to program files/metatrader/experts/indicators. Restart MetaTrader You can find the indicators you just pasted in Insert(menu)/Indicators/Custom. Choose one indicator at a time from the three and change the setting as described earlier in this thread. Repeat the process #7 two more times and you're done! I hope this helps. Spa

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I have learned the hard way, really fast, that discipline and rules are very, very important in trading. Trading successfully definitely takes a lot more than just clicking and pray for pips with a +, as you say. Motivation...is what I need but come to think of this, I am already motivated but I am trying to hold off from being too trigger happy because I have not yet come up with the system with which I can be 100% confident. Some traders learn to be conservative and trade only when it looks absolutely safe to trade but I feel that is not the answer to my search for the perfect trading system. I see charts all day and pips are literally everywhere yet all I can get is 100 pips a month? That's not so bad if it's guaranteed 100 pips but I know nothing is 100% guaranteed so I would not take that route. I think your system is one of the best when it comes to catching all the birds you can see when lions are not around. The pips are out there! By the way, how do you distinguish quality pips from not so quality pips? I think many of us pervert traders out there would prefer as ugly pips as possible! Again, we appreciate your assisting and motivating others and look forward to your next version of Tiga Abdul. Spa

Hi OrangeRosHan,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I've followed this and the sidus thread from the beginning and I'm trying to get my head around your 100/30 system. I'm studying you tiga Abdlul and all your posts in both threads, also chasing up Rob Booker.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Can you recommend any other reading? &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Any help much appreciated&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; From &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Yellow, who is very Green&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #124 ---
What you mean is quality pips. Pips that can be made almost guaranteed. Most professional traders take this route. They know they are capable to get certain number of pips every month. It can be between 100 or more pips only. It is almost pressureless and emotionaless trading. They play big lots, when translated to its monetary value, its worth more than anyone who made 500pips a day. To achieve this, PA or Price analysis is very crucial. They know the behaviour of certain pairs like watching the same movie 100 times. Im not very good at PA, because I have other team members who did this for me. They incorporated it insde the EA as much as they possibly can. But, im also learning the basics. In due time, I will master it. Stay motivated!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
There are many good mentors out there who wrote good books. People like Rob Booker certainly a very reputable mentor along with many others. Read every publication by Abraham Cofnan.

Does the Price Analysis you talk about something related to right brain...I mean is it more like intuitive skills to read price movement rather than technical or logical analysis? I remember one book I read about speed reading years ago. As most people here know, subconcious mind can do a lot more than what conscious mind can do. By training to connect your conscious mind to your subconscious mind you'd able to accomplish what you could not possibly do with your conscious mind alone. As a beginning trader, I would have to stay away from trading intuitively yet it is intriquing that over the horizon there is a definite place in this trading voyage where intuitive decision making takes you to the next level. Maybe I should start training my subconscious mind to collect pips from today. Thanks so much again! Spa

Is there instructions for how to use this on the metatrader 4? I have downloaded it and set the scripts in place but when i run them i don't get any results.. also have set the parameters as stated? Can someone advise ? Appreciate it.. Rich

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks for the reply's ... I will study these. I can see if you had a mil. in the acct. you could go 10 or more lots and make a fortune, if you know when to trade! I have looked at Firebird ... and right now I think the moving averages and the indicators you use are superior. Do you recommend any Company for picks long and short? Is there a subscription service that gets it right 90% of the time when to trade long or short. I think it would be worth it when you are trading real dollars. I would be willing to subscribe to a recommendations ser. if it helped. Guess studying you're system and understanding it is probally as good as it gets. ha. Thanks a lot!!!

--- 帖子 #135 ---

Uao OrangeRoshan that's impressive! Is it possible to have some documentations about your Tiga Abdul system trading? thanks

--- 帖子 #137 ---
would you be willing to share you're EA WITH US so we can PIP sooner and better??? I would even pay you for it. You are the GUY we all admire!!! Help us PLEASE! I want to have an EA eventually that will make me big money too! LOL .... THANKS for all you have done for us Newbies here. I am still trying to get this down. THANKS TO ALL YOU PIPSTERS SHARING HERE WHAT YOU KNOW!!!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Yeah, right. I often wonder how I got home alive when I don't remember anything! But seriously, I'm no psychologist though it's well known that subconscious mind picks up a lot more than conscious mind does. If you ever wondered like me how you got yourself into a trade where right after you took a position, the market starts to move against you and very fast too; the answer to that common occurence may be that your subconscious knew where the market was going but your lack of self-esteem led you to the losing trade situation. After a couple of trades like that in a row, I wondered if this world happened to revolve around me but I guess it would be more understandable if my subconscious mind knew where the market was going. What do you guys think about it? Maybe that's why psychology plays a big role in trading. Spa

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I think about it all the time and wonder if I should do the opposite of what I want to do. I mean to short when I want to go long and so on.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
A great way to figure out what happens there is to keep a journal of your trades. Quite often you'll look back and see something you wrote that broke your rules. Like forgetting to look at the larger time frame and realising that you tried to trade against the trend, or had tried to pick a top/bottom in the market. Through fear of missing out on getting in early you Sell on a break of the up trend only to have the market bounce back up as part of a cosolidation period. At the least the journal will help identify situations that your method doesn't work, or problems with your mentallity.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
My subconscious does all my typing ... well a lot of it. Now perfecting trading is where I need the juice! LOL

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Good point! Especially about picking top/bottom... hm.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thanks. I did a rush job doing the early version of Tiga Abdul method. After reading this, go thru this thread and incorporate the tlatomi method. You cant go wrong. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I must apologise the EA doesnt belong to me alone. When we decided to make it available, i will post it here at FF. For the meantime, study the methods here and you will join the Pipster club sooner than you think! Thanks

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Trust the method 100%. Remember what nike says, "JUST DO IT". There will be losing trades, but there will be more winning trades. When you keep to the normal 2% Risk Management model, it should be profitable. When entering a trade, you must be emotionless. The method says, enter Long; with proper Sl &amp; TP; ENTER and log it into your journal. Dont even look at the chart to see where it is going. When it makes, it makes, when it doesnt, it doesnt. I will spend my time studying other currencies looking for the next signal. Dont cloud your thinking with things like, "Is it going the right way?", or "Oh my god, why is it -10 pips?" or "I should have done the reverse, damn!" The method works. The winning trades outnumbered the losing trades. But, indecisive attiude &amp; fear will make a winning strategy a losing one. Look at the backtesting results i posted. It has a sizeable losing trades also, but its still positive due to more winnings. Thats why I posted it. Its the only rule (out of 3) that I can give, MOTIVATION. To master the other 2, you must learn to tame the beast inside you. Stick to the 2% RM and trade with confidence. I hope that helps a bit. "The enemy has been discovered! The only enemy you have is YOU!"

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Here are the indicators i use. To Judex001: Thank you my friend. tlatomi is a great system! Welldone!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Orange, thanks for the pdf summary. I think the method is excellent and in forward testing it works very well. However, I cant agree with your exit strategy. Exiting 50% of your size after 10 pips when trading off the hourly is seriously cutting your profits short. Instead, you should be riding the trend until the market tells you to get off (new dot appearing in the case of this method). Personally, I exit according to the pair that I am trading. As a general guide, for Cable, USD/JPY, USD/CHF and GBP/JPY, I would have 30 SL and 60 TP1 (Scale out 50% of size; move stop to b/e and let remaining 50% run to secondary signal of trend change). For the other pairs, I would have SL 20 and TP1 40. As satisfiying as it may seem to bag 10 pips, you are limiting yourself in the long run, particularly if you are trading off the hourly. Just my 0.02

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks Zuke for the comments. I understand what you mean by limiting yourself in the long run and I very much agree with you. However, the PDF is focus mainly for newbies. Riding on a winning trade is usually not a good idea. It can turn into nightmares very quickly, when you know what I mean. You sounded like an experienced trader, and that is fantastic. Your comment and suggestion should be taken and followed. It is also what I might do in many instances. But, i always give a simple solution to newbies, so that they can develop the skill required to ride on a winning trade, in due time. Another thing about the 10pip exit is actually an excellent strategy. In the world of Professional trading; its not how many pips you can make, but how many pips you can keep. Its how you trade not how many pips you can make. But, a pro with a discipline trading and making tons of pips are also good! Heheee... My point is this: EURUSD 10pips x 1lot (100,000)= $100 10pips x 10lots = $1,000 10pips x 100lots = $10,000 10pips x 1,000lots = $100,000 Rob Booker a renowned trader &amp; mentor also recomends it. Check out www.robbooker.com Notice I didnt mentioned about the pairs I traded or even the stoploss &amp; takeprofits in the PDF? Exit strategy is purely depends on the size of ones account and trading lots. I keep it an open book for anyone to suggest and learn. Your post will help others to iddentify their preferences. But, for newbie, I still suggest 10pips. You know what, positive pis are much better than negative pips! And theres always other signal that you can trade on. Thanks for the wonderful suggestions, I really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
This method seems to easy! 10 pips is almost guarenteed. You say your doing 500 pips a day with this? Thank you for sharing with us, I look forward to testing it next week.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
You are very welcome !!! I love the combination of the two systems. This way, one avoids many fase signals. OrangeRoshan : Do you mind if i put your pdf "Tiga Abdul with Tlatomi method" in the first post of the thread ? That way, everyone can see quickly the evolution.

Perfect. Thats fine. Thanks Judex!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Exactly! The 500pips are derived from different versionS of Tiga Abdul staring at the PC 14hrs a day. Not recommended. I did it because, I want to win our Team competetion. On normal trading, 100pips/day is enough! I would recommend to get just 10pips per trade or even per day. Your account is safer and so is your heart &amp; blood pressure. As your trading disipline becomes second nature and experience grows thru knowing 1 or 2 monkeys (pairs) inside out. You can virtually do anything you want with this method. May I suggest you to study PA (Price Analysis). Its a deadly tool when use with these methods (3A &amp; Tlatomi). Make Pips not War!

Keep it up Judex! Orange, 500pips/day now ha? I dont know what to say but i know what to do.... When can i signup for you tution class? I saw your new PDF with the combination with the tlatomi, that is like the combination of Roti Canai with Kuah Kari. Good work guys.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I don't get exactly what is confusing you but it may be because often crosses are not officially there until the next bars have formed already. If this does not help you, you may want to post your chart and your settings so that someone can help you out.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi Orange, thanks for your constructive comments. I now fully understand what you means regarding the 10 pips and would recommend it (particularly to newbies). In my forward testing thus far, at least 15 pips have been guaranteed on EVERY trade! Thanks for sharing an EXCELLENT method with us all. Very much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
you're system looks to be the best I have seen. Safe entry and exits. I follow you ... there is no need to be early for entry ... as you have said so well ... let the trade come to you. Same on a short. I finally get it, and that is ... to be patient if you want your cash to stay in you're acct., and add to it. Thanks!

Hi OrangeRoshan ! First of all thank you very much for participating in this thread Regarding the Tlatomi_Abdul method I have two questions : 1. Can you recommend this method for smaller and larger time frames as the mentioned 4 h period ? 2. When you're in the trade how long would you personally stay in it ? ( I guess it's alittle more than 10 pips ) I think that psychology plays a big roll in this case...... We could bank in the 10-15 pips by moving our stop and let the profits run.... But not every trade is running like hell.... Often the trend changes ... 3. As an additional hint it's helpfull to put the Guppy moving averages on the charts..... ( see attached USD/CHF 4h chart ) 4. The picture comes much clearer then Greetings from germany Bernhard

Yes, we are also using it on Tiga Abdul other version. Tell me what you have found out, hopefully we learn together. Thanks

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I traded on the 4hr, but use 30mins or 1hr as to confirm the short &amp; medium term trend. Stick to 4hr, its safer!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
OrangeRoshan, With your skill, are you able to trade from 5k to 1million in a year ? But if based on yr saying of doubling every week, u need less than 3mths. I am just curious.. and thinking of possibility, not trying to be funny.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
In all seriousness, it can be done and it has been done, over and over and over again even in a more shorter time. But, my clients drawdown profits every week. Compounding effect is at the minimal. EBS and eSpeedFX enable us to wire accounts in minutes. They are all sorts of things going on in this world, that even after we see it, we still cant believe it. TRUE!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Another thing, we have a live team trading competetion. So, it was different. Now, the competetion is over, and I am not the winner!! Not suprising! Im back to normal trade mood. There are a many other methods out there which is almost close to holy grail that traders are not sharing, believe me! There are 2 things that will influence your life: 1. The books you read 2. The people you associating with Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Thats good advise OrangeRoshan, since I came to this forum, I have learned alot. Im glad the people on this forum are here to help us newbies. This topic as grown and I would like to thank Judex001 for sharing this wonderful method and OrangeR and the others for adding to it.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
t thanks for sharing the method, i hope to master your trading method and understand the market psychology before im 20 year old... back to the topic, i believe that your trading method is only compatible with 2 pair of currency; G/U and G/J... so what other method do you used to trade other than that 2 pair of currency..????

--- 帖子 #192 ---
OrangeRoshan, I am surprised that you are not the winner. 500pips per day and you still doesn't win. You have a number of super traders around you.. kudo to them. Mind sharing what strategies they use ? Anyway, i like your generousity

--- 帖子 #193 ---
It works on all currencies and it works best on volatile markets. Lets stick to this to simplified things at the moment.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Well, they dont goto English Forum at the moment. In brief, they are Vegas Fans, thats all that I can say.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Thanks ... I will look at these then ....IBFX &amp; SpaceVision. Even though I want an EA for sure eventually .... I would still make the decisions for a while. Once I am winning with you're system ... I will let 'er rip beginning with smaller .10 lots. I gotta learn to preserve my Capital! Also on indicators: I have not had too much time to look at Heiken Ashi ... yet .... but I will and think it will add to the other leading indicators like NonaLagMa, Shi. Not a trailing indicator like the 5EMA 9SMA ... which I also like a lot for safe and good pips. I agree let's keep this Method simple! I will watch live and you can as well ... and you will see ...... maybe even enhance an already Superb System. Hey thanks Orange, I really love to follow you're posts and watch as things progress! Thank You!!!

Could someone reprogramm FX Sniper's Ergodic CCI&amp;Trigger so it will let to change the colors and thickness of the lines? When instolled, the blue line is normal size, but it changes in a few minutes for thick one. Also the colors keep coming back to original settings. It's too bright for my eyes. I try to keep my charts in culm colors. Thanks, Julia

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Try this one. It should work. When you drag the indicator over the charts, you can edit and change the colors and the widths.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
amazing system. i just can beleive it. great work to all

orangeroshan,... can i ask you some question...what do you mean by; a) 100/30 &lt;----i dont understand this term on your PDF b) black hole &amp; the maximiser

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I think he meant the method works on all currency pairs. But as to other methods and techniques he uses, he would not want to disclose at this point so that we can focus on learning and mastering the basics of his method. He explained those terms in the Sidus thread before.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
spa..thanks for the reply... hmmm....its goin to be very tough reading on sidus thread....bcoz so many trader participate on the discussion.... thanks...

Me and my dad started a live account at $300, and now we have over 13,000 pips in less than a year.

The importance of entering a trade using the primary signal. A good example of what just happened with CableDollar. The Blue dot appears &amp; the CCI was also crossing which indicates a buying trend. But, the 5/9 havent cross. It should have cross sooner, but the market was indecisive due to an announcement in UK which is not in FF calender. The price fell around 40pips! The indicator is now on extacy, so wait until it retraces back or wait until the US market opens. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Can you tell me the time frame please?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I believe we are looking at 4 hour, but you can see the action on other time frames

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #212 ---
This looks great, however I have noticed that the indicators are in Metatrader and I use Fibonacci trader software. Is there anyway to convert these or does anyone outhere know how to set these up for Fibtrader??? Thanks for any help u can give me.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I personally don't know anything about the Fibtrader. In addition to that, I have not seen any reply here that said someone knew how to convert MetaTrader indicators to another format. I think people typically download MT4 as demo and use it to analyze, then use their broker's platform for placing orders. I hope that helps you somehow...

--- 帖子 #214 ---
How did you find out about Tlatomi method a year ago? And why don't you post a real statement?:surprised

--- 帖子 #215 ---
There was a drop using SBFX (and some others like FXCM ) it occured for a period of ~10 hrs from ~10:30 EST to ~8:45 EST. It seem sto occur on the East Coast of the US. Be cautious using the indicators for awhile. When my data connection came back there was a gap when the 10 hrs of data should be. This will fool the indicator's caculations. For the 4hr indicator it will take 36hrs for the missing data to clear the system. I would think any signals on the 4hr chart during this period will be suspect. I don't know how long the polluted data will affect the other indicators.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I tested the Tlatomi + Tiga last night.....on demo I only entered properly on one trade.... (the good one ;D). I then started messing around with the idea on laying it on top of the 1/4hr tunnel method!!!! holy cow!!!!! I then got all excited and wanted to try a few lots live.....Was getting all the right signals from Tlat/Tig and Tunnels on the EUR/JPY......Then like A bone head I went a swinging for the fences and mistakenly placed a trade on the USD/JPY!!!!! ARRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!! Worse yet I got so mad about my mistake I went revenge hunting and lost more!!!!...... Lol since then I have been patient and placed another proper trade (following the rules laid out by the Orange man) I have recouped my losses from my earlier blunder. I will attach statements of my trades...... I really like these methods and indicators and Thank ALL of you who have contributed to them!!!! I am so impressed I have decided to join the James16 Group.....Just waiting on my authorization letter to come....... Ohhhhhhhhh! they just called me ......whoohooo they sending it now! All negative live trades were result of not following the method and then I went straddleing trying to recoupe losses. I dont fully understand these methods but I believe they work well. Thankyou all so much one more time!!!!! now off to the PF!!! Wooho!!!

--- 帖子 #217 ---
i also already tried the tlatomi and tiga abdul....today...and i have 2 winning trade (demo only...so sad...sumtimes human capital just dont enough) hope to see more development on this method.... maybe orange can come out with empat abdul or lima abdul or pendekar bujang lapuk method....hihih..just messing around.. thanks for the method, it really give me the pips....

--- 帖子 #218 ---
i´ve read this forum, and i find to use the system under the 4 hrs chart. my big question is: The method will work under daily charts? Or the method will work under any other time frame? If someone can help me figure this, i will appreciate. By the way, GREAT SYSTEM

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi. Im not a pro of anything. Im still a newbie(just as said on my name), but i think it does work on smaller time frame ( i think ). For tlatomi, it works from 1hr up to 4hr time frame. But smaller time frame means you need TIGA ABDUL. Take 1hr time frame for an example. When all tlatomi's give a buy/sell signal, keep an eye on TIGA ABDUL. 9SMA will tell you where the trend is going. Focus on your bar/candle stick and try to link it with the 5EMA. Notice the bar goes along with 5EMA? Say it is an up trend (5EMA is driving above 9SMA), look at the price movement from bar to bar. When bar 1 goes up, the second will go slightly down and touch the 5EMA and then go back up...and so on. To me, the best thing about tlatomi is that it gives me signals to make me fell more confident about the trade. As for tiga abdul, i love it espicially when trading on 30mins and 1hr time frame. Even if you missed the cross, that does not mean you have to wait for another cross. Just focus on the price movement and when it touches the 5EMA, ENTER! Why worry? All tlatomi's signal still give a buy/sell signal. If im wrong, please please please do correct me. Im just a newbie who wants to learn

--- 帖子 #220 ---

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I have read through this entire thread and I may have missed it but has anyone mentioned a stop/loss. I made three trades today on a M30 for the first time with this method. All of them good. PTL. I have been trading over 25 years. Knowing how to get out of a bad trade is very important as most of you know. What would be some ideas? My first thought is a cross of the 5/9 ma. in the other direction.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I've been giving it a try on the daily. It seems to work there too (with a little help from Vegas and a couple of modifications to indicators). 6 trades (blew one by looking at the wrong chart for a 20 pip loss). The others were all successful for approximately 150, 80, 60, 50 and 40 pips. All were closed out wherever they were on Friday, which is why some made much less. All were demos of course.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Nice if we had an EA to paper trade .... as this sitting in front of these screens 12 hrs a day to try out this method is really not good for the eyes and overall health. If anyone has put this in .. EA CODE would sure appreciate it if you could share it with us here .... trying to Paper Trade These Methods. Thanks all!!!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
A simple stoploss would be 10-20pips. It all depends on the volatility of the monkey you traded. Bearing in mind the win/loss ratio which should be minimum of 2:1. My trade usually set to 40/20 with taril stop of 10. I hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
This method works with all timeframes. But, method of trading it would differ greatly. However the safest timeframe is 4hr, second, the 1hr. Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Here are something that ive learned and implements before going into any trade. You can say, the preparation. 1. Grab a cup of Coffee! 2. Read fundamental outlook for the day from a professional source. But dont read too much as it overload your confidence. 3. Scan weekly &amp; Daily charts to determine the current trend 4. Trade with the trend 5. Iddentify buying/selling zones 6. Use Price Analysis &amp; Price actions by comparing different charts &amp; Spreadsheets. 7. Entry &amp; exit within your risk managemnt goal 8. Rate your confidence level on a scale of 1-5 9. Trade with your indicator 100% compliance! 10. Put on your stop losses and Profit limits. I hope this will help a bit. Thanks

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Except the first point, I agree 100 percent with you !!!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
: Coffee is already proven to have a very high anti-oxidant level. Hehehehee...

Nice checklist, OrangeRoshan! Yeah, I think a cup of joe can help us stay awake longer.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
There are many types of trader out there. See when you can iddentify which one are you: 1. The Cattle This type of trader likes to follow the majority. Very democratic but no personality. 2. The Black Sheep This trader likes to do the opposite what the others are doing. He/she believes in doing things differently. The black sheep favourite song is "My way". 3. The Sniper This trader will prepare him/herself before every trade. The trader will not trade until the situation is 100% favourable. He/she dont mind waiting hours &amp; hours before entering a trade. 4. The Samurai This trader will take every trades possible. Entering and exiting every trade without any emotion. He/she loves to trade. He/she doesnt care what other think. Honour is important. This trader loves Nike! 5. The Warrior This trader like to win only. Whenever this trader lose a trade, this trader will come back into the game again stronger and very confident. 6. The Gladiator This trader loves the attention from others. He/she doesnt care how he/she did it or what time he/she enter a trade. Winning is not important, trading gives him/her the kicks. 7. The duck hunter This trader will wait for the market to come and when it did, this trader will shotgun the trades hoping the majority of his/her trades wins. 8. The Ninja This trader will only trade on certain time. He/she is very careful with his every trade. This trader doesnt like waiting. He/she will trade on the exact time and exit the trade after that. 9. The Casanova This trader trades with multiple system. He/she seldom stick to the same system/s. This trader will continuely look for new system even the one available is already very very good. Loves to trade. 10. The Mother-in-law This trader is very choosy on which system to follow. Doesnt take any advice and very confident. When no system available to her/his liking, this trader will modified the existing system hoping it will work. Whenever this trader stumble upon a system he/she likes, this trader will use that system even though the system is not very profitable. This trader's moto is, "I LIKE". There are all profitable. All of them have advantage &amp; disadvantages. There are many other types, but these are the most wellknown types. Now, which one are you?

I'm still in the process of developing my style but my ideal would be "The Samurai" style. Fear happened to be the first emotion I had to face after I started trading forex so that's what I want to overcome first. Yeah, just do it!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi OrangeRoshan and all the other members ! I think we had come to a point in this thread, where the evolution of Tlatomi has reached a quite good level regarding the technical points ( chart setup, entry, exit... ) So my proposal would be to open a separate Tlatomi Thread, in which all the participants can put in their actual trades for accelarating the success curve. Each posted item should contain : 1. Image of the chart with all the mentioned indicators 2. Entry marking 3. Exit marking 4. Short comment I hope that it will be possible to start soon Happy Trading Bernhard

Hi all. i guess that out there is more than one -like me- who is not very used to the multiple frame hours. a made a small and simple comparative between mexico, ny, and londo hours, timing them to the tlatomi tiga metod and mt4. so it determines the hour of the clandlestick close, acording to the mt4 clock. in that way, when you are going to enter a trade, just watch the hour of the candlestick close, and go ahead. hope its usefull tnx

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Doens't that depend on where your broker's servers are located regardless of where you reside?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
thats what i´ve guessed, but with mt4, my charts always are on gmt0 regardless my zone

--- 帖子 #243 ---
At least with one of my brokers, their timezone is GMT +1. And another at GMT 0. So, my guess is that it all depends on your broker. I use the bar close alarm indicator and it's been helpful.

Enter trade immediatelly when the arrow come out.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I have been watching the forum and would first like to say this is a very impressive forum. I dont usually participate in any forums but I came across this one and it struck my interest. But here are my two cents concerning the Tlatomi . I hope it will help. Place the weekly and Monthly Pivots on your charts as they are very powerful support and resistance points. If you are already in a trade, you will want to scale out as the price approaches the weekly or monthly pivots by about 10 pips. If you are NOT in the trade but the Tlatomi signals are indicating an entry and the price is approaching the MP or WP within about 10 pips, wait to enter the trade until the price penetrates the WK or MP by AT LEAST 10 pips. This can make or break a potentially profitable trade. I will post an example of this as soon as the opportunity arises. MissForex

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Excellent tip!! Thanks

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I wonder if we could somehow get these indicators to work with E-signal?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I don't mean to diagree with you OrangeRoshan but two nights ago I was in the market on a Tlatomi trade. I was practicing on a M30 time frame and was in the EUR/USD and USD/CHF and the market started spiking. It went 30 pips and it look like the USD/JPY was going to give a signal. I bailed out of my two trades and took the signal in the JPY. Before the bar was closed the price had come all the way back and the signal, arrow, never happened. The other two trades that I closed out at a lost would have given me my profit objective. I do feel it is better to wait for the bar to close when entering. The averages are calculated on the closing price and you could jump the gun. I hate lossing on a trade and having the reason be "I broke the Rules".

--- 帖子 #254 ---
can you send me indicators for weekly and monthly pivots?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yes, it would be very nice if someone could post those indicators here.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Ok, 3 reasons: 1) 30M chart is too risky, I never recommend it 2) Donot jump on any trade until the arrow is painted, once the arrow is painted it stays painted. Never trade on the secondary signals. You may get lucky sometimes, but unfortunatelly not most of the time. The market has no mercy. 3) Losing trade is part of winning Try again only this time, get the indicators to tell you 100% ok signals. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Learn to say please, then maybe Missforex will give it to us!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
sorry for my mistake, please

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I don't know much about e-signal, but it looks like the e-signal platform is not as flexible as MT4 when it comes to adding custom indicators. You may want to open a demo account with one of those MT4-compatible brokers instead. Hmm...we are out of luck at this point because she does not use MT4.

These are what I have if you don't mind. Matsu

i have one suggestion. Put Shi_silvertrend on yr daily chart. Trade the direction of the dot whike combining with yr 4hr or 1hr/30mins entry exit.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Thanks for the suggestion - i'm going to test it.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Yes, I have them working. I understand the R1 and S1 etc. as support and resistence, but what are the Monthly lines. They are not labeled. Are they also R1 and S1 from the monthly bars? So is the solid Magenta colored line the Monthly Pivot? Now is there a post that explains what to do with these. I assume don't take Tlatomi signal to go long at a R1 or R2 and don't short near a S1 or S2. Is this right?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Greetings, I've been following this and its companion thread since inception and enjoying the posts/discussion and thought i'd share what i've been doodling with. Over the past few months i've been studying the GMMAs and incorporating them into my use of the Vegas Tunnel ported over to the shorter time frame charts. Below is a 5m chart with indicators/settings that are equivilent to much longer time frame charts. For instance, many of the emas are mathmaticaly indentical to those on a 30m chart, and the main tunnel with extensions is eqvuivilent to the 55 tunnel on a 4hr. I've adjusted the standard indicators such as the MA cross, SHI, and Ergo/CCI to roughly reflect those found on the longer TF charts. Then i zoom out and observe the momentum of the price about the various MAs for S/R and such. Also not seen on this, but placed on my 30m chart are the Median and TDL lines i place during my homework time. Anywhoo, that's what i'm up to, and enjoying the thread. just thought i'd share. : ) Thom http://accrete.com/fx-posts/FiboGMMAsOnEurUsd.gif

If you change your chart to daily, I think you can see 5 pivot lines with the magenta line in the middle.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I have the weekly pivots on one chart such as the 30 min and the monthly on the hr chart. That makes it easier to see instead of them all being crowded on one chart. They all act as S and R but the central pivots (majenta line) are the most powerful. If you look back on history, you will see that most of the time the currencies hover around the pivots for quite some time before actually penetrating them.(News releases are another story) Currencies will blow right thru the pivots during news.One other note, the GBP/JPY (volitile pair) does not respect the pivots as much as the other major currencies do. Minor S and R lies within the DAILY pivots. Again, the central DAILY pivot will be stronger than the rest. I place the daily pivots on smaller time frames such as the 5 min or 15 min. It helps to time the entry when you are approaching a possible tlatomi trade.I tried to attach the daily pivots and it didnt work. Maybe someone from the board could post them. MissForex

Finally done reading the thread and setting up my chart. Thanks heaps to all the contributors. Couple of questions (pardon me if they may sound stupid)... Tiga Adbul with Tlatomi: 1) Say DOT appear and CCI cross, how many candles normally before the Arrow (primary signal) appears? Is there a case not to take the trade if arrow is "late"? 2) Is this method primarily tested/used on GBP/USD and USD/JPY or GBP/JPY? Thanks in advanced. All the best!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
It has not been mentioned yet, I don't think, but last weekend when I was looking at all back trades I notice that it was better to skip the trade if the 5/9 cross didn't happen within 5 bars of the dot. This is just my observation. The system works on all pairs but those three work the best.

I never understand the implication of news on a technical system. We all do some kind of back testing, and the results seems good. I have certainly not taken any news days in consideration with my back testing. So why bother with the news?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
[quote=brainjt]sorry for my mistake, please[/QUOT This is one I've been using. It contains 4 sets of pivots. Just deselect the ones you don't want, or you can put them all on one chart, if you have a 60in monitor. These work well because they can be taken off by pulling up the indicator list and deleting them. Most of the pivot indicators I've tried had to be removed one line at a time as objects.

The SHI Silver Trend indicator is better than any I've seen. Combined with a little common sense and trading discipline and you've really got something. My hat is off to you. Don't try to improve it. Leave it alone, it's great!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Im releasing a companion or a replacement (it depends on your style) for the SHI. This is due to many of the contributors &amp; learners alike, favouring trading using 30mins and 1hr chart. Ive tried it this morning (afternoon EST) and found out it works really well with Entry/Exit and reentry/rexit between signals. Made only 120pips in 3hours trading. Thanks to MissForex, you pivots really simplified my Price Analysis in a more graphic ways, which I think will help newbies to appreciate PA. Anyway, Ive incorporated your pivot and it works like a crystal ball. I believe GBPUSD &amp; EURUSD will bounce up after exhausing itself on short today. Thank you all and lets continue to improve ourself mentaly by always ready to learn anytime any thread! Make Pips not War!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I was comparing Monthly Pivots and H1Vegas on H1 chart, and in my oppinion Vegas and mtfchannel (60M and 240M) serves better, than MPivots. I may be wrong, just a thought.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Is that a pin bar on the EURUSD daily chart? Combined with 4 hour chart looks like a sell signal.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
You are VERY welcome Orange. I am happy to contribute something for your hard work! MissForex

--- 帖子 #283 ---
You may be right to some degree but I'm pretty much sure that in your backtesting you could not tell from lookin at your 4-hour chart that indicators confirmed the move and EMA's crossed in a split second...regardless of what kind of formation you had right before the news.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I like your indicator, thanks!

Hi AP, I used WINZIP to open the documents. It's a free download, just google it. To run the system, I am using METATRADER 4.0, which is also free, offered by many brokers, including interbankfx. Hope this helps. best, forexpips

Dear All; The Tlatomi method appears to be great and it's really profitable. I wonder if there are Tlatomi indicators available for VT trading plateform.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
You don't need files for VT trading platform. Just get free Metatrader4. Use it for signals and trade with the broker you have. Go to Tlatomi Experience and see the charts we get with MT4. Then just open the trading platform of your own broker and make the trade.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
[quote=ejpdl] I don't see an easy way to adjust the colors. Under the colors section everything is set to black. I suspect it could be done in the code. Maybe a coder could take a look at it? I put them all on separate charts and tile the windows vertically. Monthly goes on 1 hr. Weekly on 30 mins. and Daily on 15 min. I use the daily chart along with Vegas currency daily. If you put the daily pivots on the D1, they would be too close together to be useful. Monthly would be more like it, or possibly the yearly pivots. I mostly trade based on pivots and price action, because this gets you in much earlier than waiting for a moving average cross. It's always good to have the tlatomi indicators confirm the move though. I think tlatomi is most useful on the longer charts. It is a great and simple system.

I am sure there are many newbies that appreciate this tip, as I do when others leave tips for me. Thanks for the code you all have shared! QUESTION: If any of you would be so kind to explain how to change time for MT4 for Eastern for example .... would appreciate it! I presume for an EA to work properly the time in MT4 must be the same as EA CODE. Any help here would be appreciated! My MT4 time is not even close! Thanks all!!!

Hi Abedewi, my advice to avoid that you became crazy to find out indicator for VT platform is to download Metatrader platform (it's free!), and open a demo account , then you can study tlatomi method applying all indicators on MT platform when you get an entry/exit signal you will go to you VT platform and place order Edit : Opps Tortoise had already answered in the same way to your question, i didn't see that post sorry

Does anyone know how to add an alert to the 5/9 corssover indicator. That would be helpful. Method works well, like all methods you have to be very careful around news and be aware when the market is whipsawing (like last Friday morning! EST).

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hey , I have a simple question. What if the yellow line comes first before the dot, arrow, cci cross and ma cross...Is it safe for me to trade?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hello All! Great thread, really great! Can someone please explain what the SHI_SilverTrendSig is in fact signalling/measuring? Regards,

--- 帖子 #302 ---
There is an alert on the dot appearing. (Post #127) I tried it and did not like it, so I took it off. However, once your get a set up you better be near your computer and ready to go. The cross has happened on the next bar and usually happens in the next 2 or 3 bars. Why would you need an alert? You know when the bars are going to close depending on the time frame you are trading. When the cross happens you better be there clicking your mouse. Don't depend on an alarm to wake you up. You snooze you loose.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
That is not the system. Read the orginal PDF on Post #1. The signals happen in order. The NonLag MA has been replaced with 5/9 MA for the final signal to execute the trade. (That is what I use now) 1. Dot appears 2. CCI cross before or on 5/9 cross 3. 5/9 cross 4. trade

--- 帖子 #304 ---
This is a good questions and one I had for judex001 when he got back Tuesday. I have found out that there is a list of over 450 custom indicators on another forum here at FF. SHI_SilverTrendSig is on that list. We may not know where it came from. I hope some one reading this furom can shed some light on what the SHI_SilverTrendSig is.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
In the US trading Europe, I would like to get the alert on the MA crossover rather than the dot appearance. This will be for the 30 min indicator. The other day I used an alert on price and missed about 25 pips by missing the cross over. So I did snooze and lose!

OK, I have the FX Snipper on my custom indicators list(MT4 platform) but when I click on it I can't get it to go onto my chart. Even the Interbank FX help desk can't tell me how to get it on the chart. All I get is a box that allows me to change the color of the indicator but when I click on OK, nothing happens. Any suggestions? Thanks

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Have you by any chance loaded a lot of indicators in your folder? Try to clean out some you will not need, to another folder. It seems there is a limit on the number of indicators in the custom indicator folder for MT4. I have found this by trial and error. Hope it works. Labrat407

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Labrat 407 I loaded only the three indicators needed for this trading strategy (nonLagMaV4,shi_silvertrendsig andFx Sniper erg cci)and only the Sniper went through to the custom indicator list. Can't figure why Siper indicator wont go on my chart when I click on it.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I'm assuming you have done this. Unzip files as necessary. Put them in C:/Program Files/MetaTrader/Experts/Indicators Restart MeteTrader program. From Insert menu, click Indicators, Custom and then you should find the indicators you downloaded in the list. Just click on one of them and change the setting as necessary. Repeat the process #4 two more times and you're done! Then click on the chart to highlight it. Go to the very top menu and select Charts&gt;Indicator List. See if your three custom indicators are list on that chart.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I went to that post you gave and they only talked about the NonLagMA. The question was for the SHI_SilverTrendSig. Where did that come from? (It is the little Dot we see on the chart. Did the same person write it?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Tortoise, I've done every thing on your list, the sniper comes up on the custom indicator list and when I click on it ,it doesnt go onto my chart. Maybe I haven't downloaded it properly.The other two indicators (shi_s and NonLagMaV4) didn't come over to the custom ind. list with the sniper cci but I would think the snipper should go onto my chart since it's on the list. I'm really looking forward to trying this strategy after I get these indicators on my platform. Any other ideas? Thank you

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Why did you replace the NonLag MA?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I'm a novice coder and I have put together an EA based the tiatomi method. I''m not sure how well it perform over time, but it did place the first order in the correct entry point. I used 2 SMA lines instead of the NonLagMA_v4 indicator. I could not get a workable code signal from this indicator. Attached is Bogie_tiatomi_v1.0 EA and SHI_SilverTrendSIG red/blue dot indicator. Also attach to chart two SMA indicators. Set 1 for red and period=5 and one for white and period=9. I use white, instead of blue, for 9 SMA line as for me it is easier to see on black background chart. H4 chart - right now only tested on gbp/usd. Can not backtest as timer for when Bar closes only works when EA is attached to chart. Order sequence Buy 1. SHI_SilverTrendSig indicator red dot appears. 2. Then after 1, EA waits until MA 5 cross above MA 9 3. Then after 1 &amp; 2, EA waits until current Bar closes. Close Buy when red dot is replaced by next blue dot. Sell 1. SHI_SilverTrendSig indicator blue dot appears. 2. Then after 1, EA waits until MA 5 cross below MA 9 3. Then after 1 &amp; 2, EA waits until current Bar closes. Close Sell when blue dot is replaced by next red dot. I may add when MA crosses back as part of close code. Dot color change or MA reverse cross. Either one would close order. But I think the dot color change always come first. The UD = 1 is for red dot and UD = -1 is for blue dot. I may take this out as you can see when the red or blue dot appears.

Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0 EA attached. Title corrected. Wackena

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Wackena regarding this on your EA! Appreciate your posting and working on this. 3. Then after 1 &amp; 2, EA waits until current Bar closes. If we use the 4 hour chart would it not be better, to skip the step 3 and just buy and or sell upon completion of step 2 the cross?. I realize that this may be better for the 1H chart as it may be better to wait for completion of the Bar, but on the 4 Hour, this appears to wait to long to either enter or exit? Any opinions regarding the 4H chart ?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
This is where experience from this thread comes in. To answer your question, I just don't know if H1 would be better than H4. I'm running on H4 gbp/usd demo as of today. i will also start a H1 to see the difference. Wackena

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I can't get the Bogie script to work. Nothing happens when I click it from the custom menu. The other one works however

--- 帖子 #322 ---
The Bogie script is an EA, not an indicator or script. It needs to be put in MetaTrader 4 experts folder. Then attached it from Experts folder to chart. Wackena.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Wackena I like this EA very much so far running well with FXDD no problems, however on EA, please explain USE CLOSE SIGNAL, which is True if it is changed to False does that mean whem the moving averages cross that a trade occurs, (immediately), as an earlier signal would be great on the 4H chart. currently (4) postions open all with profit. I believe that this will become a great EA in the near future. Also do you plan to change the MA 5 from Simple to Expendential as discussed for this actual method as the way the indicators make up this method, as this seems to be a better enty or exit point?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
We replaced the NonLagMA per suggestion of OrangeRoshan in combining part of the TIGA ABDUL with Tlatomi. He suggested the 5EMA and 9SMA cross. Watching the method on the charts you see time and time again it beats the NonLag MA by 1 or 2 bars and was a valid time to enter. See PDF file on Post 157 .

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Go to your Indicators folder and delete those files. If you can't find them to delete, then there is your problem. Download again and try it again. Find new files on Post #158

--- 帖子 #326 ---
txsundevil, I have changed the 5 SMA to 5 EMA and will repost EA soon. UseCloseSignal = true and EA uses dot change to close orders. UseCloseSignal = false and EA needs user to manually close order. StopLossMode = true and EA applies input Stoploss to order StopLossMode = false and no Stoploss is applied to order. If TrailingStop = 0, then no trailing stop is used. Wackena

I'm on the MT4 platform. The platform isn't allowing me to change the color of the Shi_ dots to 0=blue and1=red . When I hit OK, dots remain the same color(0=red,1=blue) when chart comes up. Any suggestions? thank you

--- 帖子 #329 ---
hmmmmmmmmm looks like I missed something. Is there an EA for the tlatomi method in development? Thanks! MissForex

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0 is an EA and needs to be placed in the experts folder. Wackena.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Attached is modified EA. I still not sure it is operating correctly. I need to see more how it opens and closes orders. So, at present use with caution. Wackena

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Wackena, I did the same as you, to copy the code from SHI_SilverTrendSig because this indicator doesn't work if called from iCustomer. But the code in it is very confusing as below: if (Close[SH]&lt;SHMin+(SHMax-SHMin)*Otstup/100 &amp;&amp; UD!=SH_SELL) { BufU[SH]=Low[SH]-R*0.5; UD=SH_SELL; } if (Close[SH]&gt;SHMax-(SHMax-SHMin)*Otstup/100 &amp;&amp; UD!=SH_BUY) { BufD[SH]=High[SH]+R*0.5; UD=SH_BUY; } From what I saw and tested, the first "if" line draws a red dot below the price, which should be a buy signal. Then the second line should be sell. Please check your EA code, I think you did it reversely. Anyway, I tested by using this indicator only, the profit rate is almost 50% so it doesn't make big difference if using it correctly or not. As what I understood, the difference of this system between other MA cross systems are the two indicators, while one of them doesn't look well to me.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
TY for your reply!

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Does the EA have FXsniper cross? I have been using this method quite a while and the pattern of H4 and M30 are the same. I have always referred to M30 before making entry. In fact i made more profits when i apply this method for m30. Wackena, can you add another feature of secure profits @ secure pips? So that when one has made more than 10 pips, if the market turns back, he still get 10 pip profit. Well, the value can be changed up to the user. I also attach RSI 4 &amp; 14, zerolagstoch as to confirm my entry. So far 100% win. Regards

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Kenari05. Read around original post #315 and 2nd post #331. These will explain entry and exit. You can use the TrailingStop feature to secure positive pips. Can you post a chart example with RSI and zerolagstoch to show how you use them? Wackena

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I attached zerolagstoch as closing signal or reversal... the worst scenario is break even. RSI is good to consider. RSI 4 for current move, RSI 14 for mid term. http://img135.imageshack.us/img135/6383/viewlo3.jpg

HI everyone, I have one little problem, sometimes when red/blue dot appears its time to open short/long, but sometimes this dott DISSAPPEAR and appears new one - I dont know if there is problem or if it is everything ok Thank you for your advices

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I,ve downloaded all the zip indicators to the MT4 platform. I can't make heads or tails over the Shi_SilverTrend SigAlert. I just got an alert saying (EUR/JPY M60 Cross Buy) but my chart shows a red dot, FX Siper crossing down and my 5MA crossing down over the 9MA. My question is why I,m I getting an alert to buy when all the other indicators are to sell? Also ,I'm getting like three alerts at a time within two seconds as if one alert has triggered the next two. But again, these alerts are sometimes telling me to do the opposite of what my other indicators are telling me. Can anyone help me with this problem? It's very imortant to me that this alert system is working properly because of the job I have and not being able to watch the computer constantly. I do want to thank the originaters of this super system.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Yesterday I installed Bogie_Tlatomi_v1.0a and started a test. Today there were two trades: sell on EURUSD and sell on GBPUSD - see the statement attached. Both trades was closed in profit by the software using SL. This function was probably triggered by setting UseCloseSignal=1. BTW I do not know how the the SL point was calculated, I would appreciate if I could get some information about that. My settings were: UseMM=0 Risk=5.00000000 Lots=0.10000000 UseCloseSignal=1 TrailingStop=20.00000000 TakeProfit=34.00000000 StopLossMode=1 StopLoss=377.00000000 AllBars=0 Otstup=30 Per=9.00000000 So, it was a profitable start, Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0a is a promising new EA. Thank you Wackena for your valuable work!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
A1Cruiser, The TrailingStop (ts) has adjusted the StopLoss (sl) on both orders. This means on a sell order, the Ask has moved down more than the ts = 20 pips below entry price. This triggered the sl to be modified to Ask + 5 pips. Then if Ask keeps moving down another ts = 20 pips below new sl, the sl is modified again to Ask + 5 pips and etc. On the eur/usd order with 32 pips profit, the sl was reset two times. You should be able to check Journal report and see two modify entries. The gbp/usd order had the sl modified one time. I think this is how it works. Wackena

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hello judex001 and others I´ve made some modifications to the original method trying to avoid the SHI_silvertrend_signal. First, I´ve modified one indicator to show in chart window the crosses of the FX Sniper´s ergodic CCI Trigger. Then I added some MA, and discarded SHI_silvertrend_signal and added a Zig Zag based indicator . Like all zigzag indicator, previous low and previous high can be modified any time due to price action, but in 4h the repaints are not common or, not in the same way like SHI_silvertrend _signal does. Pls, see the picture.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I have been using the EA for 3 days now. I have all the indicators and knowledge of the original method and the updated versions. I see it opens positions where there is no signal.... Just wondering what the justification is for the positions?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Wackena, Thank you for the explanation, you were right. I will continue the test next week.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hello, I have exactly the same problem. I am testing Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0a. I tried EURUSD, GBPJPY, GBPUSD on M30, H1, H4, it opens trades randomly ignoring the rules. They usually go in the wrong direction. I hope Wackena can help.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Wackena, I've been waiting for someone with enough knowledge to come up with an EA. Thank you very much for that. I would like to ask you one thing though, if you please, add an e-mail notification to your EA, so if there is any activity on the account (buy/sell) e-mail will be sent to notify about the change. Again, thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
As many have found out, the orignal posted EA did not totally operate as intended. It was also placing some orders opposite to desired long or short direction. It took awhile, but I think I found the reason. Attached is modified EA with the following extras. 1. UseMM - Option to use Money Management to set lot size based on Risk % of AccountEquity. 2. UseDot - Option to use Calculated Red - Blue dot location for order entry 3. UseCross - Option to use 5EMA &amp; 9SMA cross for order entry. 4. UseStartBar - Option to use start of new bar for order entry. (These 3 features can be used alone or in any combination for order entry) Order exit is now when Dot value changes and 5EMA - 9SMA reverse cross. In backtest, using Dot value only for order entry produced best results on H4 charts. Lower timeframe chart selections did not backtest well. 5. TrailingStop 6. UseHedgeOrder - Option to place hedge order if main order moves in wrong direction wth parameter set that can be set different than main order. If problems are found, please advise and I will try to correct. If any additonal technical indicators would like to be used as compliment to order entry or exit, please advise and I will try to include in EA. This EA is a work in process. For me, the best improvements in an EA comes from the people that test it and provide feedback. This feedback needs to confirm the good and point out the bad aspects. Wackena

Dear All; I think the Tlatomi method is an impressive method that can be applied profitablly to more pairs than those originally suggested by the creator. I need help with regard to a finding on the metatrader plateform. The silver indicator "generating the dots" changes the position of the dots when I refresh the chart or edit the indicator properties for example such as the visualization settings of the indicator. This displacement is about one or two bars away. I'd like to know if this is normal or not and how can I make sure the dots don't change thier positions. Thanks for help Ahmad

Regarding the New EA Bogie_Tlatomi_v1.0b Everything Ok, except it opened up USD/CHF in the worong direction a BUY, up over $109 on GBP/USD since last night on .01 lots, however seems to be opening up againwhen I close it reopens in the wrong direction only so far for USD/CHF, other's words fine is it a bug or am I doing something wrong, I reversed on my own by taking it off the chart and now showing profit?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I Also had a usd/chf Buy order placed at 0500 GMT entry price 1.2363 and a eur/chf Buy order placed at 1300 GMT entry price 1.5799. Reviewing H4 charts, both appear to have been placed in wrong direction. I don't know why, I will try to investigate. Wackena

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Wackena Thank's in advance for trying to correct this looked at the 4H chart for CHF/USD it showed a buy at 1.2364, not near the dot and the cross the other curriences were fine. GPB profit of $92 on 0.1 lot and $27 on 0.1 Lot EUR closed postions. Would like to try MM, when you update and correct the EA. current an AUD/USD is open with profit of $12 on 0.1 lot, correct entry.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
txsundevil, Are you on H4 only or H4 and H1 ? wackena, New EA works so far. 1 trade on GBPUSD H4. 78 pips profit ! Thanks for your work ! BTW I can only refresh Silver Trend Indicator when I remove it from the chart and put it back on. Is it normal ?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Wackena, You have built a nice range of external variables! Thank you for your hard work. The earlier version opened a position to the wrong direction on EURUSD pair for me this morning as well. Hopefully that bug has been fixed in Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0b. A thought about the hedging function: Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0b opens two market orders (one buy and one sell) at the same time. So one of them goes against us while the other goes to profit. According to the best case scenario the first one then the other takes profit, but in the worst case scenario the first one then the other will stop out - depending on the market movement. Other strategies such as news trading straddles open pending orders both sides of trade (buy and sell). Once the first pending order has been activated the other side is liquidated and the positive is used to go to profit direction. (I think the same method could also be considered in case of Firebird 1.0b versions.)

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi Wackena ! I've attached your latest version of bogie_tlatomi to my GBP/USD 15 min Chart but no order was placed, when the two EMA's crossed each other. I want bogie_tlatomi to buy/sell when the EMA's cross each other. Where is the fault ?? Greetings Bernhard

--- 帖子 #370 ---
txsundevil, (tom) Are you on H4 only or H4 and H1 ? Only on H4, and as stated do not run the CHF curriencies since they are not currently placing orders correctly until the EA is updated. Since GPB &amp; EUR, seem to trend well may try 1H on those but when you look at 1H charts it appears very tight in most circumstanes to make a profit, seem to be alot of whipsaws even with the 1H charts especially CAD &amp; AUD. EUR/JPY appears to be a very good trending currency several times a month on the 4H chart.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Bernhard, In backtesting, H4 chart was the only chart selection that produced positive results. The EA and SHI_SilverTrend_SIG indicator use the Highest and lowest function to determine reverse trend point. They are set to scan previous 9 periods for highest and lowest values. I can only assume that 9 H4 periods is the best scan range for valid reverse points. Anything less and data is suspect. If needed, in the future, I will investigate to let EA scan H4 range even when on lower timeframe chart selections to see what happens. Wackena Wackena

--- 帖子 #372 ---
thanks txsundevil, I tried GBPUSD on M30. Trade in the wrong direction. Silver Trend and MA Crossover indicators do not refresh whatever I try except when I remove them and reapply to the charts. I will stay with H4 now. Does anyone have similar problems with indicators ?

--- 帖子 #373 ---
basically the SHI and ZigZag are doing pretty much the same thing I think. They are both referencing past price moves to predict the future. I think Judex intended the SHI to be nothing more than an early warning system. The system actually trades on the basis of the non lag MA or 5-9MA cross plus the cross of the Ergodic CCI. Probably the only real use of the SHI or Zig Zag as such is to note whether the dots or the points are ascending or descending. That can give you an idea of which way the cross should go. neither of these indicators is suitable for actual trading. You might want to look at Akuma99's blog (just Google Akuma99). He has a page on the proper use of the Zig Zag indicators. It's just not really that important to the method and could be left completely out. You can just use a ema crossover signal in place of it. That will let you know when a trade is available too.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Thanks Wackena, for the great job! I put EA on a live test on H4 chart, also I selected only H4 chart for SilverTrend dots (just in case if the previous confusion was created by inputs from other TF - most probably it is just superstition, but let's see). I put the EA on live trading from dot to dot (thank you again), but if SilverTrend needs to be refreshed every 4 hours to have dots placed on the chart, how about EA? As I understood - the EA calculates signals the way SilverTrend does, so even if SilverTrend didn't put a dot on the chart, the EA still calculates the dot signal and would enter the trade as if the dot would be there, right? Or am I mistaken? Good day to you.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
The expert failed to notice an exit signal on u/chf and u/cad long. So basically I give up testing it. The fact it went from +20 to -34 in a few hours was enough for me. I dont think this method can be programmed.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
This EA is still in it's early stages give it a chance it is working on GBP, EUR, AUD, yes it failed to give the signal for the CAD, and the CHF is in the wrong direction, it still is a fairly good EA, and remember you can override once in a trade your stops profit taking etc. You also have to be patient for the setups, the question I have is why not let the EA place orders at the cross, seems to be a very good entry place with little risk, just look at the 4H charts.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Yes, I believe that to be true. Both EA and Indicator have current data. The Indicator just doesn't keep dots current. I will post Indicator on this and Metaquotes forums and ask if someone can explain why this is so. And if there is a cure. Wackena.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Attached is Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0c. Added features and changes are: 1. UseEmail - if true, sends email notifications to recipient as setup in the Opiton's Email. Email on open orders. And, if UseCloseSignal=true, Email on order closings. 2. Exit trigger reverted back to new dot appearing only. Exit trigger in v1.0b was new dot appearance and 5ema &amp; 9sma reverse cross. After a day of reviewing demo order closing, I believe some profits were lost after new dot appeared and then waiting for reverse cross. Now we have several EA versions and it can become confusing to new thread members and in fact to me also. But, this is a developing EA and changes will happen. I'm getting several PMs from new members, and in most cases asking for already posted or discussed information. I highly suggest that each new member start at the beginning of this thread and read it carefully. Believe me, this will answer a lot of yor initial questions and then you can be near to "up to speed" as most of the rest of us. Then if you have questions, please post questions here on this thread or contact me via PM. Wackena

I tested the EA on Gold Futures and so far so good. First trade is in the positive Well done.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Is there a chance the use email feature can contain a mail list, which will send mail to all the email addresses listed?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I don't know. The only email feature that I'm aware of for MT4 is only one email address. You use the forward function in Outlook or whatever email software you have to send to multiple addresses. Wackena

Im testing the new bogie tlatomi (just added 2 post abvove). I want to know what are going to be the default settings for this test, so all of us can have same settings and later we can compare our results.

I uploaded the bogie tlatomi (c version) to my mt, but no trades are made (the expert button, and all the correct setting under expert tab are running). anyone can guess why?. Also, y have attached to the graphic that is running the ea, the indicator of tlatomi, this could be the error?. tnx in advance

Hi tortoise, Again, sorry for the delay. I found this indicator on a russian website - i think that's the programer team website. If you want to take a look : http://www.viac.ru/ I don't know exactly how it works but my guess is that's similar to the zig zag indicator : a dot appears when the price goes up or goes down of a certain percentage. This percentage is based on the prices of the last X bars (that's why the dots repaint themselves). --- If somebody has a better explanation - don't hesitate --- I also found two malasians forum (not sure) whose have a thread about the tiga tlatomi method. http://nogold.com/forum/forex/13237-...e-tlatomi.html http://www.borneomoneymaker.com/foru...hread.php?t=58 I'm unable to translate but perhaps there are some good informations or parameters...

hi, How is Tlatomi method doing with you? Does it still maintain good result so far? Sorry, I havent had a chance to try on the demo. I dont really trust the backtesting, so I dont believe in the result from it. I think backtesting adjusts itself. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
It's easy with Mozilla Thunderbird. Just set up a message filter to forward anything with specified keywords.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I noticed one very, very little flaw with version 1.0c. On my forward testing demo, it was only placing buys, no sells. Ha! Ha!. Even so, most Buys closed with profit. Attached is corrected EA. As a novice coder, I do make some mistakes. Sorry, for the inconvenience. Also attached is demo results from Aug 29.I started the week with 1.0b and I loaded 1.0c midday on the 29th. You can see all the buys from that point. This week, tlatomi is averaging just over 75% wins. Using Money Management with risk 5%, p/l=829.20, Equity=642.86 and Float p/l=200.14. It's too early to say it is a good EA, but so far, not that bad. Wackena

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Error 4109 is "Trade is not allowed". I've never seen this error code in any EA testing. I'm not sure what would triggered this error. Maybe someone has experience and can respond. Wackena

I try running Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0d but i got this message 2006.08.30 11:47:38 Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0d GBPUSD,H4: Error opening SELL order : 4060

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Error 4060 is "Function is not confirmed". Again, I never seen 4060 and 4109 errors appear before. I"m running v1.0d demo OK. The only new item that may cause this, is the email option. Make sure if you have UseEmail=true, that the email option in MT4 is setup. If Mt4 email option is not setup, set UseEmail=false and see if error continues. Wackena

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Not to sound computer illiterate, how does one install the indicators to their platform? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
i also got problem on running it. is it correct my installation path for the latest version C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators

--- 帖子 #394 ---
That is the right place for indicators, but you will put the expert in the experts, and not the idicators directory.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I was using version c, but found it would not do sell orders, only buys. None the less, still made 7% in my demo account this week. Installed version d, and sells are opening fine now.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Wackena, Thanks for the update. Your ver.d is working great, I am also getting my e-mail notifications on my mobile. One question though, i set my trailing stop at 5.0., it worked fine on your previous ver., at this moment i am short on usdchf, and 7 pips in profit, but trailing stop hasn't been activated yet? Is that a glitch, or am I doing something wrong? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Michaelw, For a short trailing stop to trigger, 2 items must happen. One, order entry price minus Ask must be greater than trailing stop . And two, order stoploss must be greater than Ask plus trailing stop . Also, the new stoploss would be the Ask+ 5 pips. With the currency spread, 7 pips is borderline , but could trigger, if it stayed 7 pips or more long enough. Your journal should show if modify order was attempted. Also, I just don't know how broker's servers react when it's this close. Wackena

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I hate doing this question, but i´ve re-installed several times the ea, and it does´t work at all: i put the ea on MT FOLDER/EXPERTS and the indicators on MT FOLDER/EXPERTS/INDICATOR and the preset on MT FOLDER/EXPERTS/PRESET and the ea should run, but that doesnt happend Also im running the EA under 4hout time frame (is this right?) can anybody post the indicators they are actually using (i think i got old version of them). tnx to all

This is what im going crazy with this: Using MT4 H4 chart smily face in top right EA option correctly displayed under the EA tab under options Since your EA call the indicators, i think that my problem are the ones that im using. Is there any chance you can post the ones you are using

--- 帖子 #404 ---
The Ea doesn't call the indicator. The EA runs totally independent. Use indicators for graghical display on charts only. I've modified the signal indicator to show up and down arrows instead of dots. Indicator is attached. Wackena

Hi, to everybody who has a problem with opening trades. I had it also, but yours might be a different one. Here I just want to explain what happened to my account: I opened a small mini account with $600 in it just for trying this method (that's how much I believe in it!). So, by default, the risk level is 5, it means that only 5% of all equity in the account I am willing to risk per trade. How much is 5% from $600? You got the picture. No trades were opened. I didn't want to risk more than $600, so I just increased risk level to 25. And that worked - trades were opened (in wrong direction, though, but now we have that also corrected ). Good day to everybody.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
any latest updates on the indicator script and compiled in one place? i still cannot execute the indicator in mt4. might be the correct easy installation and settings will be helpful

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hi, I do not understand your question, but I will tell you in general. Any indicator, any Expert Advisor, any script you download to your MT4 program you should save them in the folder where they belong: indicator in the Indicators folder, Expert Advisor in Experts folder, scripts into Scripts folder. If you already know this, don't mind. If not, I will explain so you'd understand it forever: the source code that we download is not an executable computer program. Any computer program, doesn't matter how small, should be compiled before it can work. So open MetaEditor and through it open the newly downloaded file and click on COMPILE. That will produce an executable code for a computer to work with. Then simply close the file and the MetaEditor. There is no need to save an executable file. While closing it, the MetaEditor will save it authomatically. That's it. Now you can attach the Expert Advisor to the chart and it will leave the smiley for you. Also make sure that ExpertAdvisors are not blocked. Basically you should compile everything that you download for trading, at least to see that there are no errors or warnings in the program. The only exception is when you got an executable file to download. Sometimes it happens. The files extension is .ex4 - that means it is in binary format ready to execute - already compiled. Those work at instant, but not many of them are distributed and better not to mess with them, because you don't know what's in there. That's it. Good day to you.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
i compile with success. but still cannot execute. in mt4 log, loaded succesfully but then in split second, it has been removed see attachment

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I'd say look at the logs. Double click on the one that says EA was removed. This will open you a log file at that time, and there sometimes you can see the reason for it: either it is some internal error, or whatever.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Once again. What you posted is a journal. Look next in the Experts. That's where Experts logs are. And then doubleclick.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Wackena I looked at the statement file, and visually checked the chart to see what was going on with gbp/usd at that time. There are some changes to be made to the EA, because you got stopped out of perfectly good and profitable trades, but now you are hanging with minus 46 pips and s/l that took you out of a very profitable trade, didn't work this time? Doesn't make much sense to me. Also I'd suggest while testing the EA don't use MM , but rather 0.1 lot or 1 lot so the profit/loss could be calculated in pips rather than money.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Although the current version executes sells, have had many more losses since you fixed this feature. Not sure why, or if I am the only person experiencing this. I have it running in 2 demo accounts and found in one it opened and closed multiple orders on the same currency taking a loss based on the spread. Not sure why it did this. Not complaining, grateful for all you are doing, hope this feedback helps!

--- 帖子 #415 ---
After you install the EA, shut down MT4 and reopen then add your EA to the chart. Miss Forex

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hey Wackena, I have one more question for you. Once one of the positions close (most of the time with gain) boogie_tlatomi_d will open another one automatically, replacing the old one. Most of the time I lose on it, samething happens when I close a postition manually. Is it fixable?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hello Wackena, Thank you for your great work ! I am testing version d and looks like UseCross=true does not do anything. If I understend correctly UseDots=true, UseCross=true, UseStartNewBar=false should work as follows: 1. Wait for dot 2. Wait for cross 5/9 3. Entry But version d places trade imidiately after the dot appears ignoring UseCross=true. Do I do something wrong ?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
tomstaufer, Michaelw, Both comments are valid. The UseDot, UseCross and UseStartNewBar selection routine was not working properly. I have corrected that and also modified the UseDot so that now its requires 2 bars in sequence with same signal before it triggers. I hope it emulates the effect of refireshing the dot and it doesn't move. I hope this keeps the EA from entering a position too early. Michaelw, now the UseCross is working, if=true, should not enter order until 5EMA crosses 9SMA again. Thanks again and please keep me advise of these types of observations. Attached is: Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0e with UseDot, UseCross and UseStartNewBar selection routine fix. Bogie_tlatomi_v1.0f with both UseDot, UseCross and UseStartNewBar selection routine fix and 2 bars in sequence addition. Wackena

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Wackena Thank's for the updates, have a question you mentioned two bars in sequence, on a 4H chart isn't that 8 hours since each bar is 4Hours? another thing did you find it more profitable just using the dot then waiting for the cross?, just looking at the 4 hour chart's the cross appears to be enough to enter at least most of the trades my eye see's on the chart, don't see much whipsaw on the 4H with EUR,GBP,CHF except of course during news release etc. what is you opinion of these items. thanks! Paul

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Yes, the 2 bars on H4 chart is 8 hours. I think this option will be currency pair specific. In backtest only, it made almost no difference in profits on eur/usd. But had a big positive effect on gbp/usd. Maybe there is a way to adjust the backwards scan to less than 8 hours on H4 chart and still be useful. So far, trading Dot to Dot has been best on gross profit. But, the float is going up over time. It seems that early entry could be a major part of this float. Now that the UseCross is fixed, I hope it helps control the float. On the other side, it could reduce volume of trades, making trading dot to dot sitll the best. it's too early to say which is best over time. Wackena

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Wackena, What functions do "usestartnewbar" and "useclosesignal" have? Thanks.

Short after the installation it opened a buy trade on EURUSD though the EMA cross showed to the other direction - as far as I was able to judge. &lt;table class="MsoNormalTable" style="width: 432.85pt; margin-left: 2.75pt; border-collapse: collapse;" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="577"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr style="height: 12.75pt;"&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 81pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="108"&gt; Open Time&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 37.25pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="50"&gt; Type&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 36.25pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="48"&gt; Lots&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 40.35pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; Item&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 40.35pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; Price&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 40.35pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; S / L&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 40.35pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; T / P&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 40.35pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; Price&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 38.3pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="51"&gt; Swap&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; background: silver none repeat scroll 0% 50%; width: 38.3pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="51"&gt; Profit&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr style="height: 12.75pt;"&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 81pt; height: 12.75pt;" nowrap="nowrap" valign="bottom" width="108"&gt; 2006.08.31 23:21&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 37.25pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="50"&gt; buy&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 36.25pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="48"&gt; 0.10&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 40.35pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; eurusd&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 40.35pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; 1,2818&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 40.35pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; 0,0000&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 40.35pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; 0,0000&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 40.35pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="54"&gt; 1,2808&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 38.3pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="51"&gt; -0.40&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style="padding: 0cm 3.5pt; width: 38.3pt; height: 12.75pt;" valign="bottom" width="51"&gt; -10.00&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; I attached the screenshot and the preset file here.

With the yellow line is 5EMA and white line is 9SMA, the order look premature. I need to assure the 5EMA and 9SMA code in EA is the same as the indicator. Take a look and advise if something is different. Inserted Code double myMA1 =iMA(NULL,0,5,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_CLOSE,0); double myMA2 =iMA(NULL,0,9,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_CLOSE,0); Below is the Cross code. It is fairly simple. Again, do we see anything wrong. Inserted Code if( UD &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; UseDots==true) a1=1; // Buy signal = 1, Sell signal = -1 if( myMA1 &gt;= myMA2 &amp;&amp; UseCross==true) b1=1; // 5EMA greater than 9SMA if( m ==0 &amp;&amp; UseStartNewBar==true) c1=1; // M=0, end of bar and start of new bar if(a1==1 &amp;&amp; b1!=1 &amp;&amp; c1!=1) Buy1=1; // Dot to dot if(a1==1 &amp;&amp; b1==1 &amp;&amp; c1!=1) Buy1=2; // Dot to dot &amp; 5EMA/9SMA cross if(a1==1 &amp;&amp; b1==1 &amp;&amp; c1==1) Buy1=3; // Dot to dot &amp; 5EMA/9SMA cross &amp; start of new bar. Anything obvious? Wackena

I did a few backtests on different currency pairs with v1.0e &amp; v1.0f. I don't totally trust backtest results, but they may be abie to determine general difference between EAs. Attached are the backtest results. The tlatomi method, I believe, was first dveloped for gbpusd pair. The results show the EAs likes gbpusd and eurusd, but others tested were not as good. For members that are demo testing these EAs, please advise if you see performance difference between pairs. Wackena

--- 帖子 #425 ---
UseStartNewBar is option for waiting until start of new bar before trading. UseCloseSignal is option for using reverse trade signal to close orders. Example: Buy order closes when new Sell signal is generated. If =false, uses TakeProfit and StopLoss values to close order. Wackena

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hey Wackena, Can you take a look at this MA indicator, and see if it can be implemented with bogie_tlatomi? or even become ea of its own? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Wackena, Thank you for the investigation. Well, the assumption is right, on the image the yellow line is 5 EMA (Close) and the white line is 9 SMA (Close). So the code you use is the same as you can see on the image. Well, I do not see any bug in the code but unfortunately I am not good at coding.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
In the meantime there is a new order on GBPUSD that is similar to that one discussed earlier: Date: 2006.09.01 Time: 16:16 (Broker time = GMT+3) Buy Price: 1.8973 The 5 EMA is clearly below the 9 SMA, the UD = 1; the settings are the same (see attached files).

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I'm seeing the same thing on my v1.0f $5,000 demo started 1700 EDT yesterday on 9 pairs. Even so, the account has: Balance 5,136.59 (3 wins - 1 loss) equity 5,305.37 Float - +168.78 (4 open orders) I will keep reviewing EA to understand this phenomenon. Wackena

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Well, my balance is also in profit (approx. 5,220 on an account started Sunday evening with 5,000) with a negative float (approx. 113). I usually closed the profitable orders manually, if I did not they intended to go back to loss. So, the overall performance is good, this EA is a promising one. I like that it does not open a lot of orders and the float is typically low. I am ready to test it further.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi Wackena, I also have similar problem: version e UseDot=true UseCross=true SHI Silver Trend shows SHORT but 5/9 cross shows LONG. Trade taken: sell So looks like EA does not look which way the MA cross goes. I think in this case EA should not enter the trade.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi, Wackena, It is interesting to know how the boolean things are working in MQL4's nested loops, lets say if some condition is true - and that condition is inside a loop, and after the loop there is some result/output which calls to action, so the action is performed (lets say BUY), and then the next iteration of loop starts again, because the condition is still true? Right? Well, I didn't look at the code (again too busy) but what you have posted here is a condition not of a cross of MAs, but just one beeing of a bigger value than the other. This is a condition that can last quite for a while, until next cross. Maybe I am wrong, then I am sorry for putting my 2 pennies where they don't belong. But I would really appreciate if you'd explain it to me. Thanks in advance, and thank you for all the work and dedication helping here.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
lietuve, Your comments, I believe are correct. The intent of the EA is in 3 optons. 1. The trend indicator dot has changed. 2. The 5ema is above 9sma for Buy and below for sell. 3. A new bar has just started. ( just a note that if trading option 1 alone or 1&amp;2, you will see on H4 chart that most trades happen at the top of the hour(new bar start). This is due to dot change also happens after start of new bar.) Afer the dot change, the cross does not need to be pending. It just needs to confirm the 5ema is above for buy and below for sell. I don't know if it's better after dot change that the cross must be pending and then wait until the cross happens. A pending cross option can be added. I will test. Well, that's the intent. The present problem is that EA is not confirming correct MA positions be opening trade position. I'm testing adding a buffer value to 5ema and that seems to work. You can see the 5ema and 9sma values on each chart. They change in value on every chart update. The Buy/Sell signals need to =1 to trigger trade and are reset =0 on each loop before signal calculations. There is no possibility of repeat looping of same trade signal. Wackena

wow...very amazing ...i just leave this thread for 2 weeks..and there's already alot of development on tlatomi...the boogieman...hmmmm...this method is so awesome...i had straight 44 wining trade in 10 days trading....thanks judex and orange...for this method...

--- 帖子 #435 ---
With all my respect to the work you've done, I should say that in regards to the mas and dots you are wrong. We've chosen this indicator, because it reacts to the market conditions better than any other that I know of; The appearance of a new dot on the chart signals the very big probability of the change in trend; the dot more often than not signals the bar where the change is going to take place. That's the beauty of Silver Trend. No doubts, that any lagging indicator, as ma, would be pointing to the direction of an old trend at that moment. So if you want MAs to confirm the change of the trend, the EA has to wait for the MAs cross to appear, quite a few bars after the dot was placed. That would be quite late entry into the market in most cases. But if after the appearance of a dot, the EA is "confirming" the trend beeing up because 5ema is above the 9sma, and initiates buy, no doubt 85% of the time it is a lost trade. If EA would wait until mas'd cross in the direction of the one indicated by the dot, in a longer TF the trade'd would be lost as well, or with a very little profit, because on the longer TF MAs are not profitable, especially in a ranging or sideways market. Try this: let's say a "sell" dot has appeared and 5ema is above 9 sma - make this a condition to sell. When the emas cross, make a 2nd sell (this time following mas signal), and exit both trades as a "buy" dot appears. At the same time EA might execute 1 trade in the direction of a dot "buy" even when the 5ema is below 9sma. But the second trade of buy should be confirmed by a cross of mas. Try this setup and see what happens. Don't believe me, just try. And let us know the results. Thanks again for your efforts and patience. I know you did a wonderful EA - the "Fenix", everybody is excited about it, but every EA is based on a different logic, so what is good for Fenix (multiple trades, big expose to the market, having floats) is not good for Tlatami. The style should be changed. I wonder what OrangeRoshan is dooing. He is extremely intelligent and smart man, most probably he would have something better to say than I, but even me, I know that the method is good, all we need now is - refine it the proper way. You are the person that could do it and thank you for that. Deep regards.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Are you still unhappy about that trade?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Thank you for your posts, you have several interesting points. I am really curious to know Wackena's opinion about your ideas. You might be right, our tests are going to clear it. Well, that trade was closed manually on 1 Sep in 19 profit. There is no problem at all, because: we are in a testing and developing period and I trade Bogie_Tlatomi only on a demo account. So, I think in this phase the point is that we should make clear for ourselves the characteristics of the EA and improve it if it is necessary and possible. (As for me, I am just capable of testing and telling you my experiences ...) Well, now I have a EURUSD and a GBPUSD trades open both of them are floating in negative. Both are opened on SilverTrend signal and against the MAs signal. In the meantime there appeared another dot signalling "sell" orders whilst the MAs show "buy" orders. We will see what happens at the end.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
lietuve, I think this is a good idea. Yesterday, I put together an EA based on your idea. In that the EA places 1st order on appearance of new dot. 2nd order is placed when 5ema and 9sma cross. Example: for buy, when 5ema crosses above 9SMA. I want to demo test for awhile and if operates OK, I will post. Wackena

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Please can somebody post here image of SHI_SilverTrendSig.mq4 on 15M timeframe on period 31.8 22:00 - 1.9 8:00 ? i just want to comfirm my setting cause it show me several dots there although i know that its not created for this timeframe.. Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I have the EA open, its short a/u e/u g/u. Now you see they are very negative. However will come down. The fact is, there has to be a way to get the dot PERFECTLY programmed on the EA. This means it will go only on the final dot. However i cant think of the way. The EA has only the problem of going very negative before positive. This can hurt if small account users use it. I thought about hedging but its not exactly my choice of trading so i avoid it. The MA cross is too late.. The Dot is too early.. What can be used in between?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Takisd, Your remarks are correct. I've tried several back scan scenarios to determine entry point. The v1.0e EA confirms that the previous bar (1 bar back) has changed signal from 2 Bars back. I tried v1.0f havings 2 bars back with same new trade signal and another EA with 3 bars back having same new trade signal. Everything I tried placed orders. Just that the 2 bars back placed fewer orders than 1 bar back and 3 bars back less than 2 bars back. In backtest the current v1.0e (1 bar back) out performed both 2 bars and 3 bars. It appeared that waiting for 2 bars or 3 bars with same signal, in many cases, got into the trade too late. This week so far has been very slow due very slow trending pairs. On 2 demos, no orders have closed. I believe tlatomi method prefers moderate trending pairs. One demo is v1.0f trading dot to dot. The other is a new v2 that trades dot to dot plus 2nd order on MA cross (this was an idea from lietuve). As I have said several times in this thread, I have doubts that a tlatomi method EA will ever be as good as the manual trading. Although, I do believe it is good enough to make profits automatically. Time will tell. Wackena

--- 帖子 #442 ---
You have done a good job. The E version of the EA works.. The problem is you have to have margin. Which means the profit size has to be small in order to maintain safety. Have you taken a look at a MACD option as confirmation? New bar shorter than old + dot = signal etc. I havent actually gotten into helping fix it, and I am sorry. But i have been really busy. MACD should pretty much do it if you can program it to look for 2 signals. Always MA crosses are LATE.. Scrap that option. It works only 60% of the time and isnt as profitable. The dots usually happen on the end of a rally. Which is good because you will almost guarentee a profit. Just the profit is smaller than it could be. This is where MACD could come in. But again MACD can be delayed so you can miss signals. The volume could be put into it also. However volume indicators on MT4 brokers are usually so fake there is no point.. There has to be something though.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
At about 8:00 o'clock (CET) this morning the red dot appeared both on EURUSD and GBPUSD charts and the EA closed the two sell orders with USD 21.00 and USD 17.00 profit respectively. In one minute the EA opened one EURUSD buy and one GBPUSD buy orders both are floating now in negative - please see the statement attached. Both the pairs have been falling for a while - please see the images attached. Both the trades could turn out in profit later - I have no doubt, but in short term the sell orders would have remained till the trend change. So, I think in this particular case SilverTrend signals were a bit early.

Great-Thanks for a look at your chart. I've just plotted your indicators for the tlatomi method-need to review the Vegas method as well Cheers~ ?- do you have to refresh the Silvertrand indicator or is it just me/

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi summitfx, Long jpy @ 116.04 - is that your first trade with this method ? Yes, you have to refresh the silvertrend indicator but with a 4 H Timeframe, you do that only when you see a ma cross coming. Bye

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Stop @ 116.50 now

Judex; Nice trading- You pretty much nailed that 1st target-Very Impressive Yes, Just started experimenting with the method.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Is there an EA for this method?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi raffaelst, Read the lasts 10 pages of the thread - there is a discussion about an ea developped by Wackena. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Well, after a day these two orders are floating in negative on my demo as follows: EURUSD --&gt; -60 GBPUSD --&gt; -235 I think utilising the confimation by the MA cross would have been helpful this time (at least for short time).

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Could you post the the complete file for these three indicators for MT4 please. I have been to download and compile them but they do not appear in the custom indicators, only the SHI_Silver shows in the list. Should I save the files to Indicators directory? Thanks

--- 帖子 #460 ---
hello, is there any other indicator that works well with this method, i tried using this with stoch..and the result is much better...almost zero false signal. i've been working alot with this technique and teach some to my fellow friends who have difficulty is understanding the forex term and lingo...especially the english word...while doing that i experiment this method with alot of indicator some are custom made from other developer and some are from meta itself... yet no other indicator can beat the stoch...what do you all think...its simple and easy to understand....

My second lot of USD/JPY was closed @ 116.73 (P/L : +64 PIPS) Howard : Hi, Unzip the files and put them into your experts/indicators/ directory. That should fix your problem. Hope this helps. Abid : I'm going to take a look at the stoch indicator with this method - thanks.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi Judex I do not know what the problem is, the file goes straight to Meta Editor, I can compile it without any errors, but it does not give me the option to unzip it, however it does not appear in the list of custom indicators. Howard

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hello Abid, Could you post your setup details and picture ?

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Howard, I don t know either what the problem is. Here you can download the sniper indicator and the shi silver trend Here the last one Try to download them directly (save link as) and then put them directy without compling in the experts/indicators directory.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hi Judex! This method looks promising on the 4H Chart. I have 3 questions: 1) Do you wait until the bar is finished to enter a trade? 2) Which currency pairs are you trading? 3) How do you handle news? Many thanks Parabolic

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Thank you Judex I have all of them now. The only difference is that the NonLag is yellow all the way as opposed to be in 3 colours. Should we get the arrows on the chart as seen in your chart image? I do not have any arrows either Howard

--- 帖子 #467 ---
http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/3636/36qt0.jpg by adding more value such as the stoch indicator into the trading system, the green pips is almost certain...sumtime when i see the signal and execute a position, i already smilling for victory..that how sure i am about using tlatomi with stoch...hope someone may have a feedback on that...if you notice that the stoch is not a lagging indicator...so we could save time and make more pips confidently..

--- 帖子 #468 ---
helo judex, do you think that the sniper is quite deceiving in term of giving the signal..from observation the sniper indicator is very sensitive toward the market changes and causing me alot of doubt to enter a trade...do you have a better tweak or setting for this particular indicator. just my 0.02..

Live Trades and Stops Hi. Are these live trade results? Also the losses are very small and impressive. Where do you determine your stops? If you put them below the last lowest or highest candle (depending on whether you are going long or short) the loss would be more significant. If you are just entering on the red or blue dot then it seems the stop could be set tighter. If you are waiting for all three indicators then it seems the stop would be have to be set deeper. Stop suggestions please? Thank you, Michel

--- 帖子 #470 ---
as for me, i have two way for exit... a) look at the previous minor/major high/low b) look at the pivot Support and resistence area as the target profit or exit.. p/s im not good with the exit strategy...lol..

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hi Parabolic, 1) Yes, i wait until the bar is finished to enter a trade. 2) Right now, i'm trading EUR/USD - GBP/USD - GBP/JPY - USD/JPY - USD-CHF 3) I don't trade during big news (the red ones on the calendar) - and avoid the market if i don't see a trend (to determine if there's a trend or not, i use an indicator called alligator) Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hi howard, I don't use anymore the NonLag indicator for this method but if you still want to use it, the right parameters are available on the first pages of this thread - i replace it with the Ma cross (the arrows come from the ma cross indicator).

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi Abid, Personaly, i'm quite happy with the sniper in 4H but that's only me. My parameters for the sniper are : pq : 4 pr: 8 ps: 5 trigger : 4 Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Judex, What setting do you use for the alligator?

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hi Michel, To answer your questions : 1) Yes - these are live trade results. 2) To determine my stops, i'm very visual. As you can see on the chart below : for this trade, i choose to put my stop just below the lowest bar at 115.56 because it was the lowest nearest bar but also because one of the vegas lines was almost at the same level. I'm always waiting for the three signal - in general but it's not a rule : my stop will be between 40 pips and 80 pips http://tlatomi.com/blog/images/ff/graphusdjpy50906.gif

If I am understanding this right the GBP/USD is giving us a signal right now. The only thing we would be waiting for is the non lag to give us a yellow line based on the closing of the next candle. The FX sniper is just barely crossing up but because volatility is low this would be expected. AM I understanding this right?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
We have the dot, the sniper cross - now we are waiting for the cross of the two Ma. I don't use the Nonlag anymore. http://www.tlatomi.com/blog/images/ff/cross.gif

--- 帖子 #479 ---
What MA's are you using? and are they exponential? THanks

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Red MA : 9 Simple - close Orange MA : 5 Expo - close

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Judex Can you direct me to link to download the fib-vegas lines on your chart below. They appear to be excellent predicators of price movement thanks

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Here you can find Vegas Method, Fibs, and how to use them. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...splay.php?f=70

--- 帖子 #483 ---
It looks like the Swissy is primed for a short except for that sneaky silversignal that surfaced below

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Even though the FX Sniper is giving a great signal to the downside the Silver Signal would keep you from taking the trade. Correct? Also we don't have a great cross on the MA's yet. Could just be a bounce off the 9 MA at this point. This is the first day I have looked at this so I am filled with questions. Sorry in advance.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I'm learning this method too but I think you are right. Most likely the CHF will drop down to 1.23 area during the London session but that's just a guess and I'm not taking the trade. Where is JudeX when we need him?? Is this THE Original FXSniper's blog/ = http://fxsniper.blogspot.com/

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Here is another example of the SilverSig getting in the way of a good trade? Right? The Eur/Usd

--- 帖子 #487 ---
hello guy, just wanna share my thought.... if only someone can develop vegas dot instead of using vegas line, i prefer my chart to be clean from many lines.....its gud to have vegas for exit strategy..but hate to have messy chart.... just my 0.02

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hello, I am looking for a new broker and I am considering GFT. I would love to try the platform over the next month or so if you can help. Thanks

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi, If you see your chart today, are you still sure that it was a good trade and that the silver sig was getting in the way ? I have to go to class... Bye

--- 帖子 #490 ---
LOL~~

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hi everybody Did we have a chart for these modifications, or any download file. Well done all.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Did you use it on 4h gold? Thanks

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hi Judex On what time frame did you place the said trades, 4h? Thanks

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I noticed that the silver trend signal under the under the candle at 1.8785 on teh GBP/USD disappeared. Is this perhaps the reason that all the signals historically look so good? After the price went up and then came back down the signal went away. Do the signals disappear when the price moves significantly below the signal. Just trying to observe it effectiveness. Thank you for all your comments.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Yes, the dots repaint, That is why we should wait for the other 2 signals after the dot to enter the trade

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Just looking for your thoughts....... It is noon Pacific Coast Time (US) and all the signals look in line for a short on EUR/GBP. On the 4hour chart.... Red Dot 5/9 cross Sniper cross. Same singals are confirming this on the 1hr chart. Any one have any other thoughts? Thanks

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Has anyone tried trading just the dots for smaller gains then adding to their position when and if we get the other two conformation signals? Just thinking out loud here.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I am seeing the same thing on the EUR/GPB. I haven't traded this live yet but from the little I know the signals look promising. For you who have traded this method is this the setup we are looking for? Would be set a stop above the previous candles wick? Has anyone traded this pair using this method? Questions, questions, questions.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Looking again at the chart this pair has formed a triple bottom which could be a concern for entering short.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Would anyone be interested in a text messaging service each time a signal is confirmed based on the accepted Tlamoi method. I would be interested in receiving, and/or organizing and staffing etc.. Drop me an email if interested

--- 帖子 #501 ---
tried but not that good enough. what was wrong?? gave a buy signal. dot, cross and sniper cross

--- 帖子 #502 ---
you get that thursday? with jpy? i have get the same problem, jpy get a big move because of german's news. i didn't know yet when it happen yesterday....

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I'm seeing my 1st real setup on the usd/jpy now. Is seems over extended to me. Any of you Tlatomi's taking it?

--- 帖子 #504 ---

Hi, By tradition, i don't use to trade on friday because i find the day too short. In this trade, all the signals are here but i don't like : 1) the fact that the fxsniper is in range between 200 and -200 (too many false signals at this level) 2) the old resistance (R on the chart) 3) the price is already above the 2 vegas MA Anyway, it could be a good trade but for all this reasons i wouldn't take it. Hope this helps. http://picnac.com/images/5720usdjpy.gif

--- 帖子 #508 ---
we are moving forward with it. i've had a good response. i want to txt out this method and the bagovino method. thanks for the analysis on the jpy setup- makes sense to me. link to your blog? i admire your skills. i only speak texan

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi, Right now, the trade is a winner - let's see what's happen later. You can find a link to my blog in my profile - don't want to post it directly - don't know if it's allowed Bye

Hi Judex, how do you use the alligator indicator to prevent a possible bad trade? Many thanks, Parabolic

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Zolero over at the MQL / forum was kind enough to advise how to change SH_SilverTrendSig to auto redraw dot to keep chart current. This eliminates the need to reset chart to see current dot. Also, I changed the dot to an up or down arrow. Wackena

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi, With the alligator, i wait for a sideways market (blue zones on the chart). When i identify a sideway period, i wait for a tlatomi signal in the opposite direction of the previous trend. Just a smal correction: I was reading my previous post and it should say ''if i don't see a potential trend''. http://picnac.com/images/4193alliagtor.gif

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Thanks to Zolero and you !! that's great !

--- 帖子 #515 ---
having downloaded the zip indicator file -WhAT do I open the files in/with? Simply clicking on them does not open them. Sorry fr such a basic question but I am not a computer expert yet:-)

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hi, You need to put the indicators files into your Metatrader/experts/indicators/ directory.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Judex Thanks for a prompt reply.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Judex, My alligator in the MT4 that I downloaded has Parameters called: Jaws Period Teeth Period Lips Period It is also a different version I think than yours, not only because of the language but because of the Parameter page looks different. I sorry I do not understand what appears to me as Spanish. Is the translation the same? Does "machoires" mean Jaws? Does "dents" mean Teeth. (It must mean teeth because in English I go to the Dentist to have my teeth clean ). Could you try to explain from your post #513 how the alligator identifies a sideways market? (Ex. - You see the blue line cross but not the red line.) Thanks

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Wackena, I'm sorry for being picky here, but I like the Dot. I would like to use the newest version of the SH_SilverTrendSig but I already have arrows on my chart showing the 5/9 cross, thanks to OrangeRoshan, post #158. Could you upload a file or show how to put the dot back in MetaEditor. I have gone to the web site that is shown in the SH_SilverTrendSig. It looks like Russian. Do you by any chance know how this indicator works? What is it? Thanks you all your help.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
The symbol that is drawn by an indicator is controlled by SetIndexArrow syntax of and indicator. SetIndexArrow(0,233); SetIndexArrow(1,234); These numbers are the Ascii Codes of 233/2344 in the WingDings font and it prints that font character on your chart. To return to the small dot, change both values back to 159. If you want to try some other fun symbols change to 108 (Bigger dot) 40 58 71/72 171 175 You will need to recompile the indicator, and it will become effective immediatly.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
To Chart11610, Thanks for you help. That was easy. Do you have any idea what this indicator does to calculate the dot?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Since all of the comments to support this indicator are originally in Russian, and I do not speak Russian, nor have that font loaded, I can only speculate on what it is doing. I kind of take the approach, if it works, don't break it.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Long signal on the EUR/JPY Right? Someone send me a txtmsg so I can look it over next time?/

--- 帖子 #524 ---
tortoise, attached is modified indicator with dots. I think Russian too. It seems the indicator scans back 9 bars finding the high &amp; low for each bar. When it calculates that the current bar has changed from increasing highs to decreasing lows, it paints a blue dot/down arrow and vice versa for red dot/up arrow. As with most trend indicators, it can have many false signals before the trend truely changes. Wackena.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi judex001, I just started using your tool today but my charts don't look the same as your latest ones. I downloaded the latest files from your blog and compiled them but my charts still look very similar to your initial release of these files. I also don't have any arrows and I only have one moving average instead of 2. Am I missing something in my configuration? Thanks, Andrew

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi Andrew, I put the last indicators i use in the zip files and you can find all the parameters for each indicator in the pdf. Let me know if you still having problems.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I see that the AUDUSD may have some promise for a trend reversal. Things are in transition, but here are the signals: 1. Sniper crossed up from below -200. 2. Silver gave a blue dot. 3. 5,9 had crossed up, but now is back down. (so, just have to wait for the 5,9 to cross up again). I missed the first time that the 5,9 crossed, but on the next cross, I think it might be a good entry. I also know that there is a red silvertrend dot, but that will disappear if the trend goes to the up side. Does anyone have any thoughts? (Even Abid's Stochs are showing crossed up from OS).

--- 帖子 #528 ---
why no one is mentioning the USDJPY sell ready to trigger

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Really? Not me- Not any time soon! Sometimes logic is the best Indicator

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi, I only see one signal for the USD/JPY. http://picnac.com/images/8835usdjpy.gif

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi Longtang, It’s probably best to wait a little longer : -The Fx sniper seems to want to cross down again -Alligator is going down again after a little hesitation That's only my way to see that trade - i may be wrong but I prefer to stay out of a good trade than entering a bad one. http://picnac.com/images/7650audusd.gif

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hi everyone, Maybe un nice signal on eurjpy. Let's see what happen in 1h 15 minutes. For now : Potential stop @ 149.80 Potential tp @ 147.73 http://picnac.com/images/8719eurjpy.gif

--- 帖子 #533 ---
So far this method has been perfect on 4h charts. This is real trades not demo.So far 7 out 7. 0 for 1 on hour chart. I will never trade this method on any other time frame than 4 hour again. It's the best system I have ever seen. I am the reason why I am not up over 300 pips this week. I have been exiting my trades almost as soon as it goes my direction. When you feel like everytime you open a postion it seems to reverse on you, it makes you think" get out before it turns". So I set some rules for myself to avoid this. I set my stop 35-40 pips away unless there is a major support or resistance level closer. I am using fib lines and support/resistance lines to tp. Thanks for sharing your method. May God bless you.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Sorry, I'm a newbie, please kindly guide me on this method! 5 is 5 Exponential Moving Average and 9 is 9 Simple Moving Average, isn't it? I carefully read your words : 3) Switch around 1hr, 30mins charts to see when the dot is already there. Dont want to see it do any David Cooperfield stuff! what happen if on 4H the last dot is red, but when I turn back to 30M teh last dot is blue, and on 1H the last dot is blue...like happened now on my GBP/USD Chart (05:03 am GMT). 1) 1 bar after the opposite dot appear (look at the slope/angle of the 5/9 to confirm trend change); or if there is a degree for the angle...what is it? Please kindly advis on this! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hi Judex! In your Tlatlomi Method document you state the values 1-4 for the Risk Model of the Vegas indicator. Which specific values do you use for the different currency pairs? Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Check out the Mouteki thread also. I find it a great compliment to the 4hr tlatomi chart. The added value is a projection of the profit target. I am getting signal at the same time between the 2 for entry points.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi jj7000, Thank you very much for the feedback ! Hope you make a lot of pips with this methods and others.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Thanks JudeX BTW - Does anyone have any details instructions about how they best use this tool? If people could share how they use it successfully, what moving averages they use, what do they look for, etc. That would be very helpful. Thanks again, Andrew

--- 帖子 #541 ---
jj7000 I'm glad to see this is working for you. Are you looking at the position of the Sniper when it crosses? What threshold are you using? Can you post the time and dates on which pairs you have been sucessful with? I think it will be very helpful to everyone to see exactally what you're doing. Thanks! mrLogik

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Awesome Post, Judex!. Thanks Judex for showing us how you use the Alligator! It is a good call to wait for it to develop. Excellent. Over the last 24 hours, there has been more development. I loved your adage of "I'd rather miss a profitable trade than to get into a bad one." Here is a picture of what I am seeing as of now: Here is the AUDUSD 4H as of right now: The alligator is starting to close its Jaws. The 4H Tlatomi indicators are as such: 1. Blue dot at the 0.7482 bar. 2. 5, 9 crossed up. 3. Sniper crossed up just above -200. Any thoughts would be appreciated, since it would further our learning with real time examples. Thank you in advance. longtang P.S: My settings for Alligator are just like the ones you used: 7, shift 5 5, shift 3 3, shift 2 Smoothed, close. [Two charts attached below.]

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I have been successful using this method on Eur/Usd, USD/CHF, GBP/JPY, USD,JPY. I believe it can work on any pair though. I wait for hours for the trade to develop even if I have to stay up to 3a.m-4:00a.m in the morning.I live in U.S central time zone. I stick with the original method. I have implemented the 5ema and 9sma but, I still use non lag ma. I wait for it to turn yellow. The reason why I use it because sometimes the 5/9 is right on top of each other and I feel there is not enough separation between the two to make the best decision. I miss some pips by doing this but I have not failed once. I have noticed when the nonlag turns yellow a move of at least 10 pips or more happens almost instantaneously. I notice on several threads people start adding so much to a system that its not the same system anymore. I look for 1. dot 2. cci cross 3. 5/9 cross 4. nonlag to turn yellow . Then I get in .

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi All First i want say that english is not my primary language so i am sorry about it. !!!!Judex001 thank you very much for publishing this great method!!! I read whole this thread but i'am confused what is official version of tlatomi method. In your last pdf document is only setting for indicators, but there isnt description for new version of tlatomi (modification based on Tiga Abdul, i mean that you are trading this modification) In pdf "TIGA ABDUL with Tlatomi method.pdf" is only this ENTRY: Secondary Signal a) Dot appear or/and b) CCI cross. Primary signal a) 5/9 cross. EXIT: Secondary Signal a) Opposing DOT appears, or Primary Signal b) When CCI cross (more often) or 5/9 cross Can you tell me what is your exact entry, exit signal and what is sequence for getting indicators signals. I know that for determination TP you are using vegas indicator, on first MA you are close half of lot and on second ma you are close the rest of lot? Do you move TP whenever vegas MA lifting UP or you are set TP i then don't move with it? I need know what is your actual method because i want make EA for this. Maybee i can publish same pdf as for first version of tlatomi there is everything cleary for me. Once again thank you very much and i wish you a lot of pips!!!

Guys, although i´ve been reading this thread and the other one of the tlatomi method, i think this one is getting very big, and some times confusing. I think i will be a good idea to post a new thread starting from all the conclusions we have arrived in this one, so anyone new to it, or the ones we´ve been reading this thread, could start with fresh ideas and information. i´m not creating a new thread since i don´t think i have the authority to do it (since i didn´t startthis one), so if you feel my idea is right, please start a new thread from a fresh start. tnx

--- 帖子 #553 ---
jtacher, yes i agree with you, this thread somehow very confusing...and hard to make as reference especially for newbie....

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Thanks for your response. Very informative. Just a few other questions. 1. When you have the CCI cross, are you at all concerned with where the cross took place in reference to the 0 line? 2. Do you look at any larger time frame to confirm overall trend? I personally use a weighted moving overage (H+L/2) on the same timeframe and look for direction. I've been playing with a length of 5 / 8 / 12, but I'm still unsure which is the safest (best). 3. Using fibs? (Vegas 4H). Thanks again. mrLogik.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Judex, thank you very much and all who help in the tlatomi method. first trade with it last night on the euro gave 30 pips. hi summit, thanks for the link. the indicator that i have a question about is the one thats the red and tan line over your price bars. please and if you have the time what is its name and where do we find it. thanks again, ben

Hi Folks! I went through this whole thread last night - fascinating! I can't wait to test this out. I will trade manually but I am also going to test the EA. I got a bit confused as my brain overloaded from all the great posts. Just a quick question: What is the current status of the created Tlatomi EAs, which one seems to work best and what are the associated indictors required? Are they all posted together somewhere, or can they be? I stumbled upon Forex Factory a couple of weeks ago and I am so glad I did. I can't tell you how many hours I have spent reading the site. Thanks folks and I will continue to follow this thread with great interest. Thanks to all who participate in this and other threads. Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I found this in another forum. It was originally created by Accrete. It works really well with Tlatomi. Put RSI(8) on your chart. Then the 8 period exponential moving average of RSI(8) (just drag the moving average from the navigator into the RSI pane and choose apply to first indicator from the drop down box.). Then follow the same method to put in the 20 period simple moving average of RSI(8). Look for the times when the RSI(8) crosses the 8 period moving average of RSI(8) or just look for the SHI Silvertrends and then look at the RSI. You'll find that if the Silvertrend signal is accurate, that RSI will also cross it's moving average. This happens almost at the same time as the Silvertrend appears. I can see where this could be used as a replacement for the notoriously repainting SHI or as a replacement for the 5-9 cross or a supplement to both. It happens much sooner than the 5-9 and pretty much coincides with the FX Sniper cross. On one particular Tlatomi trade on the EUR 4 hr, it would have gotten in 50 pips sooner than the 5-9 ( the 5-9 trade turned out to be a loser). Best longs are taken from crosses below the 20 period avg and shorts from above. Thought you guys might like to take a look at this.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Ok. I did just what you said: I put up a pane of RSI 8. Then, I used 2 moving averages: 1. 8 EMA of the RSI 2. 20 SMA of the RSI. Here is a picture of the EURJPY: I see the most recent down move had a red silvertrend dot. That dot coincides with the exact crossing of the RSI and its 8 EMA. Am I on the right track? Love to hear more about it.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Thank you, Taxgeek. I use it with Snipers LSMA on H1 chart, but I don't think the way I use it can be called Tlatomi Method anymore.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
You got the idea. I picked up on this because I'm trying to trade the daily charts. I have used Tlatomi on them, but the 5-9 crossover is a bit slow. A lot of the move tends to go by before you get in. I was looking for something that would confirm the SHI and not repaint itself. So that I could basically just use that and the FX Sniper cross in conjunction with the Vegas daily. This looked like just the ticket. I think it would probably help on 4 hour charts too because of the MA lag. I really don't fool with anything less than the 4 hr chart, so I don't know how it would work on shorter time frames. The period might need to be adjusted. This, of course, may not be exactly Tlatomi but it helps it I think. What I'm doing is probably not Tlatomi, because I've added quite a bit to it with things to monitor trend, support and resistance, and volatility to make sure that I trade at the optimum time. My goal is to pick up enough pips on one trade to be happy for a whole month until the next trade comes along. So far it's been successful and should improve with this addition.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I replaced the NonLagMA pretty quickly with the LSMA with an Rperiod of 10. It signals on the daily pretty much in conjunction with the SHI. That was my first effort to eliminate the lag of the 5-9. I've moved beyond Tlatomi too, although it's still the core. I just called attention to the RSI cross, because so many folks seem to have a problem or hangup with the SHI repainting. They can just use the cross to confirm quickly that the SHI signal is valid. If it's not, the RSI won't cross, and the SHI will just disappear on refresh. If the RSI crosses, you can be pretty sure that the MA cross will follow.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hi, Since the thread is starting to be a little complicated for the new readers ''and the old ones'', i'm going to post 2 files : tlatomi.pdf --- a detailed pdf presentation tlatomi.zip ---- all the right indicators for the method In this presentation, you could find the most recents settings. Bye

--- 帖子 #566 ---
to judex001 or anyone else who can help, thanks you judex001 very much for the extremely informative and comprehensive revised compilation of Tlatomi Strategy. It is very much appreciated. one question on the Alligator indicator : on the Alligator, can someone explain what type of " smoothed moving average, close" judex001 intends for us to use for each of the 3 MA lines- I am aware of the shift or displacement also ( no problem there) any explanation on the smoothed part of it would be very helpful. since I use TradeStation instead of Metatrader I have to modify the existing indicators to fit TS. thanks again for all the help traderdp

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Thanks for the update judex001. About the alligator, it´s conformed by 3 SMMA. You can plot the respective MA with your values and voila, you have an alligator.

I dont believe there is an orange bar in the indicator. That was added for you to visually see where a proper entrance would take black based on the confluence of variables (ie alligator, 5/9, CCI, Silver). My thoughts.

Here are some results from my first day of using this system and so far I'm very satisfied made 282 pips in one day . Thank you very much for the guys who have been working hard to create this great method my humbel bows to you.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
@kateeus What TF did you using for this metode. Thx

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Bagox I mostly use the 4h TF but sometimes I check the 1h as well to see if there is a different signal, but so far it has showed the same signals almost everytime. If I see that 1h TF has been showing sell signal for few hours and the 4h TF is still showing buy then I'll usually wait for the candel to close in the 4h chart to see if it starts to show sell as well.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi The targets seem to be very small, on the 4h we are expecting targets of 100 or more, what is the time frame you are using?

Hi all, please can someone help me ? I need signal when EMA1 crosses EMA 144, can I use MA_Crossover_Signal wav, which is used in tlatomi method, but of course I ll change slower and faster ema from 5 and 9 to 1 and 144 ? Will it works ? Thank you all for your advices

Hi I'm using the OrangeRoshans method combined with tlatomi method. The pdf file for this method is in OrangeRoshans post #157 and the indicators I use can be found on the same page in the next post. I use the 4hour TF most of the time. I'm very new to forex only 1 month old so I'm still uncertain with the target points I usually aim for 20-30 pips per trade. Thanks for everybody for being so helpful in here this is the friendliest forum ever.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
what charting software is being used for this method? Thanks

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi guys: i´ve been testing the tlatomi e. ITS SIMPLY GREAT. the settings are default under 4 hr chart. the ea is very profitable, and woks really good. my problem is the HEDGE OPTION. i think the ea will be GREAT, if the hedge option worked as it ment to be. let me explain: everytime i use the hedge option, the ea BLOW THE ACCOUNT IN LESS THAN A HOUR. it start to make buy/sell trades, one after the other, opening and closing the same position. so with the only spread of each action, the account is dead in one hour or less. Is there any chance anyone can fix this? tnx

Hi, Can anybody say what your exit signal if price doesn't reached TakeProfit?

hi. im using the taltomi ea v. 1.0 e. it really NEEDS the hedging function. look at today stament. I also think the ea needs the magic number fuction. thats why i think its not closing this losing trades Also, how does the stop loss worked on this ea? tnx again

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I tested it like I said, on EUR/USD, EUR/JPY and AUD/USD. Very good prediction on EUR/USD even if it's kind of unstable these days. Excellent on EUR/JPY. A little error in prediction for AUD/USD, but it's still going in the right way. I followed the instructions and was ok without loss. I will test it also on USD/CHF, USD/JPY and NZD/USD. Will keep you posted.

After unsuccesful H4 Boogie_tlatomi ver. E testing I started testing on D1 timframe. Pairs USDCHF, USDJPY, EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDCAD. Starting ballance $3000. Settings - default. So far looks good.

Hi folks I've been reading this thread over the weekend and this method seems like a very effective strategy. I may have missed out the posts addressing this issue (there are so many posts here!), but what's really the best exit strategy? Exiting when the opposite dot appears (as per the original method) would mean we miss out on big parts of some very large moves. What I've been thinking about is utilising yet another indicator; TrendManager. I've thought about opening 3 positions on signal. Closing the first one when the opposite dot appears, closing the second one when the opposite entry signal appears (dot, CCI cross, MA arrow), and keeping the third one open until the TrendManager turns in the opposite direction. Also, the NonLag indicator seemed to (at least in hindsight) fairly effectively eliminate whipsaw in ranging market conditions. The rule (initially posted) to never open a position unless the NonLag signal occurs AFTER the CCI cross basically did just that. I'm not sure if the MA cross arrows do as good a job. (note that I can't say this with too much confidence as NonLag is difficult to consider when back-testing a method because I think it actually repaints itself and changes color retrospectively!) Any thoughts? HT LT

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hello, I read your indicator very carefully. but i don't understand it works on what method. If you explain it, I am waiting for your reply. Thanks

--- 帖子 #615 ---
What I don't understand is how TIGA enhances Tlatomi. When I read through the PDF's on this thread they use the following indicators: TLATOMI uses: 5 EMA 9 SMA FX_Spier's_ERgodic_CCI_Trigger SHI_SilverTrendSig-3 ....and others TIGA ABDUL with TLATOMI uses: 5 EMA 9 SMA FX_Spier's_ERgodic_CCI_Trigger SHI_SilverTrendSig-3 In other words, they use the same indicators and trade setup (the TLATOMI method actually uses more indicators). So what's the difference ??

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Tortoise, thank you for this concise summary. I am wondering if I can get help on stop loss and profit target settings. I have read every post up until here, and I understand the recommendation of 10-15 pips for target for newbies (which I am), but am having trouble figuring out a good stop loss setting. Also, if we only use 10-15 pip targets, there hardly seems to be even 1 trade per day, even taking into account the 3 markets traded. Is this right? Thank you all for your help to us newbies.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Abid, can you give us your stop loss and target methods with these 44 winning trades? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Kteeus, this is very good. Would you mind explaining your stop loss and take profit strategies for these trades? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
This is what I found could be a good target on the GBP. 80 pips made the most money. 10 pips gave 100% profits. The more pips you try to get the lower the % of profitable trades. I only tested the GBP. Now need to trade any other pair. Another good method that seems to be working lately is get out on the next signal. This produces an average lost of 37 pips and profits are good. I also use other technical helps to determine when to get out. The current trade in the GBP has just come off of a nice Fib .618 retracement. This puts a target at least making new lows at 9/29 and more likely an equal swing down from 1.8897 that we had from 9/25 1.9073 to 9/29 at 1.8632. This current trade in GBP I am going with a 5/9 cross as an exit.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
The way I understood this the TIGA ABDUL was using MA crosses to trade. The Tlatomi originally had a non-lag MA. This was replaced by TIGA ABDUL's 5/9 ma. That is how the two methods have merged.

Wingdings are actually a font similar to Ariel or Time New Roman. You can go into Word, and change the font to Wingdings if you want. There is also a table of the different symbols on the MQL4.COM web site.

I think I know what you are talking about. The bank traders go for consistent high percentage pips rather than a lot of pips. I have a question: what are the lot sizes that they trade with in those type of trades. I am sure it is high but how high? Is it something around $100.00 a pip.. or maybe more?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Just a small update on this method: it's very efficient on Daily charts Almost on all pairs. If you don't throw yourself into many trades you can earn pretty much with 3-4 pairs in 1 week.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Bogdan, thank you for your input here. Can you please explain how you are using this method with the daily charts? How do you enter/exit? What are your stop losses? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
The signal in daily are quite good, but the stop?? should be big for internal move.... maybe check for confirmation in faster TF?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I'm just a newbies and i've just been introduced to tlatomi-tiga recently and i think it's very profitable for those who are pro and used to it. I'm still confuse in making decision : whether go LONG or go SHORT. Here are my questions : 1. Do we always have to let the "DOT", "CCI cross", and "5&amp;9 MA crossover" appear prior of placing trade? Sometimes i notice that one of them does not appear. 2. Which one is the best time frame : 4HR or D1? Thats all for this time.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hi, I am fallowing the tlatomi method for 1-1,5 month and it's really wonderfull method. i have planing to use it in live acc. but i have a problem. when i see dot, then croos of cci then ma cross alert and when nonlog turns yellow, i'm waiting for bar close, but when bar closed, the opposite dot appears. and i cannot decide to trade. also, i can't exit immediately because the dot repaints! what should i do? Anybody help me...

--- 帖子 #628 ---
My results with the TIGA ABDUL with TLATOMI have been very good. The consensus seems to be that the 4 hour chart is a lot safer to use than the 30 minute chart.I take entries off both time frames.On October 23, I made 118 pips on the 30minute chart on GBPUSD. OrangeRoshan - thanks for the information.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Tlatomi is a bit slow for the daily chart. You would do well to use it on the 4hr time frame. I tried it on the daily, because I like Tlatomi, and daily is the only time frame that I can profitably trade. I still use the silvertrend dot, but the 5-9 cross and the ergodic CCI are gone and replaced. What I use can't really be called Tlatomi anymore, but it is fast enough to work on the daily chart. As a trader the first thing you need to home in on is the time frame that you can best trade on, and then find or develop a method that will work for that time frame. It took me a while to figure that out, because I've never really heard anyone say that. Hopefully this will prove helpful to you. Figuring that out is why I now trade live , and why I picked up 150 pips today. If you don't settle on the time frame that is right for you, the whole process will take longer as you hop between time frames and methods. I'm not being critical, just trying to offer some useful advice. The dot is an early warning device. Trade based on the 5-9 and the CCI cross, but don't trade unless you have both of those dot or no dot.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
just to add my five cents worth...and to help the new people to tlatomi....I have been trading for around five years and i have been using tlatomi for about 2 months on my live account... I only use the 4hour time frame. and i only open a trade on a arrow and after I have confirmed the trade with my other indicators. But I have found the tlatomi method to be very succesfull... As far as exit is concerened I always set my exits on the pivots if the trade breakes through i move to the next pivot and so on. I hope this is of some help..

--- 帖子 #631 ---
If you don't mind me asking what did you replace the 5-9 and cci with?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Respecting the rules from the pdf file. Also never places a trade in daily chart if FX Sniper don't cross and separate a little. And the NonLagMa should be present. I also know there is a strong signal by adding a RSI 21 with 50 level - line must go above (for long) or under the line (for short). If RSI stays on the 50 level I don't place a trade because it's unstable and I look after 4-6 hours to see if there is time to get a good signal. All the best.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Initially with the Fozzy cross. Now I use the Triple Hull RSI (8), which is a bit faster than Fozzy and has the cross built in using Hull MAs. I have the indicator posted in the My Favorite Indicator thread. Just watch for the SHI and wait for the RSI to cross and go, preferably with the major trend,unless the Bollinger bands indicate congestion or you're right against strong resistance or support (such trades don't get far.) The moving average cross and even the nonlag had me trading right into reversals on the daily chart with little to no profit, which is always the problem with moving averages - you miss half the trend. The Triple Hull RSI crosses almost as soon as the SHI dot appears, so I get most of the trend. This is a big modification of Tlatomi, but it does work beautifully, if you need to be on the daily chart (most people trading the Forex need to be on it). It also cuts out the little short choppy trades generated by just using the RSI - MA cross by itself like Fozzy. It's not quite Tlatomi and not quite Fozzy and probably doesn't belong in a discussion of either. So I'll leave it at that. Judex's system provided me my first real anchor in Forex, and I don't want to hijack his thread. I use it live and make money. So it does work. After I test it live for a few more months, I'll come back and post my own thread.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Yes, the rules for the Tlatomi Method in the first post mentions 4 hr time frame only so I will use the Bagovino Method on the 1 hour chart and the Tlatomi on the 4hour chart.

hi folks i have finished reading this thread and think its a good method i have 2 questions is my entry correct on the chart? 1. the cci cross 2. the dot 3. the cross if its corect why did the alert not appear on the chart for the ema cross? or does it appear on the next candle? for me its now a clear cross my other question is about the ea, i have made backtest on fxdd of the 1.0e version and it always only opened positions in the other direction, for example there was a buy signal and it opened a sell and for a sell signal it opened a buy. is it just on my side this bug ? i will start now forward testing this version and i will see if there will be this bug.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
You should wait for the arrow to appear, then enter. The MA is predicated on the Don of the period. So you wait for the period to end then enter after the arrow appears.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Exactly the same happened to me on my forward testing. I tried to tweak it using different settings but it did not provide the expected results, so I finished to test this EA without success. Perhaps you could ask an experienced programmer to look into the code and improve it.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
In attached file you can find my backtesting result of original tlatomi strategy.. the file is not done yet, I have to do September and October... I did backtesting on entering the trade by original tlatomi setup and entering only on nonlag indicator... The conclusion, for now, is: if u enter on proper tlatomi signal you can achieve 10 pips for sure (100% for now)... excellent for beginners! if u enter ONLY on yellow (nonlag) line, you can get much more pips overall, with TP 10 pips, if u can stop the eventual lost trade within 60-70 pips... ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION: Did anyone solve invisibility of the dot? For example, if u have opened platform and the dot is on the previous bar, the curent bar is then closed and the dot remain on the previous bar... but, if u change chart to 1h and back to 4h, the dot moves from previous to closed one... and it can skip crossing signal, so you cannot be sure is it a good signal... BUT, if you do not change from 4h (or any other time) to 1h and vice versa,or shut down a platform, you have a good signal without knowing that the dot has moved but you do not see it....

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I have found answer to my question....

Could I have link to latest Tlatomi EA ? May be I can take a look at it to find out what's problem thx

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hi ferovca Interesting about the "guarenteed" 10 pips on a tlatomi signal. What is the avg. drawdown/risk before you see the 10 pips gain? My question is that it is pointless waiting for 10 "guarenteed" points if you have to ride out a drawdown of eg. 50 points first. Cheers, JC

--- 帖子 #649 ---
hi skyline it would be great if you could have a look in the code and find where the problem is. thx this are the last 2 versions http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&amp;postcount=418

Ok well i will try but i'm not sure to be able to fix it I have to understand how EA is working before to find error Is it supposed that v1.0e follow TigaAbdul-Tlatomi modification rules made by OrangeRoshan ?

--- 帖子 #651 ---
You have to do it like a machine.... My friend and I trade together, he is a machine, EA for this strategy, I just do research .... So, he enters a trade, put TP 10 pips and SL 100 pips and enjoy adrenaline rush... In the meantime , I read forexfactory forum, learn and so on... after a trade is done, he calls me and tells me what the score is... We catch only 10 pips because it is reliable and margin we are using gives enough profit for us ( we have big account ). Keep it simple...

--- 帖子 #652 ---
What are those ? scripts or indicators ?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Skyline, Yes, you are right, it was a Tlatomi system modified by TigaAbdul, with a 5 EMA and 9 SMA. Attached you can find some screenshots (the colour HMA does not belong to the EA or the system ) and a template that lists the indicators.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Ouch... One bad trade will eliminate 10 good trades. Think about it.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
have been using this method for last 2 months. some signals come delayed, yet profiatble. there seems to be a lot of confusion amongst traders here. the best solution to discuss this method well is for people to post charts which show possible entry signals here and then we can agree/disagree on it. cmon, traders trding on 4 hr charts--there is a lotta time to discuus a potential trade as entry is usually on the opening of the next candle. wait for the new week to see any potential trade setups !!

Hi from dedly in Perth Western Australia. I am a very new member of the forum, &amp; very new to forex trading! An aquaintance who has been very helpful to me advised me of this forum. I do NOT know if I'm allowed to ask questions, BUT he advised I look at the Bagovino &amp; Tlatomi methods. I have a dummy account with an Australian stockbroker. Would someone please be kind enough to explain where I can get required indicators for these methods? Also where I can get the information regarding these 2 methods. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Regards Dedly

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi Dedly, The Tlatlomi pdf file and indicator zip file are in the first post on page 1 of this tlatomi thread.The Bagovino Method is at the start of the Bagovino thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...light=Bagovino Good trading, Flyer373

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Check the file... so far not a single bad trade with proper tlatomi signal... and nobody stops you to take more than 10 pips ( for example, 80% close at 10 pips, 20% let running), so in overall, 1 bad trade doesnt take 10 trades but less.... Other thing is, next signal is generated (crossing) before the stop loss is triggered, so , at the end, you do not have 100 pips loss, but less... If there is a crossing, and you didnt achieve 10 pips, you must close position at crossing price... (beware of big news...) And think about this: if the price goes in loss direction before achieving 10 pips, you can open another positions at -10, -20... from the opening price which signal pointed at and close all positions at +10 pips. This method gives you more profit and less loss... Cheers...

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I would recommend going through this thread. There are a number of atttached PDF's and indicators for this method. Around 01-15 2006 the latest verson of the 'method' is documented in an excellent PDF.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Terrific job compiling stats, 2 questions. Were the trades Cabel? Did the Alligator get used as a filter? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I use original tlatomi method, see post #1.. The pair is cable, 4H... I do not use any other indicators besides the three original ones (I didnt notice any significant improvement using other indicators proposed in this thread and also, I am pleased with 10 pips profit). Why change something that works!? Now, if you want safer trades, get in with proper signal (the dot, crossing, yellow line...simple). 10 pips is guaranteed for now.... If you want more profit ( not by catching more pips, simply because there are more trades available by yellow line) , get in only by yellow line signal... I am testing some nexit strategies, so when I will have something good, I will post it...it takes some time. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #662 ---
ferovca, ok, then your MM is more sophisticated than I thought at first, thnx for explaining. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Thanks, In my case I'm going for more pips, THe alligator seems to be a good filter to avoid whip saws when going for more pips, perhaps when the alligator isn't giving a buy signal, I can ebter for 10 pips!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hello njfx, can you explain the alligator filter, I searched through the entire thread and I cant find it. Thanks

Hi, Where can i save those indicator to? I am using Meta Trader 4. Pls kindly advice.

In the folder where you installed Metatrader, you will copy the indicators into the folder \experts\indicators

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi, The indicator in \experts\indicators are all in *.ex4 format while the the 4 indicator from The tlatomi method are using *.mq4 format. How can i make it work?

Just put it into the folder, restart the program and you can find it in the folder 'custom' when you want to add an indicator.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hi, Since there is still some people interested in my method on FF, i'm going to post a update i'm working on. 2 weeks ago, I began the second phase of testing : forward testing so i'm not sure yet if this update is profitable or not. UPDATE : 1 - Replace the jaws of the alligator by 5/13/62 EMAs. 2 - Identify the trend (cross of the EMAs) 3 - The distance between the 62EMA and the price of entry must be at least 20 pips. EXAMPLE : http://picnac.com/images/6915FFGBPUSD1.gif 1 - EMAs cross === Trend is up now. http://picnac.com/images/8150FFGBPUSD.gif We are working on the last signal fot this example. 1- Trend is up so we only place Long positions 2- Blue Dot appears 3- CCI cross 4- Blue Arrow appears 5- Price of entry is 1.2721 and 62EMA is at 1.2698 (1.2721-1.2698=23 pips) Using the 5/16/62 EMAs instead of the alligator, we miss less opportunities and we have a lot more points of entry or re-entry. What's your opinon on this ? Good trades !

--- 帖子 #673 ---
So far, which do you find works better, the move "through" the 62 EMA, or the "bounce" away from it? System looks interesting to me.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Here you are.... BTW, judex001, wrong title on your recent chart (second one... ) PS: I am attaching the picture for the first time so....

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Have you found this as efficent as suing the alligator for avoiding whipsaws? Are you using the 5/13 in leiu of the 5/9 ma? Is the theory it will allow for an earlier entry? Are you still using the Vegas Fob lines to define price targets? What are you looking at for exit signals?

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Judex, So, its no longer ema 5 &amp; sma 9 ? 5,13&amp;62 ema is using Rob Booker's settings?

--- 帖子 #677 ---
What are the settings you are refering to for the 5.13.62 EMA's ?

--- 帖子 #678 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=9587

--- 帖子 #679 ---
thats right-- there is a 5/13/62 ema strategy Rob Booker talks about i personally use 62 ema in numerous time frames the idea that the entry has to be more then 20 pips away from 62ema--i dont support-- ithas no validation, but yes u will see conoldiation + support/resistence in diff time frames around 62 ema. i agree that these 3 emas can be used instead of alligator as we generally confriming 2 things--cross of ema's and trend.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
I would use higher time frames to determine trend. If you use 5/13 cross on 4H to determine trend then you have negated the 9/5. 9/5 works well. Don't get away from this. I also like Vegas Daily to determine when to trade. Look at his method on daily. You go short at higher Fib averages above tunnels and long at lower below tunnels.

Exellent method. Best seen on 4-hours chart. What is the exit strategy anyway? The trading rules are a dot signal, then cross. and that looks like a filter to many whipsaws. But how to caculate profit, stoploss, exit time? Anybody share.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
nolagma_v5 is very good. if you long and nolagma_v5 turns tomato, its a good exit signal. set filter to 20. last trade is 400+ pips.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Thank you. I do not know why I see this or what is the logic behind that following thing; when a dot appears there is always a candle in the same direction after it even on daily and weekly. what is the deal? I do not talk about the signal but when a blue dot appears always there is a bearish weekly candle. open and see. Any explaination? Cause that itself, would be a signal.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Look at the picture, what I am missing really? Someone might explain it to me. Regardless of a good, fake signal. seems that next bars agree always. And if I count on this, EURUSD is near a top and a reversal candle????

--- 帖子 #685 ---
ahmed, the dot indicator repaints the past, dont relay on this indicator exclusively.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
This method is excellent as indicators helps to signal a trade. My son, is now using it and make pips most of the time. He like to impress his GF while watching him trade..... LOL Excellent!!

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hello, I am new on this forum, and I like your technical aproach with this method, I only have one question at this time about the dots (SHI_Silver Trend Sig ), once they have been ploted and the bar has closed, on the future bars, If things go against this dot... could this dots disapear ? or what you see on the chart is what you get... I mean, the indicator doesnt "fake" on real time thanks. Walter.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I took a look at this nolagma_v5 I have noticed it doesn't show yellow areas... it only switches between light blue and tomato.... is that ok? What are you guys using? v4 or v5? Dan.-

--- 帖子 #689 ---
the 'SHI_Silver Trend Sig' does not disappear BUT it will keep moving with the next candle until there is an ACTUAL reverse ...it might move another 20 pips or maybe another 200 pips but at some point the signal will be good but I hope you can handle the drawdown...

--- 帖子 #690 ---
judex, The ignorepaint indicator works but only for the first signal. The next signal turn to repaint untill the actual reverse market. So, can you please modify the indicator so that all all the previous signals are ignorepaint. Looking foward to hear from u soon.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
are u alive//? send us a signal...

--- 帖子 #692 ---
any EA for this system?

--- 帖子 #693 ---
hi can someone post the newest best version of shi_silvertrend indicator? I hear there is one out there thats not repainting thanks ahead of time

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I have noticed that the indicators on this particular method work on the 5 minute time frame also, with a few bended rules. When the dots appear, they are always above or blow the next occuring dot, which equals profit. If you have the time to sit in front of your computer, then the indicators are excellent. Thanks again for the vaulable indicators. Once my account grows, then I can use the 4 hour charts. For now, I'm happy with what you have supplied to greatly enhance my entry and exit signals.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I did 2 trades this morning. I did cheap a bit and used the 15M time frame and made 7 pips The gbp/jpy I got in just a little bit too late but it appears to be holding it's own and going up. (red dot missing but there difinately is one there under the second bar) can't wait to start trading with real money...... See attched Pics...

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Again, Great system.....but I have a question: How is it possible to trade more than once a day using the 4 hour TF. Doesn't it take several bars to produce another signal.... So my point is two things..... 1. I see people posting that they have done 2 or more trades on the 4H TF using this system......how is that possible? and 2. Is it possible to trade on more than one time frame succesfully ( on my last post I made 7 pips on the 15M TF but I think I was more lucky than anything else..) Thanks Gang P.S. I've almost finished reading every single entry on this thread.....man that was long....

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Billser, IMHO, it is possible to do more than one trade per day especially for a very volatile pairs such as GDP/USD and GDP/JPY. But depends on the trend for that day. You're right...15m, normally we just got lucky and IMHO is not advisible. Happy Trading..

--- 帖子 #698 ---
How would you do that using the method used in this thread? Again I'm new to this stuff..... Thanks

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hi Dear judex001 That's a grat system. My question is : Which indicators and rules do you use ? Those that explained at first post or those at post #565 on page 38 ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #700 ---
GPD.USD just confirmed.. I"m also using the 4hr method by philip, it has formed a round bottom, and it confirmed under this system. So Vat does everyone tink?

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Dear Judex001, What about money management for this system? Please let me know. Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Hey everyone, First i want to thank Judex001 and other contibuters for the wonderful system! I made 42 pips so far using the tlatomi system today, this is my first trade using the system and followed all the signals in the right order. I am using the strategybuilderfx demo Trade is currently still running with the 42 PIPs Locked in 9:00 A.M EST 4HR Chart All Signals confirmed in order, took several hours to develop Bought 4 Lots @ 1.2947 Closed 2 Lots @ 1.2957 +20 Pips Profit (+10 TP x 2) Closed 1 Lot @ 1.2962 +15 Pips Profit (normally would close at +20, but near vegas fib. level) Last Lot is still open and currently 21 pips in Profit with trailing stop of 15 PiPs (stop has locked in 8 pips) Question for JUDEX001 or anyone who can help, Does it matter what broker platform we are using or do we just follow the system on any broker platform ?

--- 帖子 #703 ---
here is the chart See attachments

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Last lot has now locked in 28 pips in profit but is at 41 pips now and still going!!!

to Investor: You can use any platform you like to trade. Use MT4 for your implementation of the system.

Hey All, First thing i want to thank Judebox and OrangeRoshan for this great system. Just want to hear from people that tried it. Was it profitable for you? Thanks, The 4xMaster

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Thanks for the reply Dollabill, the reason i asked that is because not all brokers use the same time to calculate the 4 hr charts. Just was wondering if everyone got the same signal at the same time or does it vary among the broker your using

--- 帖子 #708 ---
First of all Thanks for this method, looks very good, but i've problem with this Tlatomi Method. for exam. today Feb/8/2007 Red dot appear then MA cross and CCI cross but when the new candle open the arrow appear with Blue dot in the same time. it's happen all the time i just don't understand, Please help guys.... Thanks Sumrin

--- 帖子 #709 ---
ok this my pic. Thanks

--- 帖子 #710 ---
This one better

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Did this occur during news time ? News time can sometimes cause this because the trend can go either way really fast at such a large move, and the indicators will respond to such moves. If this is not the case, Avoid the trade, it will be too RISKY. Usually, when a good trade is about to happen, all signals come in a generall good order but if i remember correctly, FX CCI Trigger must cross before MA's do. Remember, the signals are as follows for the best possible trade results 1. dot appears 2. FX CCI coss, this is confimed by the indicater data on the upper left side of the cci cross(best if cross occurs under -200 for long, and greater than 200 for short) 3. MA cross (confirmed by an arrow appearing) 4. Entry is on the open of the next entry bar (before you enter, to avoid a bad trade, use the ALLIGATOR indicator to confirm the trend, also check to see if price is near vegas fib points FOR THE FULL SYSTEM GUIDE, GO TO POST 565, created by the wonderful Judex

--- 帖子 #712 ---
After posting the message above, i went back to look at ur charts sumrin, and realized i encountered this same setup last night at 9:00 PM EST. Everything was perfect for the setup, but i really cant explain what happen cause i got stopped out by 30 PIPS. However, in your charts, the dot has repainted and i got stopped out before the opposing blue dot appeared. Maybe Judex or one of the more experienced traders with this system could help. P.S, this system is wonderful, however, its not the holy grail, so remember to have a proper and safe stoploss exit strategy if the trade is to ever turn against you

--- 帖子 #713 ---
The dots are not fixed. They are meant to say "Get ready for a change". The method says that the appears of an arrow only confirms entry. ( along with CCI crossing).

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Good point! thats what the dots are meant for "get ready for a change" too many people still trying to interpret too much out of the dots... INVESTER18- Also i think this is a great method but its important to be mindful of the longer timeframe trends like Daily and Weekly before making decisions. You go against the trend you will eventually get BURNED! Don't blame the method.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi Friends Thanks for this great system. Would you please tell me something about "Money Management" for this wonderful system ? How many Lots would be for each position ? How many orders can be active at the same time? What for a $1000 and $10000 deposit. Thanks

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Invester18, Simplecoders &amp; Mxb.... Thanks a lot i'm sure that Tlatomi Method is great one with this great team on forexfactory.com ok i've tray it on AUD/USD and it,s working fine i just got 50 pips last friday. NICE METHOD Best Regards, Sumrin

Hi Judex, Thks for sharing your genius systems. I've been following this thread and at the end, I felt that this thread is kinda messy (a good kinda messy full with informative infos, not full with junks ) ...could you please, update it at the first page if there is anything need to be added because post # 1 last updated on Aug last year...or is it finalized ?? Sorry if you find my English is quite disturbance as it is not my first language. Many thanks. EDIT:You have replaced the NonLagMA_v4 with Tiga Abdul correct ??

--- 帖子 #720 ---
SHI_silvertrend REPAINTS I noticed that the first week I started demo trading.did u replace with another indicator ?

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hi Mina, the only thing he replaced as far as i know was the NonLagMA_v5 with the Tiga Abdul...if u browse in this very thread, there was non repaints version of silvertrend but the experts prefers the repaints one. This SHI_silvertrend were only showing you the reversal of the trend, not the signal to do buy or sell...so it does work perfectly for large TF such as H4 or H1... happy trading...

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Would you post the summary of EA tlatomi plus its manual? Regards

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hello wackena, R u still there? Is there last version of Bogie_tlatomi after v1.0fb ? Would you explain me the meaning of all parameters that used? TQ.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
for the 5 and 9 MAs...are they appluied to open, close, or median?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hi Judex, how come when I load the SHI SilverTrendSig-3 the coloured dots are blue on the top (next to the red arrow) while in your chart are red, and red on the bottom (next to the blue arrow) while in your chart are blue ? I know I can change the colors, but I was wondering how they are appearing this way on my chart. Thx Max

--- 帖子 #726 ---
does anyone still use this method and it is still working perfectly?

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I trade it actually..made 200pips last week...but i still have a problem with the repainting of the silvertrend..can anyone tell me why the experts prefer this? i always forget to switch timeframes to refresh and so miss some good oppotunities... u can change colors in the preferences of the silvertrend.. i personally use the arrow version..but i always change them to size 3..is there any possibilitie i can safe that? i must always redo it when i open mt4.. thx a lot, aidan

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Hi, Where do i get the SHI SilverTrendSig-3?

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Hi, Which time frame do you use? H4?

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi! For the MA Crossover i use (Tlatomi TigaAbdul) FasterMode = 1 (means exponential) Faster MA = 5 Slower Mode = 0 (means Simple) Slower MA = 9 Also i use other Colors for them to distinguish between them und Silvertrend..i use the MA Crossover mainly because i dont want to have the 5und9 MA`s on my chart as i also have Fx Snipers LSMA (10,1500,3). I like clean charts Hope that helps Have a nice day!

Hi, No..i use an indicator to showme when the next 4H bar closes and watch every now and then... I use The LSMA for showing me the actual trend and for visual confirmation of an Tlatomi Trade...But i don`t always listen to it for conformation of an Tlatomi Trade...das an discretionary part.. Kind Regards, Aidan

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Hi sorry i dont understand ur question properly... U mean if thereis an email alert avaliable for the tlatomi method? as far as i know not..but u can only watch the 4H candles closes so u only must check ur computer every 4 hours... Hope that helps..if not dont hesitate to ask ! Also is there anyone else who is still actively using this method?

--- 帖子 #754 ---
I am getting the dots but I do not get any arrows afterwards. Which indicator produces the arrows? My Shi Channel does only dots.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
This thread still alive or has it moved?

--- 帖子 #756 ---
I notice the other tlatomi threads don't show any recent posts ...

--- 帖子 #757 ---
i think i like the look of the xparabolic indicator. pls how do u use it for support n resistance. what r the regression lines meant for? thanks

--- 帖子 #758 ---
I've looked at the code for this and it doesn't even follow the rules. I'll start a new EA from scratch. Since I see that this method has had the best results from a manual point of view, I'll be working on the automation of it. If I've got the wrong EA that I've been testing, let me know. I'll switch to the correct one, just someone tell me.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
i just finished reading the thread and am interested in this method. however the thread is confsuing and was wondering is alligator still in play? which indicators are used because there was a switch from the dots which to bounce around to arrows that arnt supposed too? im a little confused. cheers, jms

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hi, There also was an "f" version posted here though I think you have already found it as well.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
yeah, "f" doesn't follow the rules either. I'm going to have to write an EA on my own.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
i just found this tlatomi method today. Sincerely i'm really impressed, the method is so simple to use. The good thing abou it is that i just found it when the nonLagMA was forming. Though my entry was about 7-8pips late but it's nice. I'm hoping for some nice run down on the GBP and hope to exit when the red dot forms. The only problem i have now is the use of the EA's. After scouting round all the related threads on tlatomi, i found out that some pple use EA's (5 &amp;9) for better entries or exits. I'm not still clear with this part because after plotting the EA's, i saw that it was having some fakeouts. For now i'm sticking with the entries of the yellow nonLagMa on the open of the next candle for confirmation. Please let me know if you have made profits without fakeouts from the EA crossovers. Kudos to tlatomi....what a KIS System. Hope to run a test with it on other pairs.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
I am not sure but I think its trade the past ... I have turn on this system on PC 2 days and no any dot appears ...???? please could anybody explain ...???

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Hi, looks like a good system, money management with risk vs reward are key to me, can anyone give me an idea as to what levels stops are set. thanks

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Sad... My problem same like you...

--- 帖子 #766 ---
This is difficult to trade because the dots repaint all the time. Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #767 ---
What are you guys experience trading this method on the daily chart? I am currently forward testing this method on 11 currencies using daily charts. Just wonder what others have done on the daily chart.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Hi all, I found this thread a few months ago. The shi dots are interesting but I don't think you can use them as a definite trading signal. They do repaint themselves. So....I think of them as a warning. "Don't BUY anymore and Don't SELL anymore". It's time to take notice....trend change is possible, maybe probable. I've seen that occasionally there is a dot and the trend just continues. This says to me, "sit up and take notice, look at other indicators and follow price action" before initiating a trade. Good luck trademeister

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I Currently have been trading it on the 30 min chart with good success, I use the daily signals to determine my trading direction on the 30 min chart, then I only take trades in that direction. I enter with 2 lots, take profit on one at 15 pips, Bring my stop to entry on the second lot and let it run. It is a great system

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Congratulations on your success using 30M. I only trade the daily chart because of job situation. It requires alot of patience.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
yes not to mention great control over emotions, but if you are not in position to see the screen during your work hours, then those are eliminated and you just follow the trading plan.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Hello Money Magnet, what signals do you go by on the daily? The dots, MA or the CCI? I love your screen name! Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #773 ---
hi im new in forex and i still search for the best way .i feel your way is good but i find a problem to past it on my software. so can i ask you to help me . step by step .and thank you too much for help

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Thanks on the name, it reminds me all I need to do is focus oon trading well and the money will flow. The dots are my warning to watch for a trade, CCI must have crossed, then I use FX_snipers_LSMA confirm it has changed to green for long trades, then the MA crosover signal + I like to have the MA's Drawn on my charts. The problem wiht the daily is you get so many fewer signals, I like to use multiple timeframes so like the attached, Cable moved 100 pips down today, when I woke up the sell signal was there (4H), I did feel I was not too late to enter but it would be trading as aginst the trend, on 30 min I trade direction of last 4h signal.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Ramrocet, how are you doing with the Tlatomi method on daily TF? I would like to trade this method on the daily TF also.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
I don't trade it on the daily, I prefer to trade on 4h with more than 500 pips in the past month only on Cable, this could have been more but more the emotions that get in the way, but no complaints here. I believe your results on the daily would be better, once your have sorted out your trailing stop, if you use one and your intiial stop. I don't trade daily as i believe you need a stop of at least 100pips, whereas on the 4hr I use a stop of 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Hi Radi164, I think you need to do what most in this thread do, go to www.metaquotes.com and download meta trader, I use their charts, first I checked if their charts were a close reflection of the prices on my trading station. then read through the whole thread download the indicators and apply them.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Money Magnet, looks like you have mastered this method well. I have finished reading the whole thread post by post yesterday. It appeals to me very much. I have set up my charts and now I am ready to give it a go. Looks like you are the only one keeping this thread alive. Maybe everybody is too busy making money with this method. I hope so. I would like to know more about your way of trading this method. Mainly your money management. Are you trading only the cable? I understand that your SL is 50. What is the amount of lots you trade and how do you handle the TP? Are you trading with money or paper? What time zone do you live in? I know, I have too many questions. Your reply will be appreciated very much. Happy pipping to you

--- 帖子 #779 ---
My timezone is Gmt+2, My money management is as follows: I risk 3 % (some people say you should only risk 1.5%) of equity on any one given trade. I.E if I have $10000 I will risk $300, so If I am trading a 4 hr account, if my SL needs to be 50 I would leave the trade alone or trade a mini, similarly if I'm trading the 30min, and Sl is 15 I would trade 2 lots or another pair with similar SL, Currently I am trading 4 real accounts, 2 for friends of mine and two of mine, I use other strategy's as well, I do also like Phillip Nels macd one on the 4 hour, I started trading various other systems and went looking for something else when the one I was trading started giving lower returns. TP on 30 min I try and enter at least 2 lots, set at TP for one lot at 10 pips and let the other run, moving SL up by 5 pips at a time once i am up by 10 pips. 4 hr I look for divergences and bring my trail up, as well as all the usal, key support and resistance area's. Well I hope I have naswered all the Q's, Let me know if I missed anything. Focus on the system, don't fret about the money, Ask any doctor if he knows how much money he made today, He probably won't be able to tell you as he was just focussing on being a good doctor. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
You have to be patient on the daily as there are fewer oppotunities to trade. SL are higher 90 pips or so but when you catch a trade you only need 2 of this a month per currency. I set my MAs to 5/13 instead of 5/9S. I also use Phil Nel MACD for confirmation. I can't remember the rules about +200 &amp; -200. Do we only trade if the signal occurs in this range?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Ramrocket I am only repeating what was said in one of the previous posts. This is not from my own experience as I just started using this method. "Buy signal is stronger if Sniper crosses under -200. But you can also trade if Sniper crosses between -200 and +200." I am going to trade the daily and also the 4H as at suits my lifestyle. Had a good trade GBP/USD on daily. Good pipping to you.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
I am convinced! aud/usd +38 aud/cad +45 eur/usd +28 eur/chf +6 gbp/usd +21 usd/jpy +19 eur/jpy +80 gbp/jpy + 77 Total pips = +314 gained. 8/8 success ratio, zero collateral damage. All trades still running.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
So you are combining Tlatomi and the Phil Nel 4 hour MACD system? Or how exactly are you trading, do you mind sharing?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I'm curious as well. What timeframe were/are you trading this on?

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hi all Yesterday afternoon my time, the following trades came up. EUR/USD 30min and on 4 Hour Buy 1.3675 on both, This ran up overnight to 1.3735, personally I entered on this and closed out at 1.3710, as 50% retarcemant from downward move 23/7 was at 1.373 single lot = 31 pips and on my second lot I achieved 27 pips, I got in a little late. On GBP A buy entry @ 2.0245 biggest drawdown in the trade was 11 pips+spread this went on to over 2.03 I missed this one I was sleeping, there was an easy 20pips there, if you use some sort of strategy, where you enter two lots, you could have made 15 pips on your first lot, moved you second to B/E and have realized a full 60 pips. In fact in the last hour EUR/$ GBp and GBP/JPY have all give sell signals on 30 min charts where 20 pips would have easily been achieved. I am using this system because it works, If it does not I need to look at myself, my trading habits and dicipline. happy trading

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Hello pip hunters, I also had good 4H trade over night on USD/CAD. I agree with Money Magnet. The system is very good. Person must have the discipline to wait for the 5/9 cross. There are trades coming up on the daily TFs. Positive trades to all

--- 帖子 #787 ---
I am using this system with its own rules and combining it with Phil Nel MACD system. On daily I use 5/13E crossover and 5/9S on 4H. I use the MACD system for confirmation and also entry on high probability trades. I can enter a trade sooner than 5/9 crossover &amp; ergo/trigger crossover on high probability setups. I believe both systems are great compliments for each other so you can trade basically all currencies.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Money Magnet, you said that when trading 30m TF you determine your trend from daily. Which signal are you looking for? The last Shi, the 5/9 cross or the sniper? Sometimes I have the time to trade the 30m and I would like to test it. I had few successful trades on the 4H. So far not one negative. I am using the Shi, Sniper and the 5/9 cross only. Thanks for your reply. Cheers

I want to see the following and preferably in this order. SHI,fx cci cross, then FX_S_LSMA then either which ever comes first the 5/9 cross or MA Cross over signal, there is only a silght difference between the two, I like the visual appearance of the ma crossover signal. one point if you trade 1hr time frame the ma xover signal and 5/9 differ a bit more, so if I am on the 1 hour TF I'll use which ever comes first. Hope it helps Cheers

Money Magnet, sorry, I didn't make my question clear. I would like to know what are you looking for on the daily chart for confirmation when you are trading the 30m. Thanks

Hi Plauto2 I hope this helps, shout if you have any other questions or comments Money Magnet

Where is everybody? Keep posting and keep this thread alive. I am having great success .

--- 帖子 #793 ---
I having good results too.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
MoneyMagnet and RamRocket, If you guys can, would you each mind posting an exact step-by-step way in which you trade using this method? That would go a long way toward keeping this thread active. I think so many posts have happened in this thread that people are confused, but since you two are having success with it, if you were to post your step-by-step rules then we would all benefit. I would like to demo this method but am somewhat confused on the method itself. Possibly you can clear it up and more people will enter. Thank you.

Please take a look at the chart. Here is how I do it. Basically it has been discussed in great details here. I dont use other indicators like Silver Trend, Lag indicator, etc. Example 2 trade entries indicated by the 2 vertical lines. 1. 5/9 MA must cross (red &amp; blue) on the price frame. on the daily chart set this to 5/13 2. Ergo line and Signal line must cross (red &amp; blue) on frame 2 CCI (white on frame2) must already cross the Signal line 3. MACD confirmation (on frame 3) on high probability setups - I can enter sooner. You need to study Phil Nel's MACD system. Like I said before it is a great compliment to this system. The light blue and yellow dotted lines on the price frame I use for support / resistance levels.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
How did you get the moving averages on top of the MACD?

--- 帖子 #797 ---
can any body tel me the last rules of this system best regards

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Hello Ramrocket, I am glad that you are doing well with your method and thanks for sharing. I am calling it "your method" because it is so different from Tlatomi. The only thing that is unchanged is the 5/9, and even that is changed on the daily TF to 5/13. I have few questions for you. What is your reason for changing the 5/9 to 5/13 on the daily TF? What parameters are you using for the CCI? What value are the MAs on the price frame? Did you use this method for all those successful trades you had? Thanks. Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #799 ---
ssiam, welcome to Tlatomi thread. The original Tlatomi method is at the very beginning of this thread. I believe that there are few of us who trade with the original rules. I started trading with this method just recently and I don't feel qualified to post my trades. All I can tell you is that it is working very well for me. I am trading only the 4H and daily TF. More experienced traders like Money Magnet can trade the lower time frames with great success. Ramrocket developed method that is obviously working very well for him. But I think that we can't call it Tlatomi method as it is modified so much. It's very nice of Ramrocket to share it with us and I will definitely test it. So, to answer your question, we have here two trading methods. Regards, Pluto2

did anybody use other useful Indicators to instead SHI_SilverTrendSig?? thank u

I have few questions for you. What is your reason for changing the 5/9 to 5/13 on the daily TF? &gt;&gt; I've read this on this thread or the other Tlatomi threads. I believe the creator of the method mentioned it. I plotted 5/13 on the daily and you can enter sooner than 5/9. I prefer 5/13 on the daily chart. What parameters are you using for the CCI? &gt;&gt; 14 What value are the MAs on the price frame? &gt;&gt; EMA 30 &amp; EMA62 Did you use this method for all those successful trades you had? &gt;&gt; Yes I will not take the credit for this awesome method. As far as I am concerned this method came from Tlatomi - Tiga Abdul systems. The only thing I've added is MACD and price level support/resistance EMAs. I am now up +600 pips. I stop counting after 300 pips.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Hi Ramrocket, thanks for your reply. When I compare the time of cross of EMA 5/SMA 9 and EMA 5/SMA 13, I see that the 5/9 crosses earlier in most cases. How would that let you enter your trade sooner? Is there something I am missing? Thanks. Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #803 ---
5EMA/13EMA

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Ramrocket, can you post a screenshot?

--- 帖子 #805 ---
see post #56 just plot with 5E/13E. just closed these trades: nzd/usd = +18 usd/chf = +52 eur/chf = +13 83 pips gained. open trade: eur/usd = +36 pips so far.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
This is basically the same system I use, I do have a profile loaded with Phillip Nels system which I use as additional confirmation, support and resistance area's etc.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
RamRocket answered this, basicallt combining Tiga with Tlatomi. I tooalso use Phillip Nels system for additional confirmation.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
eur/chf = + 54 eur/jpy = +129 nzd/usd = +57 usd/chf = -18 usd/jpy = +43 usd/cad = +18 Total pips so far +283 pips. Update: closed all trades +301 pips

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Your screenshot can't be as simple as that, i thought you use macd?

--- 帖子 #810 ---
I use macd on the 3rd frame. yes it's that simple. don't complicate it. make decision 1-2-3 from top to bottom.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
What happend to this thread?

Is anyone still trading this system with profit?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
I ran across this thread last week and it looked interesting. I did some backtesting and forward testing and it appeared to be fairly profitable. However I also saw that the creator and/or original supporters of this strategy have moved on to different systems and strategies and apparently have abandoned the Tiga-Tlatomi method for what they believe to be greener pastures elsewhere. Boy - I'd sure like an answer to your question too!

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Can this Tlatomi method be use on any Timeframe other than H4?

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Sadly, this system, like many others, flourished for a while then crashed and burned as the reality set in that it was not a holy grail. The grail hunters have moved to pastures new in their everlasting hunt for easy riches. Are you off to join them in their pointless quest?

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Sorry, are you still using this method? thanks

--- 帖子 #370 ---
tlatomi is repainting. it does not work.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
is Tlatomi does not work on you...then find others..it might helped ya from other threads...yes..tlatomi repaint becarefull....

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hello. I found this thread while searching for the reason that SHI_SilverTrendSig does not work in backtesting. I am trying to build an EA using SHI_SilverTrendSig. The results yielded one trade. I printed the values of SHI_SilverTrendSig to the journal in the strategy tester, and all the values were a large default number. At the same time, I ran it live and crossed checked the values during the same time. The SHI_SilverTrendSig values in the live EA were as expected, however in the tester, they were all the large default number. (The one trade that was made was before any of the values for SHI_SilverTrendSig had been calculated. I don't know how that happened yet.) I tested wackena's theory to the best of my knowledge by printing Close[i] for ten loops. They all showed up fine while backtesting. Is wackena talking about something else? Does anyone know why SHI_SilverTrendSig does not backtest? Thanks, Unit01

--- 帖子 #373 ---
maybe using stochastic crossover to do filter would help. pm please send me the EA after add stochastic crossover.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Guees everyone blew there account using this method ey!

I really like what I see on my charts with SHI_SilverTrendSig also coded as Beginner Alert--(identical dot placements) since they call great pullbacks with the trend and i just ignore the countertrend ones, the only problem is they do not update on the bar close. At the bar close, I need to go into a different timeframe on my chart then back to the one i was in to find out if a new dot just appeared. Can you fix that for me? Whoever wrote it coded it for alerts and email which both work but only on each manually refreshed new dot appearance. I'm posting the version I have of Beginner Alert aka SHI SilverTrendSig. The only changes I made was to add code to add a variable called dist so that i can change the dot distance from the bar on a chart by chart input basis.

Its looks so good ... with manual back testing does it repaint !

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hey Steinitz, What are you up to now? Still trading? Retired?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi judex001, Are you still using this method? Have you modified it? If yes, could you please post a PDF. Thank you.
