Using two settings of zerolagMACD. zerolagMACD 5,10,5 and zerolagMACD 12,24,9 A cross of 5,10,5 gives early indication of trend change Entry is when 12,24,9 crosses. all time frames... For key to setting zerolagMACD alert see http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...84#post4642284 I am using Heinken Ashi which I prefer. I watch for pivots and support and resistance.. the 200 ema.. market open and close and data release... I like the way the template looks. Looks like a dragon Mostly I am trading 1min and 5 min but I will look at higher time frames to keep perspective... In the screenshot the stop is above swing high the target is S1... The screenshot shows what to look for. It wasn't an actual trade. Interesting how the 5,10,5 will very often (but not always and it is not necessary but is really nice when it does) show a head and shoulders when there is a change of direction coming... but it is necessary to wait for the 12,24,9 for entry. Since the 5,10,5 is so early there still may be upside before the actual turn. But when the 12,14,9 does turn the trade can be taken with confidence.

What to look for.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
5 min chart +6.3 pips

--- 帖子 #4 ---
what it looks like on the 1min

--- 帖子 #5 ---
1 min +2.4 pips (There was more to go)

--- 帖子 #6 ---
1 min +3.5 pips

--- 帖子 #7 ---
entered too early. didn't wait for slow macd to confirm. 15 min chart since I messed up the entry on lower time frames I looked at the 1h and it shows a long over due correction to the upside.. so I gave a bigger stop and set a higher limit. I prefer quick in and out on the 1min...

--- 帖子 #8 ---
1min +5.2

--- 帖子 #9 ---
On that bad entry. Got the cross on the fast zerolag, waiting for confirmation on slow zerolag.. 15min.. hovering around support at S2 looks like it was weak data going into London open sparked a sell off.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
okay got confirmation for cross on slow zerolag.. 15 min... The trade should be good...

--- 帖子 #11 ---
what looked like a cross may be a rejection.. slow zerolag.. It's a great set up for a super double bottom..

--- 帖子 #12 ---
can see the possible double bottom setting up on the 5min

--- 帖子 #13 ---
take the pain day chart shows 200ema next stop.. lesson. wait for the set up. The strategy works if I follow it... I know the best thing to do it to get out right away if the trade is wrong. I just have to do it.. Still in, let it play out... still looking at correction due on 1hr...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
actual confirmation on slow zerolag 15m Not the way I like to trade but maybe I will get out of this in one piece.. I could have taken several short trades on the 1min instead of trying to nurse this thing..

--- 帖子 #15 ---
hi there thnx for posting your system , how long have you been trading this and what is your hit rate for this system ,I would have thought it would give more accurate signals on higher timeframes

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I've been trading forever. This particular strategy has evolved over some time. I've only started trading it in its present form since starting the thread. It is good on all time frames. Personally I don't like big drawdown, so I like to trade faster time frames. this last trade I entered too early but by looking at higher time frames I decided it was okay to ride it out since it was due for a correction. Looks like it is turning around on support at S2. the 1hr looks good I wouldn't be surprised if EURUSD corrected all the way back to the daily wood pivot (yellow horizontal line)

--- 帖子 #17 ---
will try it out on few trades ,I like HA candles too

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Great, thanks for your interest. Keep us posted. the more the merrier...

did it again. didn't wait for the slow macd to confirm a cross 1min chart 1hr shows upside so now hold 2 positions long

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Can you tell us, please, how you set your targets? There's something i don't understand... some input on this would be greatly appreciated. Why do we need the 5,10,5 MACD since we enter on the cross of the 12,24,9? Thanks

--- 帖子 #33 ---
1 min +9.2

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Good question. 5,10,5 crosses early, and also shows divergence when a trade is setting up. The actual entry is when the 12,24,9 confirms by crossing. The combination of the two events gives a very high probability that the trade is good. Taken alone, either one by itself has too much guess work...

Jiva, what size stops do you use with spread? Whats your pip count for the day today buddy? Been following your screenshots since morning when you started the thread, I have to say if you continue with your method the way you have been today, you're going to do really well. You're already good at executing your trades. Just wanted to stop by and say well done Vish

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi, Been hanging out at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...53569&amp;page=295 Thisis the most reliable strategy I've ever traded. I'm almost taking it for granted, it's so good. Had 1 bad trade early today, got the entry wrong and tried to ride it out. Gave up on it. Tying margin up and I wanted to keep trading. Need the practice. Aside from that things went pretty well. Stops are above the recent swing high on whatever time frame the set up appears.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I thought id have a look what you are up to these days, lucky i did! Im having a look at todays entries and its looking pretty nice i must say. Im not used to looking at heiken Ashi so i cant read the PA at all, but im not so sure i would need to. You are definetely unto something here. I can see how you would whanna leave the long entries alone if EMA 200 is above and vice versa. SL around 20 something like that seems enough most of the time. Its very possible a really tight SL could be used instead, maybe like 8-10 and take a few losses now and then instead of one big one. But it all depends on how edgy you whanna be and stuff. TP seems to be around 10 often, see some 20 pipers for the brave at heart here and there. Anyway i think id set my prefixed SL to 20 and TP to 15, dont think id want to let either run much longer then that. Think im gonna check it out without the Haiken Ashi that stuff hurts my brain, at least until i get used to it. MACD is really sort of laggy things, but somehow you made this a nice concert anyway. So it think this kind of trading hits home on an average of strategies being used that packs a lot of punch (money). Anyway, im looking at M1 E/U for this so what im saying is about that. I am sure you dont mind if i screw around with your stuff a bit right? Thats how that looks like:

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks for the prompt reply, i really apreciated it! Can you, please, tell us how you set your targets? Thanks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Welcome, my good friend... Feel free to share your experience, insights, etc.. Maybe we can all learn something. The "trading edge" comes from the 2 settings of zerolag macd. I am amazed at the accuracy of this zerolagmacd. It gives much earlier signals compared to the standard macd. HA candles make sense to me. I'm accustomed to seeing them. They filter out a lot of the static movements... 1 minute chart is my favorite... I have some bad habits I need to get out of my trading. I still have a tendency to try to let a loser turn into a winner and then I will look for patterns to confirm that the trade will turn around. Meanwhile the losing trade gets bigger and bigger. I need to just admit that the entry is not what I thought it was and get out asap. I'm getting closer to being able to do that. I think it is related to how much confidence I have in the actual strategy. Like if I am confident of the strategy I will get out right away and be ready for the next trade knowing that I can make back a small loss easily. But if I have doubts about the strategy then I may want to hang on because I don't think I can have winning trades. So I need to hold on to the loser hoping it will become a winner. With this strategy I can break that pattern.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Your welcome. Thanks for taking an interest. My favorite is the 1min chart. So the action is usually pretty quick. If I can take 5 pips I take it. After all it's the 1 min and in a few minutes there will be another set up. There could be a lot of trades in a session. My goal is as little drawdown as possible. So I look to see where the last swing high is because that is where a stop would logically be. Either mentally placed or actually set. But if its the 1 min maybe there isn't enough time to set it with the broker. And maybe that is better if I don't since who knows what these brokers are doing. Maybe they will see the stop and jump to grab it. Same with a target. Maybe not enough time to set it with the broker. Of course it is dangerous since there may be some technical problem with the server or something and I may not be able to access the trade for exiting. So a good idea would be to set an emergency stop and target, maybe something 30 pips away, just in case of a power outage or server crash or something. So that would be the worst that could happen, and it is survivable. A target consideration is how close the price action comes to support and resistance. Mostly I am looking at the 200 ema, and the wood pivots, s/r. They can be targets. Evidently there are book orders placed at these places because price action always increases in these areas. So they can be targets... especially for trading higher time frames. But the 1min means 5 pips and I'm happy. 10 pips and I am very very happy. Wait a couple of minutes and look for the next set up. Time spent in watching the chart makes a huge difference. I have used a million templates. But I always come back to this one. It just makes the most sense to me. The more I use it the more sense it makes.

Should have closed that second one at around +2.5 when i had the chance...well woulda, shoulda, coulda as they say. I hope you guys can see the script objects, if not try zooming in on the pictures and it should be clear. Now its time for coffee.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
How I would see it...

--- 帖子 #48 ---
So maybe you attribute more to the divergence then to the cross of the MACD lines?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
divergence on the 5,10,5 is amazing. It happens early. before price action shows any weakening.. Then the 12,24,9 crosses and the move is confirmed. This happens so reliably I'm getting scared!!! this can't be real can it? But it is... The 5,10,5 is so predictive it's phenomenal. But I can't enter on the prediction, only when it is confirmed by the 12,24,9 then it's good as gold, so to speak. (Or is that silver)?? this filters out 99.9% maybe even 100% of false signals.... So divergence is king.... If I'm trading the 1m and the 5 min supports it's even better. But this is only with the zerolag macd... regular macd won't work...

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Yeah i stumbled into some thread about regular MT4 MACD, this dude was saying the calculations where all wrong. In fact that math isnt hard to do at all so its not hard to check it by the book. But anyway, what matters is what works and what dont right? Well ill check out the divergences during that day and see what i can see.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Interestingly yaed I set up my fast macd the same as yours with 5,10,10 instead of 5,10,5! Which of course makes the cross a little later. I've checked both on my charts for comparison and the difference is worth checking... pete

yikes, the template had the wrong settings for fast zerolag. Thanks for mentioning it in the thread. I corrected it. should be 5,10,5.. almost 300 people may have downloaded the wrong settings.. It was in the description, 5,10,5 hope they noticed... trading the 1 min the settings can be very sensitive...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The difference is not huge, in some candles it can make a difference, but often it doesnt. I would want to have a huge screen for this though, something like 40-50" inch would be great, so i can see both the PA and both the MACDs clearly that would be cool. Think im going to stick to the divergence + MACD cross setups though, setups on only the crosses are pretty screwy. Alpari where not collecting any stars in my book, requoted me at +4 so i had to take a chance and wait and get out at +1.5 instead

--- 帖子 #57 ---
You're on the ball, divergence is indeed both a potent and formidable confirmation... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Wish i held unto that one a bit longer, but i did not see that big drop candle through 1.41 coming, but i guess a bit of + is a lot better then nothing.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions! It was a real eye-opener. I'm going to start testing your most interesting system and i'll report back. thanks once again

Hi Jiva34, Thanks so much for this really nice trading system. I think it's a winner. I just want to say that sometimes the 5,10,5 doesn't show divergence, but the 12,24,9 does. I'm going to attempt to post a chart that shows this. It's on Eur/Jpy M5. Notice the long run down following the divergence. Very nice! Carol

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi, glad you're getting something out of this. I'm sure it is a winner. There may be other strategies that can be developed using zerolag divergences. I personally want to concentrate on just the one set up. Get it so ingrained in my brain that I can recognize the set up with my eyes closed??? anyway I want to get so regulated using this pattern that it's boring. The same pattern over and over and over again... No deviation. then maybe, maybe I could look for modifications.. I do find that finding the divergence on the 5,10,10 and waiting for the cross on the 12,24,9 is very reliable. I don't worry too much about the divergence on the 12,24,9. Since I'm trading the 1min the fast zerolag is very significant.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
looking at your screenshot: using the strategy that I'm using I would have found the entry. The purple lines show there is divergence on the 5,10,5 and the entry is where the purple arrow is. that it is confirmed on the 12,24,9 is frosting on the cake...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
That's it for today.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi Jiva34 Great Idea! Divergences to trade at smallest time frames. Why not? Keep up the good work! FXcube

Hi all. Could anyone give me this one in *mq4, please? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/attach/ex4.gif Market_Open_Lines c.ex4 (6.6 KB, 233 views) I don't like *.ex4 where I can't read the code. Thanks. FXcube

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi jiva I like your trading ethos, as it rings true with mine. Wait for the good trades and keep the losses tight. I will compare my scalps (purely naked PA, extremely short term, 5m &amp; 10sec charts) with your system and report any interesting points. Regards, JC

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Jiva Quick question. Do you wait for the candle to close with the slow MACD crossed, before opening a position or is it deiscretionary. Doubt it will make much of difference very often at this TF, but could in choppy PA. Also, I cannot see what your signal was in your quoted post. You opened after the slow cross? Just trying to understand the details to help make any worthwhile suggestions or findings. Regards, JC

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Can anyone add a simple alert to the zerolagmacd line that can be turned off...so I could get an alert on the longer crossing? Audio pop up telling what pair and time ie zerolagmacd cross up eur usd at x time!!? Brian

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi, Sorry I don't have mq4. You could put some time into searching ff maybe turn it up.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
hi, good questions. attention to details is really inportant for this kind of trading. I mean a trade can be a matter of seconds!!! yes, definitely wait for the candle to close on the 12,24,9 to confirm the cross. if you miss a trade so what this is the 1 min. Go get a snack and come back and there will be a whole new setup forming. Better to miss one and keep your capital than to enter wrongly and lose it...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
hello, Brian.. nice to see you..

--- 帖子 #83 ---
The same to you Jiva.. very nice, my congratulations and appreciation. Very nice Brian

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks. It's looking good...

--- 帖子 #85 ---
It's real tempting to jump in before a candle closes. But from the screen shot here is why not to do it. This is on the 15 min but it holds true for all the time frames. Everything was in place for a long trade. divergence on the 5,10,5 and it looked like a cross on the 12,24,9. But at the last minute it didn't cross... this happens a lot with macd. That's why using the 2 settings together is really good. The combination filters out bad entries.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks to Hanover for adding this alert for me... fantastic! For anyone interested: An option if you are trading the M1/M5, is to have the alert on your M5 chart to help alert to when to really watch the M1 after a fresh M5 cross. I hope you don't mind me posting Jiva, in case anyone else might find this helpful as well. RE: AlertCandle: If negative, then no alerts. If 0, then will alert if blue crosses red while current candle forming. If 1, then will alert if blue crosses red after current candle completes (becomes second last candle) and new candle starts to form.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
tried to trade the 5min - 24.4 Think I will stay with the 1min did not want to take drawdown, on the 1 min I don't have to. other time frames means certain amount of drawdown. As it was, I got caught in a downdraft where the brokers were taking the stops out. This happens regularly at market opens and closes. Now it has reversed back up. That is why I prefer the 1 min, no drawdown and in and out fast. so the next time I see some pretty set up on time frame other than the 1 min I need to remember how this works. Drawdown....

Really nice divergence... quick 5 at R Brian

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Any input from any one is appreciated. Maybe the first two divergences where a little to flat?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Yaed - I think your understanding of divergence is all wrong. Perhaps you could review it at say, Babypips.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Could you be specific?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Woah... I think Yaed knows what he is doing, but it is a new setup. Was the first trade a long Yaed? I dont like the indicator or the price to be not making a new short term high or low ie... if going long I dont want the indicator to have a higher cross or price to be higher than my long entry in the recent swing high and vice versa shorts. Unless this was not a long, then I misunderstand the pic. The second one, I dont use the short term zmacd for entry, I would have been in much earlier..there was already divergence when the longer zmacd crossed down... getting in there would have been good.. again I know you know what you are doing, but for me I dont enter in that situation if it setup there, just plenty of trades to not take them right near s/r even waiting for price to close beyond,lower prob. The third one I believe is perfect.. just hitting its head on resistance, if you were patient paid out just fine All the best Brian

ok to post more macd divergence trade set uos? or only the macd no lag ones?

If it's ok with j34, only non lag ones please

Yupp im not used to these kind of trades. I think the divergence slope wasnt very steep for it to be a good entry on the first two. Also first one the entry/signal was very late.

1st one wasn't really divergent. same direction 2nd one. signal to enter was eventually good, but it came a little early so there would be some dd (I hate dd) It was a wild ride this morning. spiking up, spiking down, stop hunting, limit orders taken out, etc. brokerfest...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Let's keep this dedicated to zerolag divergence... staying focused is important to me. I get easily distracted. this strategy is good so I don't want to get off track, which is really really easy for me to do... With the world economy in turmoil and geopolitical unrest everywhere, coming hyperinflation certain I feel the pressure to get my trading to another level. It may be my only source of income in the not too distant future. Assuming we still have electricity, internet, brokers and a forex market.

The actual technical strategy is working very nicely. But there is another part to trading strategy. the money management part. What I'm doing is: I have opened a demo with FXDD for $200 the idea is to build the account by trading .01 lot per $100 balance. In 2 days so far the account is now $210.82 trading .02 lots. When it gets to $300 I will trade .03 lots. When it gets to $400 I will trade .04 lots. etc... This will be the real test of the strategy. That I can actually build an account balance. Not just have some good trades every now and then...

First of all my compliments, you seem to really nail the market here About your mm: why don't use more than those lots? Your biggest losses seem to be just 10/15 pips, with such losses you can afford to take bigger lots and still risk relativly low % of your account. About the trategy: I can't seem to find exactly what your doing here, but whatching your screenshots i think your watching for a divergence on the faster MACD, then waiting for a cross on the slower MACD, then take the trade. Right? And you set tp &amp; sl, both never gets hit, so why do you set them? And how do you decide when to exit? Just when you banked a couple of pips or really watching the macds for that?

Ok ill meditate on that.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
hi, I suppose I could do more than .01/$100 but I'm not in a hurry. It will build and there is exponential growth. There's enough stress in just trying to get the trade right without putting extra stress by worrying about potential loss. The less stress the better. You've got the strategy right. Very very simple. Just a 1 - 2 punch. sl and tp are set just in case the site goes down, or mt4 goes off line for whatever reason or something like that. In case I can't access the trade. Power outage??? If I can catch 5 pips I'm happy. It's the 1 minute chart. If I can catch 5 pips I can comeback in a couple of minutes and catch another 5 pips. Swing trade. drawdown is minimal. And I'm not just sitting in a trade waiting for something to happen. The longer I am in a trade the more possibility there is for risk.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thank you very much for that. But i still don't quite get how you determine the exact moment you enter a trade. For example the pic you just posted, why do you enter there and not for example a couple of bars back (where there already was a 2 bar retracement)? At that moment there already was a divergence and the slow MACD already crossed. Again, just trying to understand you here, cause your on fire

--- 帖子 #125 ---
that's it for today..

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Took this one for example, divergence, long macd crossed so took the trade, but went bad so closed at -9 pips. Why is this a bad one?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I guess you are referring to this screenshot. Usually the entry is when the 12,24,9 zerolag crosses and the candle closes. And the trade would have been just fine if that was done. But sometimes as in this case, the candles were approaching a strong area of resistance. Just from experience, I've been trading this template forever, I see that candles will go to support or resistance if they are close to support or resistance. In this case I use the wood pivots. So I didn't want to enter the trade short if the resistance had not quite been reached yet. I waited until the candles reached the resistance and reversed. The basic strategy is very simple. the 1 - 2 punch. Even without any fancy subtlies it can be traded successfully. There are subtle situations that I can't give cut and dry formulas for. Just from experience there are probably 100's of little hints and clues that may tell me not to enter a trade just yet. As I say I have been trading for several years. This stuff is learned over time by practicing. The only way I know for someone else to learn these things is that they put time into following the charts and experimenting for themselves. Then some of the subtle aspects will reveal themselves. The basic strategy is good. even without the subtle aspects it can be traded successfully. Individual traders will find their own nuances. Anyway that's the best I can do with that. Practice practice practice. Anyway that particular trade was a little atypical. Some of the other screenshots should be clearer for entry.

Just looking at your screenshot I don't see how you could have entered short where you indicate you entered short. Looks like you entered a lot earlier. If you had entered later I think you might have just rode out a little bit of dd and had a good trade eventually. Do you have more information available for the trade? Like time of day? Was it near a market open or close? Was there data released? And what happened in the later bars? What happened later on? Today was a tough day. Lots of spikes. I think the brokers were having a stop hunting festival all day. Is this EURUSD? I think I remember that part of the trade session. That if you had stayed in the trade a little longer it did eventually turn short. But there was a last gasp of upward pressure before it took the dive. I hate it when that happens. Drawdown and risk loom their ugly heads. Sometimes looking at the 5 min or 15 min can give a clue as to where things are going even if the 1 min is spiking up. That happens sometimes. Especially on a day like today. A rollercoaster.

Thanks a lot for the explanations. The setup was indeed on EURUSD at 15:13 GMT. No news as far as i know, the trade just was a short retracement, after that eurusd went up again. After +/- 25 pip drawdown it went back to the entry price, but i guess that's way to much for the kinds of profit you take with this system, as far as i've seen you won't let is go like 15 pips against you? Just on demo btw, trying to do some practice Will try a couple of trades more &amp; start some practicing. Since you have been trading it for a longer period, what would be your average win rate and R:R? Again, thanks so far, curious to see if i can get some winners here!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I took a hit today for -24.4 pips. The set up was there but all of a sudden there was a spike, like I say, I think the brokers were stop hunting a lot today... I didn't want to risk more than that so I took the pain. And then it turned around and had a huge move which would have been a big winner. Even with the owie, ended up around +60 pips... for the day. It's gonna happen. The idea is to minimize the losses. Filter out as many bad entries as possible. For the 1 min chart 5 or 10 pips is very respectable. I'll take +3 rather than risk a loser. I can always get back in. Have just started trading this particular strategy right around starting the thread. win rate for last 3 days looks like 89.5% good luck with it. Keep us posted.

I havn't had much time to do look at this, but having had a quick look at a fairly rangy EURUSD day like today (daily inside bar), using the long zerolag MACD at the extremes of the indicator, with common sence PA triggers, seems to generally generate good signals with maybe one or two false signals needing a fairly easy PA SL to escape with low losses. Not that I have given any numbers, charts or evedance to support my statement above, but with this is not yet taking into account divergence, so I recon jiva could have a winner. Time will tell. I still need to look at a strong trending day with a large range to see how it operates on the other end of the spectrum. Also, this system or a variant of it, could be the swing trade scalp signals to support a breakout scalp system, obviously the two systems providing similar signals at creatain times. I for one hate swing trading, but this could be a viable option. Jiva can correct me, but this is not a purely technical system that one can follow blindly. The signal might be defined but not every signal should be taken. There is certainly an element of PA intuition that is required to avoid the bad trades. But then which scalping system can ever be purely technical? It all needs a bit of experience filled common sense. Regards, JC

nice.. divergence there on both 5,10,5 and 12,24,9.. looks like you've got it. don't get bored. If we just keep doing the same thing over and over and over again... we will build an account. Just keep ringing the register... I spend time on http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...57#post4639357 and research topics on youtube... etc. in between set ups...

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I don't want to confuse anyone but I want to show something why we only look for divergence on 5,10,5 and entry on 12,24,9. why we keep those functions separate... If there is divergence on 12,24,9 that is good as long as divergence is also there on 5,10,5.. That further confirms a good entry. But 5,10,5 is the primary concern for divergence. In the screenshot, there is divergence on 5,10,5 but the exact opposite on 12,24,9. But it is good trade. 12,24,9 only should be used to find the entry point at a cross..

Spreads tend to be little wider in Asian session ...

--- 帖子 #143 ---
caught this on screenshots... how when candles are approaching s or r it is better to wait until they actually reach the s or r even if there is divergence. There very often is a little pressure that drives the candles to the s or r before it reverses... Evidently there are order waiting there and the brokers jump to catch them... 1min +2.7 right in the middle of the trade lost connection, yikes, that's why I use the emergency stop and limit...connection came back on after a few seconds...

--- 帖子 #148 ---
little out of my league but The indications for short are confirmed on several time frames. entered short on 30 min chart. Do so dislike dd, looking to get into profit quickly...

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I think I'm finally getting cured of trying to trade any other time frame than the 1 min... Entered on the 30 min chart signal. But the volatility causes so much dd and risk. they say the 1min is the most risky to trade. I don't see it. I think it is the least risky to trade!!! So it appears they may be the usual spike at London open as the brokers try to grab the stops and limits before heading down. the strategy is good. But nothing is 100%. I personally can't live with drawdown. Maybe I will remember this the next time I am tempted to trade something other than the 1 min. Maybe this is the last time I fall for the temptation. It's just not the way I want to trade..... So there you have it, my confession.... Perhaps a better way for me to approach this, given my risk tolerance, which is almost 0, is if I see that there is downside on higher time frames I could favor short position on the 1min. I know what happened this time. I thought (that's the problem right there...., I thought) anyway, I saw that there was downside on the higher time frames and I though I might miss entries because if the move was fast there would be no entry points using divergence. So greedy little me got in without carefully looking for an entry. In a sense it would be better for me in the long run if I have to take a hit on this, no pain no gain, if I manage to be lucky and come out ahead I may be tempted to do it again. Whatever.... this just isn't the way I want to trade... discipline is the secret to success.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I moved the stop a little further away because I'm pretty sure this is stop and limit order hunting by the brokers right after London open. It is a very lucrative part of their business. they can see where the stops and limits are. When a new market opens the brokers go shopping. Another aspect to my lamentation about taking a trade on anything other than the 1 min. is that I have to sit in the thing for who knows how long. I could have taken 4 or even 5 1 min trades by now. What I am counting on is the next time the opportunity is there and it looks really good on a higher time frame I will catch myself and remember these things. Time, drawdown, and risk are all increased on the higher time frames.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hello Jiva, I like this one as it reminds me of my temporary indiscipline Excellent thread, simple but useful method, 2 components which I prefer most! One short question concerning your stop loss management, do you consider exiting a trade if you have contrary signals? E. g. you are short and the 1) the 5-10-5, and afterwards the 12-24-9 produce long signals ? Or do you stick to your trade and wait for hitting the original SL ? Thanks in advance .... Best wishes!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
+3.8 No doubt the candles are going to the 200ema and r1. But I've had enough. It's just not my way of trading.. first sign of gain and I am out..................... Back to my comfort zone, the 1minute.... I want to remember the distress from this the next time a higher time frame flashes me a "come on". Remain faithful.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
As soon as it becomes obvious that it is a bad trade I get out... that could happen in any number of ways. What yu have described is one way. Also I look at the 5 min and 15 to see if they are supportive of the trade. These trades are generally so quick it is not a problem. The losing trades I have had have been when I have deviated from the actual strategy. My stop loss is there only in case of power failure and I can't access the platform...

It's a really simple strategy and it works. Happy to hear you are getting the idea... If you are using real money I suggest a demo but if you insist on real money then use a micro. Forex is brutal and will take all your capital. I am trading in a demo until I have shown I can actually build the demo account. I opened the demo for $200 and am trading .01 lots per $100. If I can successfully do this in the demo then I will open a micro for $200 and do it for real. There is more to trading than having some good trades. There is money management. We want to build the account balance. good luck..

This is scalping on the 1min.. I don't stay in the trade for more a few pips. After a minute or 2 there is another set up. Very minimal drawdown, very little risk (since the signals are very reliable) I like HA candles because they filter out the jerky movements of Japanese candles. What specifically are referring to for taking advantage of HA candles? since this is 1min scalping I am not looking to capture a long trend move.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Youre absolutely right , and iam not talking about catching a trend , but your exits are looking random to me , if you use heikin ashi , why dont make use of there shape and/or colur change on closing/opening ? I have taken some trades based on your startegy , and just use the HA for exit , and mostly that would have been the better trade ... But of course a few trades dont make a hard evidence

Hi Jiva cant see it mentioned anywhere (but may have missed it) do you wait for the Heikin Ashi (the olive/green one) to be the appropriate color before entering - it appears so, but would like to be sure It also appears that the Heikin Ashi smoothed has no real function, you do not appear to be using it to confirm the larger trend, therefore what is it's purpose.

Hi Jiva34, Thanks for sharing a great system. Today i took 14 trades and lost 2 for a net total of 45.5 pips. I'm risking 2.5% on each trade assuming a "panic stop loss" of 10 pips. My account today increased by 8.12%. This really looks great... but it is on demo. I'm affraid the brokers will kill this excelent method on a real account through slippage and requotes. what do you think about this? Thanks once again!

waiting for ha to change to appropriate color.. yes that is a good idea if you want to catch bigger moves. the ha smoothed doesn't have a particular function per se, just a visual guide for general trend.. the 20 ma, red line is good to watch. if an entry is indicated long below the 20 that is good, and if an entry short is indicated above the 20 then is good. possibility of some legs is there...

--- 帖子 #182 ---
the trades are scalp trades. they happen so fast who has time. I have a stop and a limit set for an emergency, like if power goes out. limit 15, stop 30.. The trades can sometimes happen in a matter of seconds...

GBPCAD, H1, 2011 Mai 26 It must be done!, ...may be for others not too early, better to wait for the MACD (12,24,9) crossover. It's only my personal style to use these excellent tools in combination with the market environment just now with an earlier preferred short.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
This strategy is not for strongly trending fast moving markets. It is very good for rangebound, and markets that are consolidating. Where there are a lot of swing movements. After all we are looking for divergence which is an indication of trend change.... At some point I would like to see how to use the zero lagmacd for identifying trend continuation which would be ideal for trending markets and catching big moves. But for now I want to concentrate on looking for divergence on the 1 minute in rangebound markets. I'm sure I could build an account balance very nicely with just that alone..

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I must be honest. Afterall the point of posting the thread is to share and learn. I have done the unforgivable. Not honored the emergency stop of -30. And now I am stuck in the trade at a big loss. There is no excuse for this. I know better. Down about -50 pips No strategy is 100% right all the time. Things happen in the markets. Talking heads say things that move the markets, geopolitical events happen, surprise! anyway whatever, the entry long was there I took it and the market dipped and then just kept going. If I had taken the loss early, 15 or 20 pips when it was obvious something had gone wrong, I would be able to make it back relatively easily. At worst to let the emergency stop at -30 take it out. But now it's -50 pips and who know if it will turn around.. This is why I am trading demo. Until these kinds of bad habits or whatever are gone, I cannot trade real money. We have all been here and done that. To be successful there must be discipline. I'm getting close to being able to trade with the necessary discipline. Stick to the 1 min chart and take a loss as soon as the trade does not act the way I had analyzed it would. It's a tough one for some of us. But if I am going to actually be successful I will have get passed this. It is the biggest stumbling block. It's lunch time NY, London has closed. The candles are sitting on the wood pivot, I'll leave things alone for now and monitor the price action. I expect some retracing. Look for a suitable exit.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi Jiva wouldnt then it just be a case of looking for hidden divergence on the zerolag macd for trend continuation lower high on price, higher high on zerolag (hidden bearish) higher low on price, lower low on zerolag (hidden bullish) I am assuming of course that you are basing the divergence calculations on the MACD line not the signal one or have i misunderstood something again.....

For any scalping system where profit is taken at the first sign of stalling, it is probably the number 1 mistake to ride a loss. Losses can get out of hand so quickly and all of a sudden one bad trade takes out a few days worth of profits. There goes RR out the window. A lesson I learnt the hard way many times in scalping is, rather stop out many times with the likelyhood that you will break even for the day or suffer a slight loss, than feel the heart wrenching, gut ripping feeling that you should have cut and run, but didn't. For me the tight SL and emergency SL is to avoid emotional derailment. I hate that feeling. Regards, JC

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Pain has its benefits, even emothional pain. It makes us think twice the next time. Hopefully it will happen again before you move onto a real account, to engrain the feeling into your mind. Reagrds, JC

Hi All/Jiva like many I get confused with divergence and constantly switching the rules about in my head (so many things to know in forex, so little space in my brain!!) therefore I always have indi's to help, I have recoded the zero lag MACD to also plot divergence. to make it easier the defaults are based on the 5/10/5 macd, though everything can be changed. a little picture below to help people visualise what i have done Regards John

hi guys, Nice thread you have here Jiva, ive been running this through Forex tester and so far the expectancy is very high, the only thing that concerns me is how the results could differ on a live account due to slippage but I guess theres only one way to find that out.

Could every divergence trade as a divergence? This is not invariably the case! Next, let's take a look at an example of some hidden divergence. Once again, let's hop on to the daily chart of USD/CHF. http://www.babypips.com/school/image...ivergence1.png Here we see that the pair has been in a downtrend. Notice how price has formed a lower high but the stochastic is printing higher highs. According to our notes, this is hidden bearish divergence! Hmmm, what should we do? Time to get back in the trend? Well, if you ain't sure, you can sit back and watch on the sidelines first. http://www.babypips.com/school/image...rgence-end.png If you decided to sit that one out, you might be as bald as Professor Xavier because you pulled out all your hair. Why? Well the trend continued! Price bounced from the trend line and eventually dropped almost 2000 pips! Imagine if you had spotted the divergence and seen that as a potential signal for a continuation of the trend? Not only would you be sipping those margaritas in the Caribbean, you'd have your own pimpin' yacht to boot!

Experienced traders know these things... Thanks for the support. It is a major hurdle for successful trading.. Some of us are a little slower than others in getting past this... The spur of the moment can and does confuse us sometimes. The illusion is very strong. But it is an illusion. Trading must be approached scientifically to be successful. The test is when the temptation is presented. Do I throw all my "understanding" and "science" out the window and reach for a "pie in the sky"? Reminded of a little story: A dog was dressed up in a king's outfit, fancy crown, royal robes and placed on a thrown and was receiving homage, respect, and had charge of the treasury. He had all success. Someone nearby threw a bone and he jumped down into the mud and dirt to grab it. So the real test will be when I am faced with this again and I will be... Probably today. Maybe the very next trade.. Woof?

The trades are very fast. I just have an emergency stop set for 20 pips. It is really only in an emergency, like power outage or the site goes down, like that... Or as in the above posted case the trade goes wide against. I am not looking to stay in the trade for more than a few pips. +9 was a lot for this strategy. The trades can be a matter of seconds. +2,+3, +5, +9, whatever. So in that sense I do not have a stop based on the strategy. Only an emergency stop in case the lights go out and I can't access the trade. This is not looking for a big gain on a single trade, it is high probability trading, not high profitability trading. The r/r will be a lot higher in hi probability trades. I am willing to give this some time to see if the account balance can actually be significantly increased in this way. Started with $200 demo, for the 1st 4 days of trading it is up $15.48 or about 13%. Over a year that would be about 650%.. Kind a silly to make that leap to a conclusion after 4 days of trading... If it is a good system, after a year of experience with it the gain would be a lot more than 650%....

EU - (-0.4) Pips Hidden Bearish Divergence - hidden bullish divergence appeared shortly after opening so closed at small loss NB. Switched back to using normal candles as cant read HA candles properly yet.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi All well I have concluded today's testing, and I must say I am impressed 6 Trades - 2 losses - Pips +24.4 1 loss of 9 pips was a mistake on my part by not looking at S&amp;R lines Missed some good trades, due to the fact that they came right after a losing trade and I was busy posting the losing chart (tut tut). Also missed/exited some trades due to the fact that I couldn't read the standard HA candles For my own personal use I have added the filter of not trading against the HA smoothed candles. Will continue to test next week and post my charts both winners &amp; losers (though hopefully more winners than losers!!) Have a good weekend all. Regards John

holiday in US, will still keep an eye on Europe. this indi repaints.. So in back test it looks perfect. I may use it to simply show present direction on a higher time frame... Of course the direction can change in a second.. the indi produces arrows on a 2 bar reversal...

EU - (-6.3) Pips Hidden Bearish Divergence - Hidden Bullish divergence appeared after opening so closed for loss

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Looks like today might be a real drag to trade with holidays in both UK &amp; London there doesn't seem to be much movement and as I use the precaution of not trading against the HA smoothed I need bigger waves Though i have now noticed that with not trading against the HA smoothed I can use the cross of the fast MACD (especially for re-entry when the first cross occurred on the wrong side of the HA)

2 instances of divergence. Been watching these. divergence that does not involve zerolag crossing 0 and divergence where zerolag does cross zero. Am curious about the significance if any.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
here's the question.. is this divergence valid or has it been nullified since zerolag crossed 0? (ignore the market open lines, they're not right)

--- 帖子 #263 ---
super cautious today.. +1.9

--- 帖子 #264 ---
re: post 262 Hi J, I don't worry about the zero line at all, although it may suggest that the divergence has run out of steam. So long as we have LH's on the fast nonlag to connect a descending line to, it's a valid trade with the appropriate PA. However, as soon as two HL's can be connected with enough space between them, the previous LH's become invalidated. Also when one divergence has been traded (as would have been a couple of candles after Tokyo Open), I would look for a new divergence... What are your thought on this? pete

--- 帖子 #265 ---
EURUSD - (-21.8) Pips Made several compounded mistakes today which resulted in this big loss 1) Went short when Regular Bullish Divergence had been indicated 2) The cross of the Slow MACD was more of a "brush" than a cross with intention 3) Did not take the 2 opportunities (marked on chart) where I could have got out with a reasonable loss of a few pips (the first one ok, how was I to know that it wouldn't go down further, but the second PA had already indicated that a small loss was the best option)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Taking losses is part of it. Very sad when it happens. But it happens. I'm sorry for your pain. I know the feeling. I just didn't see any signals today. I think the market was just not good for trading this strategy today. So many time times in the past I have tried to trade a market just because I wanted to trade and it was always a disaster. So today I said to myself, no, I don't see the signals. I took a couple of very quick trades... That was it.. Total for the day was +8.8 pips... that was it.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Jiva, First of all thanks a lot for uploading your system, i have been testing it lately and im having great results with it, even today the market its not favorable to this strategy i have managed to squeeze roughly 20 pips so far... i have been trading in a demo account however i wished to switch to a real money account or at least to a demo account offered by a broker providing roughly the same spread in demo and real, i know that for example Alpari demo and Alpari Pro has roughly the same spread however 20K its a little bit to much... do u have any suggestions for a broker? Best regards!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
hi, happy to hear you are getting something from this... I used FXDD Malta forever. Decent spread on EURUSD, little high on other pairs.. great execution, $200 to open micro, site hardly ever goes down, no requotes. was really happy with them. But switched to AAAFX for certain reasons... cannot discuss here. AAAFX has little wider spread on EURUSD but better spreads on other pairs. Seems decent in execution... Good luck...

EURUSD - +5.6 Pips Regular Bullish Divergence - exited late and lost several pips - trying to make up for the big loss yesterday I found the slower zerolag MACD to be too jumpy in it's signals with signals often coming way too early, so have replaced this with QQE(5) as it is smoother. Still using the fast zerolag MACD for divergences

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Jiva, When you talk of macd crosses, are you speaking of zero line crosses? Or are you talking of macd line crosses? Thanks, nice indicator... snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #287 ---
look for divergence on the fast zerolag 5,10,5 macd line crossing on the slow zerolag 12,24,9

--- 帖子 #288 ---
done for the day +15.9 watched a lot of good trades without taking them

--- 帖子 #289 ---
can you post QQE? Thanks....

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Oh, Maybe someone will see your request... and will code it... yes EA could be interesting..

--- 帖子 #291 ---
This is the qqe indi, I use it twice one at 5 and one at 30 although the same effect can be had by using 5 and waiting for crossing of 50 line (above 50 bullish, below 50 bearish), i just find with it twice it makes it easier when it "straddles" the 50

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Coding an alert on divergence would not really be applicable as divergence is only definite on the open of the 3rd bar after the divergence has occurred. the indicator currently shows the divergence earlier than this (basically as soon as there is a possibility that a fractal could be made), however this might then be invalidated and removed. In addition divergence itself is not a reason to trade, there has to be other factors to support it (other indis, trendline bounce etc) On all TF's divergences appear all over the place, and at best on their own they are only around 50% accurate.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Jiva When I got in this morning I made a trade on the gbp/usd on the 4 hour chart and went to bed. (I work nights) I just got up to check the trade out and I'am currently up $95.00 and still in the trade. tks snarlyjack

really bullish pattern

--- 帖子 #301 ---
You're right, the slow zerolag crosses too early... A cross of qqe 5 combined with divergence on zerolag 5,10,5 is good combination. Never under estimate support and resistance.... I lived through forex hell today due to some inattentiveness to support and resistance.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
That's it for today. +13.2 after all was said and done. I'm looking forward to using qqe. From the looks of things qqe may lend itself nicely to higher time frames. I want to experiment with qqe 5 a bit on the 15min chart.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
How do you get 7 vouchers when you trade with .03 lots ffs? lol what a joke.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Traders have a certain respectful attitude towards each other. They try to share what they may have learned. The voucher system helps to weed out those who may not have that same respectful attitude and cause disruptions. Vouchers means those you have worked with appreciate your efforts and attitude of working together.

Been watching this.. re-entry on continuation.. +3.9

--- 帖子 #309 ---
That's it for today +19.8 + 58.1 for the week ...... so far so good... the project is to build an account balance starting with $300, trading .01 lots per $100.. We get to $400 we go to .04 lots. In this way we just keep doing the same thing over and over again and don't worry about getting more pips per trade. We increase exponentially by increasing the size of the trade without taking on more risk. That's the idea anyway. staying focused is the big challenge...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Here's something I try to keep an eye out for. On the 15 minute the candles are very close to the pivot point (yellow line) They always, (99.99999%) of the time will go to the pivot when they are this close. So although there is a signal for long, I would not to take it. Even though there is usually a little bounce up before the drop. I wouldn't go short either.. since there is no signal short, even though I have seen this pattern so many times before. been watching this for a while. We got the little bounce and now slowly but surely the candles are headed for the pivot. I have to pack up for the day, but here's how it's progressed. Took a while, but it hit the pivot... and below...

R1 = 1.4641 Don't know if there is a way to compensate for gmt differences with this indi.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I'm using Daily Wood Pivots and they correspond to within 3 pips of: http://www.dailyfx.com/technical_analysis/pivot_points/ pete

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Sounds good. If mine are off I guess I must have compensated somehow. I'm so used to seeing them and how the candles respond to them that it seems to be working out, even if they may not correspond to another broker using a a different gmt. If it's working don't fix it..

--- 帖子 #331 ---
A lot of times a pop up like this is not really a breakout. It's stop hunting and limit order hunting by the brokers. One way to tell is to wait for a pull back and then see if the upside resumes. zero lag will give a divergent signal if it is simply brokers hunting for quick gains and not a serious breakout. This is very profitable for the brokers and they do it all the time. Most like that's what that pop was, brokers going shopping.. the divergence shows up on the 15 min. After the inital pop and pullback, it's gone higher..

--- 帖子 #332 ---
like yesterday, the candles eventually reached the pivot, today they will no doubt reach r2. The strategy for zerolag divergence is strictly defined so even though "I think" candles will reach r2, unless there is a signal i will not trade. This would have to be a whole different trading stategy, maybe "pivot, s and r".. Just for the heck of it, I placed the trade in another demo. Sure enough, after a pullback the candles jumped to r2. +17.6 I am seriously considering starting a second thread dedicated to the pivot s and r strategy. Will watch it for a while.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
not getting those nice clear signals, just waiting. Ben Banke speak later...

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Yes, pivots more often than not have a "magnetic" quality about them in a similar way to the troublesome 00 psyche-levels of which I am very cautious of trading around. Perhaps more credibility could be given to the attraction of price to R1, R2, S1, S2 etc once price has passed a mid -pivot level, dependent of course on price momentum. It may result in a larger pip count per trade... I will look into this... pete

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thinking about the difference in pivots and s and r.. The calculation is based on open and close hi and lo etc of the day candle. But the day candle will be slightly different for different gmt. Based on the day candle for the gmt the calculations will be correct for that gmt.

+15.7 That's it for the day. Building the account from $300 trading .03. .01 lot/$100. At $336. When it gets to $400 trade .04. Get $500 trade .05, etc.. Goal is to trade 10 standard lots. Doing the same trade over over and over again. Only the lot size to change. This is my live account. The 2 bad trades were actually good trades. It was very frustrating. The first small loss was cause by the infrared mouse closing the trade all by itself. I had the pointer on close and the table moved slightly. The mouse closed the trade. But it was a good trade. The 2nd loss, little bigger was caused when I couldn't close the trade. The server stalled. Very very frustrating. I closed mt4 and logged back in but by then the tide had turned. It was a good trade. So that is also part of scalping. Little technical difficulties from time to time.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
If at some point the lot size is significant, no reason why it should not become significant following this strategy, am wondering what affect that would have on filling the orders. A lot size of .03 for 2.9 pips is pretty easy to fill. But a lot size of 10 for 2.9 pips may be a different story. After all for a seller there has to be a buyer, and vice versa.. Of course there are all sorts of manipulations behind scenes. So it may be that the brokers themselves do the buying and selling without even trying to hunt up outside buyers and sellers, at least at that very second. Anyone know how this may play out?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
If you've ever seen level 2 data for a decent broker linked to a decent interbank market, then you'll know that filling and closing 10 standard lots in very little time should be no issue at all. Actually it's less than no issue at all. If it is, then you know you are with the wrong broker. Regards, JC

--- 帖子 #280 ---
When you trade non OTC Instruments like futures , and your able to see the Order Book with real volume data you could see that even in much less liquid markets, compared to EU FX, like the e-mini S&amp;P , filling 10,20 and even more contracts (Lots) isnt much of a problem . Of course its a problem for an fx market maker broker , but not for the market istelf , most times at least

Hi Jiva, I was searching for a zerolag MACD and came across your thread. Your strategy looks great and would like to test it out. I know it's an old thread, but if you are still around, would you by any chance have an updated version of the zerolag MACD that you can upload because it's not working on my MT4 platform. Thanks a million! Cheers!
