OKay here is one of the 4 best systems that I've made and used, with this system I pickup atleast 50 pips a day, I'm sharing this because I've learned so much from the people who actually share their systems and are not greedy, listen you don't need to be greedy there is enough money for everyone, atleast 2 trillion $ a day, so tell me if you like it. HERE IT IS FIrst of all I'm going to tell you on which currency/time/ and when to get out! Please read these carefully its very simple M30 = 30 minute, 1H = 1 hour low pips yes i know but I usually do 10 lots a trade 10 = $100 a pip, you do the math AUDJPY M30 15pip &lt;---- get out 15pip profit NZDUSD 1H 25pip USDCAD H1 20pip EURGBP H1 10pip USDJPY M30 15pip GBPUSD m30 20pip USDCHF M30 10pip EURCHF H1 15pip AUDUSD m30 10pip EURJPY m30 15pip CHFJPY 1H 15pip CADJPY m30 20pip EURUSD m30 15pip ***************** THE POURIA METHOD period: 85 method: (linear Weight) apply to: (low) color: red period: 75 method: (linear weight) apply to: (low) color: red period: 5 method: (expodential) apply to: (close) color: yellow MACD FAST EMA:15 SLow EMA: 26 MACD SMA: 1 ******************************************** SHORT: when the yellow line crosses the 2 red lines downward and get the confirmation from the MACD it has to be downward too LONG: when the yellow line crosses the 2 red lines upward and get the confirmation from the MACD it has to be upward too STOP LOSS: 14 pips the most &lt;--- I doubt if there is any loss ENJOY THE MONEY YOU MAKE!!!

?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I dont understand how the system exactly works...

--- 帖子 #4 ---
read under it sorry I forgot to actually explain how i edited it

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Any suggestions for stop losses on the various currency pairs?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
thanks for sharing your system but do u have any diagrams to show? whats the chances of success? drawdowns?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
14 the most

--- 帖子 #8 ---
98% success, just go ahead and try it out on demo

--- 帖子 #9 ---
sorry abt asking but what abt the stop loss,any? if i may asked whats the worst drawdown with this system? thanks!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Why such small take profits? I'm looking at this system on USDJPY and for many trades there is a lot more profit potential than just 15 pips.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi forexpert310 and thanks for the effort. Am I right to assume that 5 EMA is set to close?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
yes there is more profit potential but YOU DONT WANT TO RISK IT! thats why its 98% accurate if you get out on 10 to 15 pips

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Just load the boat ...and don't be greedy? .....ha ? Sounds good!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
sottiro yes its to close

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks. I'll start forward testing on Monday and let you know how it goes.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Are you adding broker spread fees?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
great!!! let me know,

--- 帖子 #18 ---
i got your point now! thanks! i am gonna test it out but do u mind if i ask your system r tested on demo or live acct? thanks!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
u2da, no the spreads fees are your problem ! just go big lots and you wouldnt care

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hello Expert, also a short question: When do you open a position - on close of candle or just at cross of the ma's? Thanks for sharing Freewheelin

--- 帖子 #21 ---
.......... thats what I thought! And which Pairs seem to be more consistant? I personally like trading GBP/JPY - GBP/USD

--- 帖子 #22 ---
at the cross and yea LIVE ACCOUNT

--- 帖子 #23 ---
just open up those 12 currencies and start pumping BABY!!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
thanks and good day!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Only problem some brokers charge 10 pips a trade ... If its not one of the Majors. ....... or who is your broker?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
5 EMA apply to: close the system works fine, i think you did something wrong please check again

--- 帖子 #27 ---
EFX 1-2 spreads

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks .... although I prefer MT4 Broker

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Yes sorry man. My bad. I even deleted the post. The problem was with my MACD settings. Thanks. Semms promising.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
are all the pairs consistenly : producing for u at least 10pips? thanks!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Forexpert, Thanks for sharing your system with us. Can you please elaborate a little bit more about how the MACD exactly should support out decision to enter / exit a trade ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #32 ---
yes check the history

--- 帖子 #33 ---
if the MACD is upsite down and the yellow EMA crossed the red MA go short

--- 帖子 #34 ---
How about stop losses?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
there isnt going to be any loss, dont worry about it

--- 帖子 #36 ---
could work but in some cases your money can turn into loss, or 0

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I deleted my previous post before i saw that you already answered me. After re-thinking on it, what i said about using the MACD re-cross as an exit signal was a complete nonsense..

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Forex, Thanks a lot for sharing this method... Just a quick question or two Does the MACD have to be Below &amp; Above Zero or just trending (pointing) up/down? Approximately how many crosses do you get per day, and how long are you monitoring the charts?? Looks like a very good system for an EA!! D.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
below 0 = down

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I just checked EURUSD ang GBPUSD and for the past 3 weeks there is at most 60% success rate, do you have other filters , like dont trade at particular time or during news announcements?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
this system works pretty well, it picks up on things a bit late at times. Might i suggest employing candlestick charting techniques along with this method. This way you can catch the directionals and the reverses as well. Just another way of the system double checking itself.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
your not doing it right you have to look at the MACD too and also 10-15pip!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Nice System should be a great strategy to converted into an EA. But I have a question though, does the signal require to be in order? example: 1) MACD down then 2) EMA cross. or opposite order? Or are trades taken as long as the two indicators agree? Im asking because Im looking to convert this into an EA. Regards, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #44 ---
When would you enter? After candle close or immediately when you see the cross?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This thread s hilarious

--- 帖子 #46 ---
here we come ..... who wants to make an EA for this? I checked this and it works!!!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
EA?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Ill do it! but need some more info. here are the things i need to know before I start working on this. 1) does the signals have to come in any order? or just enter as long as EMA on MACD agree? 2) do we need to wait for candle to close or open order as soon as there is cross? 3) Do we take into consideration the broker spread for TP SL levels? or just leave it to lady luck? I like the system. very easy to code with high win rate Regards, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #49 ---
cross is good enough, macd and cross &lt;-- both have to accure doesnt have to be at the same time,

--- 帖子 #50 ---
A trading robot.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
usually cross comes first then MACD

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Great thanks for the quick reply. Ill have the Pouria EA v1 ready very soon. -Mikhail

--- 帖子 #53 ---
It seems like we are going to have a SELL signal for AUD / USD in a few minutes.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
You won't forget to insert the alert function will you.....lol

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Xerof you forgot about the SMS alert and email alert and fax alert.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
No Problem, how would you like the alarm to sound? should it be *bling* you want it *toink* LOL No worries Ill put an alarm. -Mikhail

--- 帖子 #57 ---
What do you want alerts for? It's an EA...it trades itself... Lux

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Ah, the famous last words. Actually, it sounds interesting, I'll try it out.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I will be eagerly enticipating the arrival of the EA~ I would like a copy ..... thanks a Mil. for the offer!!! I really can't wait fot this EA ... as I am convinced it would work.....very well! Just make so the tp can be changed for dif. pairs. Thank You!!!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Forexpert, one more: the MACD confirms not with its trend, only where the line is? Below zero go short ? Above zero go long ? No matter which direction it shows? Thanks again

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Could you also have ..... Risk ... Money Management included? Thanks!!! This thread .............is smokin ..............!!!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
No Problem mate. I have a favor to ask though. I see you backtested this manually right. Did you take into consideration the spread? since MT4 spreads can go as high as 10 pips. What would the win rate be with such a high spread according to your backtest? -Mikhail

--- 帖子 #63 ---
C'mon peeps, 60 posts already and no suggestions for "improvements" yet.... Well, here's the first one then..... Enter 2 lots (whatever size suits your capital/risk profile), take t/p at the levels suggested on lot 1, move s/l to b/e on lot 2, and run it...........use your own exit techniques to exit..... A quick eyeballing of a few charts suggests this system has a nice habit of getting in on some reasonable trend moves on more than the odd occasion

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Someone please post some charts when to take trade? Enter only when it crossess? what if it already crossed and stays above or below? thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I checked GBP/USD [1hr chart] and it looked good although you get a few signals where you would lose considering the spread. At the same time loses were not so frequent and I tend to think going for more pips would be beneficial. I will do more manual testing later on more pairs. I would just put it together so the parameters can be tweaked to individual taste. If we mostly traded mostly the majors spread would not be as much usually anyway. Thanks so very much!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
A smoke signal alert would be great in case the power goes out... D.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
hi there,i just tried your system on Aud/Usd and apparently it failed me! i lost ard 12 pips.just wanna clarify something-do i buy/sell when the candlesticks crosses over the 2 red lines or waiting for the yellow line to cross both red lines? thanks

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks for sharing your system, sounds and looks interesting. Dave

--- 帖子 #69 ---
According to what Forexpert said in an ealier post, you have to wait for the yellow line to cross the red lines. At the AUD/USD - the yellow line did not cross.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I looked at the eur/Usd, great on the crossing.we can get some more pips with s/r, fibs, mm etc. I think we're on to a great strategy. Thanks

--- 帖子 #71 ---
thanks for the clarification 4xMaster! now i know my mistakes,i will continue to test out the strategy!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Forexpert Loving your work here - thanks for sharing! On post 1 you mentioned this is only 1 of the 4 best systems you have. Will you be sharing your other systems with us too? (on another thread - don't want to distract this one!) I certainly hope so! All the best Jason

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks so much Forexpert - this truly is a simple trade to follow on an uncluttered chart. Very generous on your part to share your time consuming research.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
your right, proper use s/r can definitely increase pips collection

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi Forexpert310, Thanks for sharing your system. Do you have any guidelines on re-entry ? cheers.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Mikhail, Thanks for programming this. Forexpert....thanks for sharing. I am ready to check it out. Let us know when the EA is ready. For MT4 right?/!! Thanks Guys, BP

--- 帖子 #77 ---
This EA is perfect for that.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
mikhaeldgreat, can you please ad trailing stop option in your EA as well? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Forexpert, Thanks for this system. How long have you been trading with it?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
hi guys excellent trading strategy. i'll continue testing it and i'll post my results later. i have an idea for the exit of the econd lot. exit the second lot if a candle CLOSES below the 5 EMA in a long position and higher that the 5 EMA in a short position. tell me what you think of the idea.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
hi nicolas,i am beginning to like this place v much!! everyone seem to contribute to a better trading strategies,bravo! by the way,can i ask if u mean the candles have to be above the 5 ema for short and below for long position completely or just partially? thanks!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
So, the first dotted line = loss second dotted line = loss third dotted line = win fourth dotted line = win Looks like break-even. If your using the MACD for direction which could be the slope, hist value, signal line slope, then you might need 'something else' to confirm. Unless I'm seeing this wrong...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Forexpert310, Thanks for the post. Not sure what do you mean by linear weight. Is this Weighted average or Simple Moving average. Thanks

--- 帖子 #84 ---
actually the candle must close under the 5 EMA for long position. and if you are in a big profit (80 PIP or so) you can wait for a second candle to close under the 5 EMA before you close the second lot. you might be risking about 10 or 15 PIPs of your profits but you will have a bigger chance that the trend will continue in your favor. good luck

--- 帖子 #85 ---
hi thank you very much for your system i've just made first 15 pips with the eurousd LIVE account. it's great system simon

--- 帖子 #86 ---
you might break even one day but other days you are winning. so don't panic and let your test be for several months,

--- 帖子 #87 ---
well if you have traded the next one you would have been in profit by noe

--- 帖子 #88 ---
TradeStar- When you attach a Moving Average in MT4, you can select the "MA Method" of Linear Weighted instead of Simple (SMA), exponential (EMA) etc. Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
thanks for your advise! i guess i am not experienced enough....well,learning is a life long process.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you for this system I also did 15 pips on live with Euro. Really hope you will share another 3 systems with us. Peter

--- 帖子 #91 ---
To get your 50pips a day, do you need to trade all pairs? I looks like some pairs do not show possible trades every day. Thanks!!! BP

--- 帖子 #92 ---
IM HAPPY THAT YOU GUYS ARE LOVING MY SYSTEM, i posted the get out pip for a reason thats why in some pairs you might see 10-15 pip prof only

--- 帖子 #93 ---
yes trade all pairs OWN FOREX!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
While manual backtesting is by no means perfect, I like to practice the exercise as it gets me comfortable with the system's concepts. Here are the results I did for Jan 3 to today on the GBP/USD: I've attached an MT4 template so you can upload to see the trades (green line = positive trade, red line = neg. trade). Total Pips = +290 My reentry was at the presence of the next opposite signal. Ex. If the most current signal was LONG (MACD &gt; 0, and 5MA above 75MA &amp; 85MA) then I wouldn't reenter until a SHORT signal presented itself. When/if an EA comes around, then we can backtest further date ranges with greater accuracy (I'm human and prone to errors of course). 3-Jan Short 20 8-Jan Long -15 8-Jan Long 20 1 0-Jan Short 20 10-Jan Long 20 10-Jan Short 20 11-Jan Long 20 16-Jan Short 20 17-Jan Long 20 18-Jan Short 20 18-Jan Long 20 19-Jan Short 20 19-Jan Long -15 22-Jan Long -15 24-Jan Short 20 25-Jan Long 20 25-Jan Short 20 29-Jan Long 20 31-Jan Short 20 31-Jan Long -15 2-Feb Short 20 6-Feb Long -15 6-Feb Short -15 6-Feb Long 20 8-Feb Short 20

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thank you, Nitro. Was spread factored in?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Nitro4x, Thanks for backtesting that pair!! I know how it is to manually backtest. So, at first I was a little disheartened cause it did not equal "50 pips a day", but then I realized it was only one pair...and there are like 12 others there to use as well. Talk to you later. BP

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I've been looking at this method on a few different pairs and I have to say that the win rate is nowhere near 98%. Do you have any backtest results to support that number?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
No problem...I did NOT factor in spread on this backtest exercise, but there only 2-3 positions from what I could see that would have been affected (meaning the TP level just topped 23 PIPS then retraced...assuming a 3 pip spread on GBP during normal market conditions). Another note, there are SEVERAL trades that the trend continues and MANY pips are not taken, so proper money mgmt on this system *might* help (3-4 trades where a trailing 30 SL would have resulted in 60ish+ PIPS).

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I know the feeling, but believe me a good strategy that earns 15-25 pips with a high % rate can keep you comfortable (not saying this system is it). I eyeballed about 6 of the pairs to see the activity of the cross/MACD signal and obviously some are more active than others. It looks promising, but without further backtesting and more importantly forward testing, we'll have to wait and see.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Yeah, I tested it too and its only about 97.5% acurate. Oh well, I'll just wait for something better...for free.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
HAHA!!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Jamdown....that was just terrible!! lol...but it was funny. BP

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Eyeballing Cable, it looks like for the last week the 1HR chart had slightly better sucess than the 30min. I don't know if this is an outlier or if it is a better chart. Eyeballing it, I like it so far. My most prized moves always seem to come back to Moving Averages. I don't know if you invented this, tweaked something existing, or what, but everytime I think I find something on my own, doesn't work exactly right. Eyeballing NZD/USD form mid-january is a big wow too. Not bad.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
nitro4x It looks nice promising .......... but a couple of things ....... --&gt; Are you adding spreads ? This is very important! Some are charged 10 pips ...... --&gt; are you only taking trades when the Averages Cross &amp; the MACD line up exactly or are you allowing one or two candles for the MACD to come in line? --&gt; You have to manually ..... drop down the vertical lines ...... otherwise it looks pretty ..... but pretty .... and actual are not the same. --&gt; Pouria looks good ..... but forward testing .... will tell it all .... I noticed that you have to allow one candle beyond the cross to be sure .... its real and not just .... pretty. Conclusions on my manual back teasting on GBP/JPY ..... I think this would trade quite profitably .... but it is not the Holy Grail. It on first glance appears to be .... but I don't think that it is. The EA will help us to back test quicker and better and ...... and I am anxiously anticipating its arrival any day now. mikhaildgreat is working on the EA. IMO

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I did not factor in spreads on my backtesting the cable (2-3 pip avg spread for me). This is indeed important, I just wanted to do a quick exercise to test it's potential (on a very short period, I know) I took trades at the open of the next candle after the MACD and MA cross signal was present. Not perfect, but without tick data for EA testing, or forward testing, it's the best I can do. I agree about the candle after the signal ...that's why I tested at the open of the candle after the signal was present. More important that it's forward tested because "real" and "pretty" are definitely different....I hope to find the "real pretty" one

--- 帖子 #107 ---
We are about to have a cross on USD/CAN...good opp to try...lets see...

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I had open trade at 1821. Hope it will go south.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
wait for the next candle

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I was too fast... hups

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Something to consider for the big bonus pips ! Look at your 30min chart for the GBP/USD for the 10 Jan 07. The first signal was a LONG (risky trade as you where at a 50% fib retrace level from the previous days high. Also the 75 moving average had crossed to the down side, bearish). The second signal was a SHORT. You have various reasons for price not to go up and now you have a valid signal to short. This is bonus pips time ! The ADR for the GBP/USD is over 100pips. You have a very good idea where the high for the day is, so all you need to do now is count 100pips down from the top and that is your target. You should have made about 50pips on this trade. Today would have been about 60 pips ! [use standard macd settings, more useful info when you learn it's patterns with this system].

--- 帖子 #112 ---
did you short with real money?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
How long would these trades take? Being that the next candle would be at 4pm, coming up to that deadzone before Asian, especially being USD/CAD. MAC-D IS negative -.0001, Yellow line is 1 pip below RED EMA, and is touching the other EMA(1.1833). I wonder if 1.1811-ish is a support too. But if the MA crossovers are that powerful, must be irrelevant.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
2-3 hours

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Why do we wait for the next candle? So if it crosses this hour dont take it? This is a new rule? Explain please.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
no its not a new rule, its just safer specially for usd/cad because if you look closely look how fast the candles were moving south obviously it was safer to wait for the next candle because of the trend

--- 帖子 #117 ---
My yellow line just crossed when the price gets below 1.1822. But if it retraces back to 24 I bet it uncrosses. Was a pretty big trend. ANd that's going to be an ugly candle is it closes exactly like that, with volume drop off....

--- 帖子 #118 ---
yes with micro account.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
...hand on the sword...waiting the right moment to unsheathing... patience is a virtue....not a sign of weakness petvel1985...next time just breath deeper and calm down....

--- 帖子 #120 ---
yes i will. i am bit excited. are you going to open now?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I think I'll do, just 5 min to next candle...

--- 帖子 #122 ---
ok lets try it again

--- 帖子 #123 ---
lol...you guys are great. Thanks for all the info...this is good stuff. Good dialogue. BP

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Took at demo trade SHORT on USD/CAD at 1.1824 since the signals were present on the previously closed candle. TP = 1.1800 (20 PIPS + 4 pip spread) SL = 1.1839 (15 PIPS)

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I'm with you on this trade! same numbers

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I am there also. hopefully now right. Open 1823

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I am in, 1.1824 same TP and SL I love this game....

--- 帖子 #128 ---
This is similar to a "system" I looked at a few years ago. Here's the problem when you try to cross a 5 and a 75 on a 30M and/or 1HR (ESPECIALLY with the 4 majors): It looks nice on the past charts but most of the moves come during news time. By the time the 5 crosses the 75, the price is already (usually) moving back in the opposite direction. Most of the entries posted would've gotten you in AFTER the price started moving back the other way. Looks nice though.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
FYI: I'm reading that the [HOURLY] range for USD/CAD between now and the next 6 hours is only 10 to 15 pips. For those of you in the trade right now.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Have you noticed the support at 1.1819?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I just manually backtested USD/CHF from 1st of january till today Stop loss is 14 pips if take profit 10 pips then 14 winners -6 losers = 56pips if take profit is 20 then 12 winners -8 losers = 128 pips there was one trade where stop was 1 pip away from triggering i dont know what would really happen in this situation, i mean with different broker you could have different outcome. and yeah spread of 4 pips is included in calculations BTW i joined you guys for USDCAD short at 24 just now

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Just done the same for EURUSD from 1 jan till today. 25 trades in total, 14 pips stop if take profit was 15 then 20 winners - 5losers = +230 pips if take profit was 20 pips 18 winners - 7 losers = +249 pips if take profit was 25 pips 17 winners - 8 losers = +313 There were 2 trades that came within 1 pips of stop so i took one as a loss and one as a profit again dues to different brokers, i took sprad as 2 pips and another thing there was one iffy trade which would result in 15 and 20 pip profit but may have not resulted in 25 pips profit but a 14 pips loss so if you subtract 39 pips from the total of 313 you still have 274

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Anyone else trying out the canada trade....she won't go down!!!! She's just hovering...can't wait till it hits 1800. See ya, BP

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks guys for your contribution. Can anybody build a simple indicator for this system that shows an arrow when there is a valid signal as well as a sound alert? Since we have many pairs, thats gonna help us a lot. Appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Ok last set of results for tonight, just did EURJPY 30min, stop 14, spread i used as 2 pips as is the case with my broker, this has been the worst performer so far. Total 25 trades when TP = 15pips 14 winner - 11 loosers=+56 when TP= 20 12 winners - 13 lossers= +58 when tp=25 12 winners-13 losers = +118 when tp = 30 11 winners - 14 loosers = +104

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Lexazver, Thanks for all the work. Good results to look at and ponder. BP

--- 帖子 #137 ---
great job on posting your BT results. A few observations stick out in my mind...(1) profitable across multiple currencies, (2) while not 95% win ratio, the risk/reward ratio is enough to result in positive pips, and (3) there's room to use money mgmt to gain more pips as your results show.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
forexpert310, Are you using MT as your charting application to get your signals? And if so, what datafeed are you using? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
So, lets say this canadian trade hits the SL...which it looks like it might do...but in doing so it breaks through the 2 red lines again.... Does that then signal a buy? BP

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I set this indicator for 5 and 75 as well as 5 and 85. It seems to work, but perhaps it can be modified for the LMA's (not sure if it makes a difference) and sound by one of our great programmers?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
BTW, what do you do in this situation? This is from Jan 11 on 30 min euro. All 3 of these trades would have been losses, correct?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thanks Sudfyre, Thats a great start! I am sure one of our programmers can modify this for LMA and also a sound alert and bigger arrows as well as taking MACD to account. amin1000

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Prior to reading and back testing this system I was working on a EMA system with the FX_FISH indicator. I use the FX_FISH as a momentum and trend indicator as it can give you a nice early warning to MA crossovers. WARNING: FX_FISH repaints itself so you cannot look at the latest 4 or 5 bars as an exact reading as they adjust with the volatility of the current price. This is an indicator you have to get a feel for live. Having said that, the FX_FISH indicator does give you a very nice idea of where the trend is headed and how much strength is left in the current trend. If you practice with it, you will find it will give you early warnings of trend changes quite nicely when taking into account MA crosses and the MACD position above or below zero. Especially the MACD. Whatever you do, do not rely on the current bar colour as an indicator as it will change. Look at the forest, not the tree. For example....I already made my 20 pips in the latest USDCAD trade. I opened my USDCAD trade at 1846 (2007-02-08 20:00 GMT) and got out at 1826 (actually 1821 with spread) at 23:00 GMT. The FX_FISH was established down, the MACD established down and the MA headed down rather steeply. It's something to try and play with.

On my chart, the MACD only crosses zero once on the way up at the last MA crossover. As well with FX_FISH you would see a solid uptrend.

Even if it hits the stoploss, you'd think a short would be safe. It's coming off a top, and it looks like a flag or pennant(I get them mixed up) consolidating on the 1hr. The stochastics are rediculously oversold though. But only on the 1H chart, the rest says we're getting overbought or heading down...

Arrgghh...stopped out. Oh well...lets look for the next one!! BP

The 5 EMA has crossed the 75 &amp; 85 LMA's, and the MACD is almost at 0. Could be a trade on next 30min candle

I'm still alive on CAD (3 pips short of SL) with GBP/JPY in sight...

Thanks Forexpert! Nice cross system! A suggestion for Mikhaildgreat, perhaps a minimum distance for the 5 to move from the other 2 MAs as a confirmation as opposed to another bar or time thing. Thank you both for your efforts! J.P.

as in any system .... but maybe not a WIPE out ...... I would believe this is what forexpert310 .... meant. There will certainly be small loses as in any Method!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
You've summed it up perfectly. Unless it happens to catch a strong trend, it is too lagging and the move will be over by the time of entry. Nice post

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Could be..... BUT..... the EUR/USD is getting ready to cross around Londons open and no News Events are scheduled or Clear Trends are present. I guess that's what forward testing is all about. We'll see. J.P.

ok i have now eur/USD short from 1.3001 TP 1.2981 SL 1.3015 and i have AUD/USD short from 0.7795 TP 0.7785 SL 0.7809 anyone have the same numbers ?

i just won one on GBP/JPY. great system got 15 PIPs

Forexpert, Don't let a few folks ruffle feathers. I LOVE this forum but, most on here take every word too literally. You can tell by the lengthy discussions of when is market open and before or after candle closes or ... It takes some guts and thick skin to post your thoughts and methods but the benefit is some valid forward testing by many and the very useful observations and insights of some great traders, so keep up the good work and by all means feel free to share what you have. It WILL come back to you usually in the form of a better system than you started with. Thanks! Also in regards to my last post, Good point that News Events can certainly skew backtest results and something to keep in mind. Good Luck J.P.

I agree....thank you very much for introducing your trading system. I really understand behaviour of these people provking and insulting others that are just trying to help.... if not interested by something, just pass your way ....

--- 帖子 #163 ---
well, we'll see how it play out so far it been max +7 and now it is in the red.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hello, First of all expert, I thank you for sharing your system, it seems very promising specifically for my time of trading. Now to all of those who are talking about news skewing backtesting results, perhaps I'm not understanding you correctly, but I just backtested January through May of 2005 (EUR/USD). My backtesting was based on candle closing, stoploss of 15 and take profit of 15. Since I am basing the backtesting on candle close (and entry on next candle open), I don't see how the results could be incorrect due to any factors, including the line crossing over then crossing back again. If I am mistaken, I'd appreciate a correction. Here are the results of my backtesting: January 21-win 7 losers (3 of which I would have eliminated due to discrimination, but I wanted to trade the system just as it is) February 12-win 7 losers March 14-win 2 losses April 11-win 3 losses May 19-win 4 losses Total wins: 56 Total losses: 16 Win%:77 Maximum # of consecutive losses: 3 I chose 2005, because for different systems that I've backtested, it was tough, especially in the beginning. Now 77% might not seem much to you, but from personal backtesting experience (like with forex tester, not just visually) it is very high. Especially when you consider the amount of time you need to prepare for and take in each trade. Also, do consider that this is only on one pair. If this system works as backtested, and I see no reason that it would not (since my backtesting was based on candle close, and therefore isn't up to market fluctuation to change history of ma cross), I believe it is a simple, highly profitable (for those with the money management to capitalize on successive wins and high accuracy), and a very time-friendly system to use. So thank you again ForexExpert, and I have two questions for you, if you don't mind me asking: A- from your experience, what are some of the nuances and difficulties that you encountered? Any technical details like avoiding news, etc.? B- Out of the pairs, which have been the most consistently profitable? And finally, I and I am sure many other beginners like myself would be utterly grateful if you shared the remaining 3 systems, as you seem to have a good eye for this one. Again, thank you. Yours in Spirit. EDIT: I thought I backtested 2005, but its actually 06. Mistook the dates.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
By scrolling back you can see it frequently pulls back for a while then finally moves again. Forexpert, am I right in guessing that maybe a 1/3 of trades you are in for a couple of hours to get the 15-20 pips? The way I'm seeing it a good place for SL might be just past the last round # beyond the slow pair as opposed to a fixed amount. Any thoughts? J.P.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hello All, I see you all are trying to backtest this strategy. Anyways this may help i attched below the strategy tester report testing EURUSD from Jan1 till today. I havnt optimized it yet but I found that 14 SL is too tight, at least for an EA. Anyways this test was done with 30TP and 20SL I will release the Pouria EA Beta later today. Regards, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #167 ---
this is the fastest thread to reach more than 10, 000 views in 1.5 days. amazing stuff, forexexpert, by the time you release other strategies, ff will be dedicated to you. thanks though.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Masterblue, Sorry, I didn't mean to say that any backtests were flawed but that news releases frequently cause spikes and retracements that effect 30min &amp; 1hr candles (could even be the cause of some of the losers) so let's be mindful of this as we forward test. Thanks for your effort and for posting your backtest results .... Quite encouraging! J.P.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
So it looks like while I was sleeping, the Euro/USD would have triggered a sell and would have TP'd....wait, how about this...this is what I saw since yesterday and the call of the CAN short...I am only watching about 8 pairs right now...hard without an EA Can short...stopped out - 20pips Euro/USD - short - allowed to close out- +15pops NZD/USD - short - allowed to close out- +25 Can/USD - crossed for a buy, but looks like MACD did not confirm.... Can anyone else confirm these trades/thoughts? The only one I actually took was the loosing Canada trade....was asleep through these others....but if I would have taken these, I would be +20 pips right now. Looks awesome!! Please comment!! BP

--- 帖子 #170 ---
It's a great method, i think if we combine with a good money management... it's a great method in forex... It's not a "holy grail" system but the probability of success is very high... thanks forexpert ... ...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I also did some EA backtesting for EURUSD for 2007. Target: 20 Pips - Spread: 18 Pips SL: 14 Pips + Spread: 16 Pips Timeframe: 30M Only crosses with immediate MACD confirmation. Attached you find the results and the chart with entries/exits.

Sorry, missed this post

--- 帖子 #176 ---
This seemingly very profitable system by Expert and having to make an EA by our great Mikhaildgreat is like a marriage in heaven, don't you think so? There's just a never ending supply of wonderful systems here. Have you guys noticed that after the 5EMA crosses, most of the pairs will trend in that direction. Sorry for diverting away from this wonderful method but I can't seem to keep my eyes on those trends the pairs made after the crosses. And when it trends, one will definitely get to increase their profits many times over. So, may I suggest this to mikhaildgreat to add this option into the ea: 1) open with 2 units 2) after hitting the TP level for the various pairs, sell off 1 unit (as per the method) 3) at the same time move the other unit's SL to breakeven 4) if profit increases another 10 pips, move SL to +10 pips 5) if profit still increases another 20 pips, move SL another +20 pips Hope I'm adding something good into this promising method.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I absolutly agree with your idea, cause I see most of time after cross the pair keep going same direccion, so I thought I was not going to take profits as indicated, but your method in much safer. What I dont know is if there is a chance to program this, I am not a programmer and I have no idea whether this is easy or just imposible. lets see what our expert programmer have to say...

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hello the truth is we are still not sure wether the original method will really work! So lets first see if it really works before we try to improve it. But I encourage you to keep them brain juice flowing. -Mikhail

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Not to be rude... But cant figur out,,whats different by this system..than any other.. Macd/ema/sma crossing systems... Maby some can explain..

--- 帖子 #180 ---
The difference is time frame, mm, tp

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I wonder what would happen if we do not take loss until we got a reverse signal. For instance: yesterday night we got SL on CAN but we never got a reverse signal, so if we didn't set SL, now we would be making profit....On the other hand, if we get a reverse signal, then we take the loss and enter the market the other way...I don't know if I am clear enough... Just a thought Hope it'd be useful

--- 帖子 #182 ---

It looked as if the cross was not a solid one. I can see where when it had a solid cross it took off. Maybe we need to wait for another candle before you actually get in the trade or will it be too late then. AH, the 2 edged sword again. There is always one in every strategy. I know that I would not have traded those 2 other crosses personally.

i like to enquire fr u guys if anyone of u have actually tried on live acct,besides forexexpert310 of course.i understand that its abit different when u r trading live and on demo,care to share guys? what exactly are u thinking when u r trading live or demo? thanks alot....

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi, i already started live trading this method (micro lots), but i make a little adjustment, for example for SL i set 14+spread. and primarily taking profits using s/r. today( friday ) i open two trade, aud/usd and eur/usd. already close aud/usd with (+14 pips) could get way more but since this method still new to me so better play it save and i rarely trade this particular currency before. as for eur/usd still open.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
thanks for your input but what abt the mental part? thanks

--- 帖子 #197 ---
On what TF did you see the crossing ?coz on the 30min as recommended by forexexpert310 there's non i.e on the EUR/JYP

Hey fxnewbie71! This week my profits came from usd/jpy, eur/jpy, eur/chf anf gbp/usd. I have the system open in all of my charts... but the best reults are with the trending currencies rather than range-bound pairs! Happy Trading!

Hi ericoco, at that time the bar was in the middle of the channel. It didn't cross though...

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hey no problem..uhh... I'm as relaxed as one can be (I wouldn't be human, if there wasn't any anxiety and doubt in my trading). I use a very strict money management strategy and a decent trading strategy.... that's really all you can ask for in this business. My money management strategy is what makes me profitable.. not my trading strategy per se... however, this system works excellently with the way I trade... "half kelly" money management, and adding to my position as account size increases (basically).

--- 帖子 #204 ---
possible GBP/JPY long... fueled by profit taking... hopefully this can run until the end of the session!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
just follow the rule, thats all. try don't get emotional with the decision. As for me, i'm only do manual trading, no EA's for me since i don't feel really comfortable with it. I notice that an EA is currently being develop just wondering does anybody develop indicator (that make noise when the ema's cross) for this method ? and one thing, what is the time frame for trading gbp/jpy?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
GBP/JPY on a 30min works.

--- 帖子 #207 ---

Hi mwilkinw Did MACD confirm your trade? I don't see that on my chart... Thanks. Gab

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi mwilkinw can you please explain a bit more how works half kelly money management? thank you Peter

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hey TraderGab! I take the trades as long as the MACD is moving in the direction of the 5EMA when it crosses... I don't wait until it crosses 0. I also have it on my system.. so I usually take the trade on the alert... I just don't exit on the alert and I use strict money management... so I use the system as an entry indicator everything else is all TRADER!! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hey Peter, I just wrote about it here check it out: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=47

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I waited for MACD confirm and took the trade a couple of minutes ago at 237.20 may I ask what stop you are going to use?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hey Forex1man hopefully we'll see some profit on this trade... My initial stop is 30pips below entry, then once the trade is profitable, I make a judgement call to move the stop 2 pips on the oppsoite side of the MA's... the averages usually become support for a longer trend... so rather than using a trailing stop I'll scale in and out of the trade.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
hello everyone just wanted to say, I'm glad that this system is working for you guys, My Pouria Method II will come out soon after this method gets out completely so standby I'm doing this to own the banks/big investors, they've taken enough money from people

Nice to hear from you and thanks your system looks fine if so far and is greatly appreciated, looking forward to see what else your are trading. Thanks again

It looks like we may have to hold this trade or cut before the close if we don't have some movement in the next hour. I'll probably hold.

Since it is the time of day and Friday closing I took profits 50% profits on this trade at 10 pips and moved stop loss to break even on remaining lots.

I just cobbled this together. Should work OK. Enjoy. Lux UPDATED with angle feature.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi Luxinterior, Can you explain the startMACDshift 6 and the endMACDshift 0.Can you add a buy alert and a sell alert..Great job on the indicator..Thanks

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Those two variables are used to calculate the angle of the MACD. Default is from current bar back 6 bars. You can decide how many bars to go back to calculate the angle/slope. From my understanding and by checking over historical data it's the angle of the macd that is of importance and not so much whether it's above/below the zero line. Above/below the zero will happen as a by product of the angle so it's almost irrelevant. As for a buy/sell alert that's pretty much what you get with the cross alert. It's up to you if you take the signal or not. I'd suggest a cross signal combined with the angle of the macd. Experiment and decide what combination suits. Regards Lux PS: I've updated the indicator so it's pretty much an all in one deal. Just put it on an empty chart and enjoy. There's no MACD showing as I mentioned above I don't believe it's of much use. If you really want it on the screen just add it manually as before.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks very much.I will check it out.Best regards

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Thanks, nice job this will make watching a lot of charts easier. The angle concept will be nice once you have tested it against the crossing the zero line by watching it a few times. This forum is a great place to share ideas and thouhts and learn from new concepts, again thanks for the indicator.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Any reason you chose to set fast moving average to 6 rather then 5 ? I understand it can be changed.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Simple accident. I'll change and re upload now. Lux

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi, thank you for coding this nice indicator. However, I noticed that when I attach the indicator to my template that the EMA5 is shifted 1 bar to the right when you compareit to my manually added EMA5. The 2 WMAs are identical. Is it only me?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Wow, looking back over the charts with your arrows in place you can now see a lot of losing trades. I do notice a few of the losing trades would not have happened if you was also watching the MACD, but still kind of scary !!!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I think you were using it with the default at 6 as spotted earlier. I've reupped it with it set to 5. My mistake. I've also noted that in a few instances the signals are not always triggered but this is very rare and is a limitation of the method. I ma5 set on open etc etc. Changing it fixes the one signal but causes others to fail so I think it's best to stick with the original settings and just accept that on rare occasions you might miss a signal. Lux

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I should have clarified that a little I was looking at gbp 30 min chart still quite a few losers but on other hand EUR chart looks quite well. Oh, well enough till Sunday night thanks again, have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hello, Your indicator is helpful, however it is not accurate. The entry is sometimes too late due to it opening after a candle where the cross occured with high momentum happened. It also plots entries when one, and not both of the lines are crossed.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
No, unfortunately not. I had already the newest version and just downloaded it again. Still the same, the EMA 5 is shifted 1 bar to the right from my manual EMA5.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Sorry Dan. I was applying it to the open not the close I've been at this a while and my eyes are starting to blur Fixed it now and also done ANOTHER update - The last I promise...for now! With this one you can specify the maximum/minimum angle you're interested in seeing signals for. So for instance if you set it to 2 you'll only be given signals if the MACD is +/- 2 when crossing the MA's...It certainly makes for some pretty accurate signals looking back at the charts. Obviously each pair is different so you'll have to play with the settings to get the optimum ones but I've given plenty of options so go WILD! If you find any killer settings please post them for all to enjoy. Lux

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Awesome, now it fits perfectly Whre can I switch the new angle settings? I cant seem to find it in the indicator settings. And take a rest ow,hehe. Weekend is long enough to get this right.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
And one thing I cant make sense of is: Why are the WMA`s applied to the low? Does it make sense at all? As far as I can think, crosses for shorts are later than and crosses for long are earlier than compared to if you would apply it to close or even typical. Do I make sense here?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Dan - I was following the original strategy. I changed it to typical and i quite like the results. I also added a visual for stop loss and take profit that is quite neat. I wouldn't take them as gospel but they make looking back at past history and trying to find optimum settings a bit easier. Lux PS: I've also added 2 variables so you can select your own price mode that each MA is applied to. 0:CLOSE, 1:OPEN, 2:HIGH, 3:LOW, 4:MEDIAN, 5:TYPICAL, 6: WEIGHTED

--- 帖子 #241 ---
We're not so much changing the angle as telling the indicator to filter out signals who's MACD angle doesn't fit our criteria. The setting to change is MinimumAngel. Set it to 0 to allow all signals then play around with it and the StartMACDShift variable to find optimum settings. Lux PS: While I think the signals this indicator is giving are quite good I in now way advise you to trade real money until YOU are happy with the results.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
hey when i open indicator with metaeditor and try to compile it it says 'TimeCurrent"-function is not defined, and it doesnt appear in indicators list wven though i put it in right folders

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Try the complied version. Lux

--- 帖子 #244 ---
thanks man

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Great job Lux! I use the FX Sniper's Ergodic CCI &amp; Trigger with your indicator. It gives an excellent 1st indication of an MA crossover and/or confirms the MACD. Change the inputs to: pq: 4 pr: 8 ps: 5 Trigger: 4 When the blue line crosses the red line down it's time to get ready to sell and when the blue line crosses the red line up time to get ready to buy. When you use this in tandem with your indicator you can filter out many more trades to increase the success rate. You may want to try it and see if you can incorporate it into your program. I'm sure like MACD there are parameters such as angle of cross and separation distance of the lines with this CCI that can lead to an even more accurate filter. For example, I notice as the CCI lines get further apart a reversal is not far away and can hint to a good exit or entry point. As well steeper crossovers are more reliable than flat ones. I believe this is the same with the MA cross as well where the steeper the MA's cross it seems the more reliable the signal. Back to backtesting......

--- 帖子 #246 ---
thanks thread starter for such simple system.can't wait for Pouria II to be release so for entry point,we wait wait until a new candle fully formed after yellow line crossed and MACD level should be +0 or -0? anyone who backtested it,please share your experience.thanks

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Just a few tips under "constructive criticism": Take the 5MA off. It's not necessary simply b/c it's only showing price action and lags greatly. The days of MA crossings are so long gone especially the 5MA. Use a close above/below the longer MA's for entries. The 75/85 MA's are very similar to the 50/55 SMA/EMA. Price action is much more aligned with the latter b/c these MA's are used more in trading. I personnally like the MACD and it's settings. For those who prefer to trade the 30M chart and are scrambling for filters, go to the TSD forum and look at the CatFX50 thread. Good luck with all, kt

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Great job buddy and the real KISS set up you have shared with us all. Looking forward to your "Pouria Method II". Financial trading is "Keep It Short and Simple " and you proved it.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I think we should use original trading rules and respect MACD zero line rule. It can filter many loss trades... I think it isn't irrelevant... Look below...

--- 帖子 #250 ---
RadyFox...thanks for the chart. Does that mean....when the MACD is flat like that....it would not be positive or negative (the numbers) in real time? Because that is a great indicator and to me is not irrelevant if it shows that well in real time. BP

--- 帖子 #251 ---
This week was a great week for the system! I trade the MACD on the angle. If the MACD is moving in the direction of the MA cross than that's your confirmation. Whether it's above or below 0 doesn't matter. It hasn't made mattered in my back testing of the EA... my extensive (madman) manual testing... and live trading this week... and radyfox's chart shows that as well. I plugged in the 50 and 55 MA's as was proposed above... it increased the net profit and profit%... it's worth checking out! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
to get these signals or just manually and I was interested if you think the origional time frames are still the best on the pairs? Thanks for sharing!

I personally love this system... this is the only way I trade... but I set up strict rules to using it, and I have a strict money management system... I don't want to deviate from the original system but I have taken the system and tweaked a bit, based on a week of back testing, with every possible setting... I use 30min charts on them all except EUR/JPY thats a 15 min chart. It was over 50% profitable for the past 2years on a 15 min... which was the best result out of all the other chart times.... I tend to get in the trade a little earlier and out a little more profitable with a 55 EMA and a 50 SMA... the MACD settings are great and work perfect with those measurements... Those MA's are almost identical to the original 75LWMA and 85LWMA... the others tested substantially better.. so I use them... but they are pretty much the same.. in fact I think someone on this thread reccommended those as well... they are a bit more tradable.. Overall I love this system.. as a mathematician, those MA time measurements coupled with a momentum indicator (the MACD with the 15,26,1 settings), over time I can't deny it's profitibility. You can use this system and be very profitible, if it fits your style of trading... and of course your Money Management system. Hapy Trading!

mwilkinw, Thanks for your comments above. What is your TP usually? Can't remember if you've already said.... Did you start this method before forexpert posted it? Or do you mean you started it right when he posted it? Thanks, BP

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Did you really mean you backtested for one week? "I don't want to deviate from the original system but I have taken the system and tweaked a bit, based on a week of back testing, with every possible setting..."

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Dear Forex Expert, Please elucidate, what means by all this: ---------------- THE POURIA METHOD period: 85 method: (linear Weight) apply to: (low) color: red period: 75 method: (linear weight) apply to: (low) color: red period: 5 method: (expodential) apply to: (close) color: yellow MACD FAST EMA:15 SLow EMA: 26 MACD SMA: 1 ******************************************** SHORT: when the yellow line crosses the 2 red lines downward and get the confirmation from the MACD it has to be downward too LONG: when the yellow line crosses the 2 red lines upward and get the confirmation from the MACD it has to be upward too -------------------------------------------------------------------------- the 85, 75 and 5 "method", are these separate methods or SMA's? Very confusing, too terse my friend. Please detail in English these greenhorns can understand (well, my crowd as greenhorns, at least &lt;tee-hee&gt;). Full description please along with how long you been doing with this average 50 pips per day. THx! Truly, Jerry

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hey BearPaw! Yes! I used a derivation of this sytem for a couple of months... it was a 5EMA and 75LWMA... very similar to this system, without the MACD, it was with a stochastic 14,3,3... This system is definitely more profitable... so I kind of have a feel for a MA and momentum trading strategy! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi everyone, I've got a quick question that I'm not clear on if someone doesn't care to answer; is there a stoploss and if so is it different for different pairs or the same? What is it? I've read through the whole thread and I'm still not 100%. Thanks in advance....Valerie....

--- 帖子 #262 ---
for stoploss, i personally try to look two ways, currency volatility and s/r, for example GBP/Jpy, with large spread and quite volatile i'm not sure 14 pips like the recommended S/l is sufficient. the next best thing is to check the S/r, As for S/r, i don't really use pivot point, I just look the candle and look for possible s/r and add the spread than that's my SL. that's my imho, i think forexpert310 can give precise answer since he's the one that brought this method to us all.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hello Luxinterior, I have a quick regarding your indicator. I'm quite surprised by the accuracy of the results on USDCHF, its very high. The only question I have is whether the entries plotted in history are accurate when applied in real time? As in, does it place the entry at the open of the candle, or does it calculate it after the candle closes? Also, what settings are you using for the plotted entries as they do not seem to correlate with the drawn lines. Thanks for a great indicator.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Yes, MACD can be different in real time. But forexpert310 wrote here, we should trade it after closed candle. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=116 If I understand MACD calculation, the indicator is changing in real time only between last and penultimate candle. It means if you wait for closing (and opening new) candle in positive/negative MACD range the MACD line can't fall above/below zero line anymore. MACD indicator between 3rd and 2nd candle (from right) can't change anymore.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
PS: If someone wants to trade it according to MACD angle, I think it is better to implement Vegas 4h trading rules and not wait for MAs cross.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Thank for this system.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I am by no means a programmer but I entered this strategy into expert advisor Builder and created these 2 EA's. They backtest very well. Give them a try if you wish. Great thread here. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I have to be doing something wrong with the first indicator as I took a $3000 loss in back testing. I know manually I am positive. Any insight on the input settings or back test setup you used in your EA's would help. Good work by the way!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Ok, I see the problem with the stop loss set at 500 in the EA

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Well, I've backtested a few pairs on 2006. Including USD/JPY, GBPJPY, EUR/GBP, EUR/USD and USD/CHF. It seems that the EUR/USD is, from my manual backtesting the only pair that has a considerably high accuracy rate. USD/CHF had a high accuracy rate too but the 15 stoploss/10 take profit lowers the results on the long run. I've tried backtesting it again with 15/15, and 10/10 settings, but the results were far worse. What has your experience been with the different pairs? Which pair do you think this works best with?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
[quote=Masterblue;214456] 15 stoploss/10 take profit This equals a 2:3 profit ratio. Would not fit my money management. You would need a 60% win/loss ratio to break even.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Ok...so this evening...it closed out the short audjpy from Friday for a loss. -20 Opened a buy audjpy...it then hit its sl for -20. Right now have 3 trades open...usdchf, gbpusd, eurousd. Thanks guys, BP

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I am trying out your system on the GBP/USD and I find that the further apart the 85 and 75 when the 5 crosses the more likely the move will be short lived and tends to be more flat. Did you notice too. Mike

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I am using more lines with this as entry / exits 25/35 White 45/55 BlueViolet 75/85 Red I think this really adds to the system. Take a small position on the white line cross. Add more on the BlueViolet Cross and take the final on the red Cross, if it is still strong .... then have TP values accordingly. 40/50sl This seems to work well for me. Seems to be much more profitable than just the 75/85 Cross. Mikhail and all ...... set this up on your Charts and eyeball the results. I would like an EA made that would split up orders in asimular fashion. I think this will work. IMO PAPERTRADE THIS ONLY UNTIL PROVEN TO WORK!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Interesting stuff ut2DAMax, will be nice to see what others see about that... Anyway, Rehashing the night thus far..... audjpy Short (from friday) Stopped out -20 audjpy Buy Stopped out -20 usdchf Sell Stopped out -20 Open right now gbpusd Buy still open eurusd Buy still open audjpy Sell still open Its amazing that audjpy is getting so much action.... Anyway thats the story as of right now...gbp and aud are close to SL but we shall see.... BP

--- 帖子 #276 ---
That audjpy short doesn't look so good now. But anyway we'll see.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Why does it not look so good?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Listen guys, this method is safer to be used manually not by putting SL/TP and going to sleep, be on it, take your prof and get out 10-15 pips depends on the currency, this system is very simple... if you want to really make money, when you start a trade sit behind your computer until you close that trade, some times brokers will screw you over your TP, it is better to do it manually, and you can't tell me this method can't get you that 10-15 pip prof... you should follow the rules...

--- 帖子 #279 ---
be creative ..... don't take no for an answer .... we can make this a good Method ..... IMO .... Look at my last post .... please give me your input how we can maybe make this Method even better. IMO ..... Thanks ... BearPaw .... Thanks all!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Here are backtest results for the EA I attached http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Sorry if you misunderstood me. I like this system. It very simple. I appreciate that you share this system. Exactly I had a profit on a long on audjpy at market open from 94.54 to 94.77.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I have read your concept several times, sorry for being so stupid here I don't see this at all. You said I thought start when crosses 25-35 add so many units add at 45-55 more units and 75-85 add final units. What do you use to confirm 25-35 first add with ? What stop loss at this point? What confirms 45-55 add and now what stop loss? Then 75-85 add do you still use MACD confirm then what stop loss? It appears you get whiped saw all around on the first 25-35 add, and lots of time of course never get to 75-85 add. I am probably missing your point here somewhere? Sorry for being so stupid..... Thanks

hi forexexpert310,its nice to hear fr u again abt this system! i guess u r right abt when to take profits....i do have a question-can this system trade on news? when will u be releasing your pouria II?? thanks..

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Yes I use MACD to confirm 75/85 ...... and TSI-Osc indicator / Fisher_v1 .... that does not re-paint, for the white and Blue Violet ma's! 40/50sl ... tp ... still working on best settings. tp is really to ones taste, depending on the pairs traded. Really wanted input from others .... this just gives you more opportunity to trade. I do not trade just one Method. I will start forward testing this more this week. Thanks

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Pouria Method II will be coming up soon, I'm still working on it with a team of professionals and mathematicians who have been in the field of forex for over 10 years. Pouria Method II is going to be based on statistics and math, and it is very complicated but is very very profitable! This system is going to be one of a kind.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Thanks. This system is great!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
cant wait to see your pouria method II soon!!good day!!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
forexpert310 .... thanks for your all your kindness on sharing your Methods! Very nice of you! I used this Method with GBP/USD today ..... it works. IMO

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Here is a heads up on this method this evening and how it can work. Thier were 4 crosses that I noticed here is where they started and stand at the moment. NZD/USD Entry Point on 30min chart @ .6842 present price .6857 I did not take this trade but even if you had a 4 point spread as I do over at forex/com you still would have made 10 pips GPB/USD Entry Point on 30min chart @ 1.9524 present price 1.9547 I took this trade with a 5 pip spread and still made 17 pips. EUR/USD Entry Point on 30min chart @ 1.3019 present price 1.3026 I got in early on this one and left with 16 a few minutes ago. AUD/JPY Entry Point on 30min chart @ 94.37 present price 94.37 I am still in this one. If you had used a 2 lot method you would be sitting well right now.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Forexpert, any timeline when the Pouria II will be out?? Thanks for the great system. Selveen

--- 帖子 #292 ---
forexpert310, do you us a hard stop when trading this?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thanks Forexpert.....Pouria seems like a good system!! Hopefully we are using it correctly. BP

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I appreciate you keeping your responses simple and to the point without any complicated explanation. Some people can take the simpliest concepts and complicate them with too much education. I think if you trade this system with a tight stop loss the Broker will stop the loss for you at whatever you tell him to. Once the lines are crossed..if you missed it just wait for it to retrace of sell it at the top if its a sell and VV. Then you can use a reasonable stoploss. Otherwise the winning percentages decline. Very powerful system if you use your imagination and past price action. Thanks You the Man. BigDog

--- 帖子 #296 ---
How did you create this? The pic didn't show. I was referring to a pic posted in an earlier thread.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Just trying to get a feel for the consensus opinion here. ARe most of us still using the original 85 and 75 LWMAs or have we switched to the 50 55 LWMAs? I know that was posted a while back and just wondered what the general feeling is at this point. Thanks for the interesting system forexpert310!

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I am using the original 85 and 75 at this time. BP

--- 帖子 #299 ---
thanks BearPaw. You know, your results are excellent. Also, one can never tell about this, but if you had traded only the GBPUSD and EURUSD you would have earned 70 pips. That doggoned AUDJPY! Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Are you referring to post#266? It's just an indicator I put together to show the distance between the ma. It's just simple enough for me since I'm not a programmer. I just piece together from other code. If you like I can post it here once I get home. The coding is not perfect, there might be some bugs. If some can offer to look at it and clean it up. That would be nice.

If your using aud/jpy on 30m try changing it to 1h if 1h change it to 30m

There were some lovely set-ups today.... Can not thank you enough for sharing this strategy! Nice and simple, and above all very tradeable, especially with good MM.

Crossed over, but it crossed over after news. So I technically might not play or count it. But if it reverses, and there was news, I'm demonstrating that when you backcheck failures and when it worked, news may have been a factor and could skew the results. A bad or good backtest could be due to news events.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
This is great. Thanks. Your tips on using it as you see it would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
The two white numbers at the bottom represent how many pips away from the 85 nd 75 the 5 is. Very clever. Thanks again.

Took the signal on USDJPY for 15 pips. I guess I should of stay in a little longer. Jim At least I should of stayed in to watch it break yesterday's low.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
This is a great system. I just closed a USD/JPY trade for 20 pips( sorry I got greedy) in about one hour. Looking at the GBP right now.

Any idea why I only get 0.0000 values for all pairs? I am running it on IBFX mini account. Maybe the pairs labels dont fit?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Yes, that was it, I am fixingit myself.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
mind to explain how to use your indicator?don't understand how it works.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
It gives you a one glance overview of where the moving averages are on all pairs traded. If the 75 and 85 values are red, they are below the 5. If they are gold they are above the 5. The last 2 rows are the differences in pips between the 75 + 85 and the 5. I think its quite self-explaining when you look at it.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
so we enter when 5-85,5-75 value = -ve rite? how about the time frame of all shown pairs?is it follow the original time frame given by forexpert?

Hello there Forexpert310, Thanks for your generosity in sharing such a powerful system. Just one thing that people using Metatrader4 may not be aware of, &amp; that is the MACD that comes as standard isnt a normal MACD &amp; will give totally different results to ones on different platforms even on same time settings. The real MACD on Metatrader4 is the "Moving Average of Oscillator". The only problem with this though, is that when the sma is put to 1, then the histogram dissappears from the screen. Does anyone know a way around this? or can someone write an MACD that doesnt do this? Happy day TORAG

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Try this one http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...highlight=MACD

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Thanks ICIP, I tried this indicator &amp; it seems to give same results as Metatraders own MACD. Not being very technical I dont really know why this is. I was using another system a while back &amp; people using the metatrader MACD were getting wrong entries, until somebody realised they should have been using the Moving Average of Oscillator. Thanks again happy day TORAG

Ok, So here are my results for today....or specifically from Monday 8am to Today 9am, EST. I might have entered a couple incorrectly...looking back at that to make sure I know what I could have done wrong...but anyway.... 17 entries and exits triggered. Unprofitable - 7 trades (sl is 20) Profitable - 10 trades (tp varies according to rules of Pouria) Net result is -7 pips. So, Day 1 = 40 pips profit. Day 2 = -7 pips profit. Still looking good!! Thanks, BP

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I still stand by this, and possibly some signals between NY and Asian possibly. I can't believe all these signals crossed in between checks. Wow, these can really happen at any time. I missed them all. Even though I completely ignored anything involving GBP yesterday. There's always tonight.

Today i had one trade on EURUSD and it was profitable +16 so here are my results so far for EURUSD ( the only pair i trade with this system) +15 +15 -14 +13.5 +16 so far so good.

Great result. Too bad for me I only have time during Asian session or if I'm awake enough, Euro session.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Lex.... I have only had 3 trades for the eur/usd pair triggered since sunday night with the system. Buy Sell Buy and they have all been profitable....so if I just had those pairs, I would be at +45 from Sunday evening till Tuesday morning EST. BP

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Great results...why do you only trade euro with this strategy?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
EURUSD is more smooth than other pairs i like it more plus ive backtested it and it showed best results

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Ive checked some of the past data, and the best thinkg to do with this strategy is dont trade between US close and EU open and of couse 2-3 hours before major news, this is a good filter to avoid bad trades even though if you miss some good ones.

Simple Pouria EURUSD +430 PIPS January 2007 Maximum drawdown 30 pips 95% Wins (23/24) The current Pouria method is extremely successful. However, I like concrete numbers to work with if I am going to back test anything and don't want fudge forward trading because MA lines jiggle during an active candle. While trying to work out a non-variable way of testing Pouria I noticed that the only thing that mattered was the 5 MA crossing the 75/85 MA. I noticed that false signals were generally whipsaws that had very low stop losses if you exited if the 5 MA retraced back across the 75/85 MA. I also wanted a firm entry and exit point. If you look at the summary attached you will see I missed huge gains by taking a simple fixed approach. I have not worked out an optimal money management strategy for this yet but this simple method presented is statistically ultra conservative. The Simple Pouria Rules (Only tested on EURUSD) 1. Put the 5 MA and 75/85 MA's on your chart just like Pouria 2. No MAcD required 3. Time frame 30 mins 4. Stop Loss 30 pips 5. Target Profit 20 pips To go long: 5 MA line crosses up both 75/85 MA and that this cross is confirmed by the close of the current candle. You open at the opening of the next candle. (You can see the 5 MA line across the 75/85 MA and the candle is closed....no fudging). To go short: 5 MA crosses down both 75/85 MA and that this cross is confirmed by the close of the current candle. You open at the opening of the next candle. BAD TRADES: A bad trade involves either hitting the stop loss or the 5 MA retracing and recrossing the 75/85 MA in the opposite direction. If the 5 MA retraces you close your first position and open up a new position with 2 lots. If it retraces again close your position and open up with 3 lots, etc. In otherwords, you are in a whipsaw (without hitting yopur S/L) and you are covering your previous losses on each retrace until success comes. This assumes you can only have only all buy or all sell trades on from your broker (no hedging). If you are more conservative, you can simply close the first position and open the next position with 1 lot, your losses will be small and not greatly affect your bottom line. Risk Return: Under normal circumstances I would never trade a 3:2 risk/return, however in this case the stop loss limit of 30 is an emergency stop. In most cases you will only require 12 pips or less for a stop loss. The high percentage of wins reduce exposure to risk of the 30 pip stop loss. I had experimented with a 20 pip S/L but found the 30 provided more room for profit and provided a "trade and forget" allowance. You can easily bring this to a 1:1 risk return and still earn +200 pips. Ultra Conservative Trading: If you really want to keep your pip exposure low, trade only those MA crosses that are very close to the 75/85 lines. Some candles first crossing the MA lines are big and can give you a 10-15 pip exposure if the 5 MA retraces. This would be a great EA as it is very black and white when to open and close trades. I am back testing other currencies by hand, and would appreciate any help with confirming the success of this using other currencies and longer testing periods....any one that could put together a simple EA?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Do you mean this....?? Go short when the 5ma crosses UP? Go long when the 5ma crosses down? Looks backwards to me. Thanks for any clarification.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
My bad. I have corrected it. Thanks for your eagle eyes!!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I like the simple pouria rules, and yes...from my manual backtesting it seems that the EUR/USD is the one that has a high success rate. I think it would be beneficial for all of us to create a list of excellent currencies to trade with this system, currencies that you need to watch the trade for and maybe exit quickly with a few pips, and currencies that would be difficult to trade either due to spread or high volatility/required stoploss. Foexexpert if you could shed light on this issue it would be appreciated. I know you trade all of the pairs, but I'm certain some have a higher success rate than others. As for the simple pouria rules, and the normal pouria system. I believe one needs to backtest it at least a year to determine win percentage.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Are any of you using Oanda ? If so, what MAs are you using for the 75/85? I cannot see how to adjust from using the close price to the low price.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Yes I agree. I was hoping someone could develop an EA for Simple Pouria to make the backtest more thorough. I thought the numbers were encouraging for EURUSD and wanted to share them with everyone in hopes of a thorough back and forward test.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Anybody see a possible G/U trade in the next hour? Seems like the last 2 bounces off the long (85 &amp; 75) MAs have made higher lows. Chart: http://img162.imageshack.us/img162/7516/11613394fs1.gif

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I did quick and dirty tests on the EURGBP and EURJPY using Simple Pouria and had excellent results. EURGBP (H1) I lowered the TP to 15 pips but kept the SL at 30 pips. EURJPY (M30) I kept the TP at 20 pips and SL at 30 pips. I back tested to Jan 1 on each pair and the results were both above 90%. In both cases if the SL was not hit but the 5 MA retraced I closed the failed trade and increased the new open trade to cover my previous loss. Again, most stops required were under 12 pips and most carry over losses were under 10 pips. I am certain with more study there could be a much better strategy to capture the large pip gains that are missed.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Yes, got my eye on that possible trade too.... Just noticed your MACD settings different to mine...I have set up as 15,26,1 as per post 1. Do you prefer this set-up? Angie

--- 帖子 #349 ---
No Angie, i missed the MACD settings on the first post - these are the default settings from MT4. I will change them since I want to demo this exactly as shown in that post. Thanks for catching that. Looks like the candle will close above the long MAs in a couple of minutes, I will be taking the trade, 15 pip sl, 20 pip tp.

Hi ghamal You are very welcome. Wish you luck in this trade. I have just taken this trade myself, a little early I know, but only on demo account at the moment. Regards Angie

--- 帖子 #352 ---
January has been extremely good month for backtesting i have found, try december of 2006 see if it still comes out as good. I had 7 losses in the row for december noted down however i may be wrong but it would be nice to see what others get.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
So far so good.....almost there!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
on my chart the confirmation to go long just happened now at 72, because before MACD want positive :S

--- 帖子 #355 ---
sorry i mean not now but at the start of current canndle, i went long just now at 71 with very small amount just to test it, lets see how it plays out.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I thought MACD just needed to be heading in the direction of the trade. The first post doesn't mention that MACD needs to be &gt; 0 for long or &lt; 0 for short, it just says moving "upward" for long and "downward" for short. Waiting for MACD to be positive o negative would seem to cut down the number of signals alot. I'm long from 9469 (open of candle an hour ago). Just got charged swap so it better work out lol

They using the Simple method (No MACD). Jim

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Spot on. As I am only demoing this trade I chanced an early entry...trading this live I think I would most likely wait for the MACD to confirm. Does anyone have RSI as a confirming indicator? If so, setting at 14 or 21? Thanks Angie

Testing the Simple verison of the method. (No MACD). Jim

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hello, first thanks for this great system. And at this moment just for info, i am start to write an EA this evening. Tomorow i must/will finish another EA and go in test, and beginn then with my Pouria EA. When all goes normal i must finish in 3-4 days. Cheers Mobsie

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Nice work Spudfyre! Appreciate the time and effort that went into this. I was going to do manual backtest of simple Pouria just to get more familiar with the system. I will try and do GBP/USD at the week-end if time permits. Thanks again...

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I thought I was trading the original method and the only confirmation from MACD that was needed was that short: "the confirmation from the MACD it has to be downward too" LONG: "the confirmation from the MACD it has to be upward too" Actually I probably shouldn't have even waited for the first candle to close after the 5MA crossed the long MAs, would have gotten me out of the trade profitably by now. BTW CHF/JPY also looking like it will signal soon.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I thought that was the whole point of MACD to filter out unwanted trades, so if the cross happened to the upside but MACD below 0 the trade whould not be taken thats how i viewed it. If you look at the past data it does in some cases stop you from making bad trades but only sometimes, most of the times it will confirm loosing trade anyway.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I think what forexpert310 meant is that the slope of the MACD should heading up or down according to the trade, not that it should be &gt;0 or &lt;0. i.e. there should not be divergence between MACD and the 5MA. Waiting for MACD to cross 0 seems safer, but it might get you in too late, and this system seems to work because it uses the MAs to spot times where the momentum has a high probability of getting you a quick 10 - 20 pips. idk you have more screen time backtesting this so I am hoping to hear what you keep finding.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I am by no means a mq4 programmer but made some changes to accommodate the mini accounts. someone please double check the code.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
well im testing it on live account atm, been good to me so far will see how it goes but i see potential in this system, just checked some past trades and you are right once EMA5 crosses its better to enter straight away thatn waiting for MACD and besides in majority of cases MACD will cross above 0 anyway. Also the strategy i will be using in terms of money management is as follows: If it is a winning trade then keep position the same for 5 winning trades then increase. If i get loosing trade then on the next trade i will put the same amount of money , in after loosing trade winning trade comes then continue with the same position size but if 2nd consecutive loss will come then i will double up on the next position. So far the max number of negative trades been 7 however i will have a look again at that without waiting for MACD to cross over 0.000 line, other than that one incident max number of consecutive lossses had been 3which means that i would have to double up 3 times which i can comfortably do I dont leverage up yet on this strategy since Im only testing it right now so i can double up about 7-8 times comfortably. will see how it goes, ill try to keep you posted if you want

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I founding this method but with an additional confirmation on my own. That why I got in earlier.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Just a quick addition to the above, i looked at the 7 consecutive loosing trades and it turnes out that i did it wrong and there was one winning in the middle which makes it 3 loosing 1 winner and 3 lossers again, and i didnt try to give it the benefit of a doubt or tried to persuade myself that it was a winning trade it actualy was. But once again i confirmed to myself not to trade before major news.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I found a minor mistake on my part for audjpy. Here are the minor update.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I see potential too. And yes the martingale method would be nice for this system as the consecutive # of loses seem low (you say around 3 in your backtesting?). Well, thats the theory anyway. Please keep me posted of your results, i will do the same.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Has anybody considered using 75 and 85 WMAs on the highs for short entries? I've done some manual backtesting with this system and it seems as though there are more losing short trades than long trades. Has anybody else found this to be the case? If this is accurate, I think it might make sense to add 75 and 85 WMAs on the high prices and use that band of moving averages for short entries and use the 75 and 85 WMAs on the lows for long entries.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I just started demo testing this as well and I have adjusted the EUR/USD TP to 30 pips and the GBP/USD to 85 pips. The only reason being that the EUR doesn't move the same distance as the GBP and I'd rather 1) be profitable and 2) not have to hold a trade for too long as the EA will get another signal as we go. So far I am in two EA activated demo trades: EUR/USD B @ 3026 +9 so far GBP/USD B @ 9453 +19 so far CLOSED BOTH ABOVE: EUR +11, GBP +20 for +31 overall EA has just activated two more: EUR/USD B @ 3038 GBP/USD B @ 9477

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I back tested my nemisis the USDCAD on the H1 for Nov/Dec 2006. I simply used 30 PIP S/L and 20 PIP TP as I didn't have time to statistically measure the stops and maximum profits that would optimize this to some degree. I am sure this can be improved with more detailed statistical analysis. This was done with my earlier explanation of the Simple Pouria with no MACD.....e.g. Candle must close and the 5 MA has to be definitely clear and across the 75/85 MA. Maximum drawdown was 30 pips with the average being less than 12 pips. Results are positive. November +143 PIPS 9 Wins 3 Losses 75% Success December +212 PIPS 10 Wins 3 Losses 77% Success I really like the consistency between the 2 months. Attached are the details of the study. Hopefully someone can develop an EA so that we can optimize each pair...my eyes are going buggy doing this by hand.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi luxinterior,Thanks for your indicator. How do change the alert sound? I changed mine to one I have in my sound folder, but I still get the default sound. Apprreciate your assistance.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I considered it and I will add the WMAs on High to my charts. In my eyes it only makes sense, thats why I asked earlier about why the WMAs are applied to the Low.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
hello all... im starting to study this thread for a week...but im strugling here.. what i mean i when to open trade???.... is it on open candle????.... is it as soon as ma's crossed???.... is it on the price action??... can someone answer me???anyone...

--- 帖子 #377 ---
enter when ma's crossed and macd either above 0 when long or below 0 when short.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
My method is like driving a car with a seatbelt on, my MACD and close of the candle rule plays seatbelt’s role, some people drive without a seatbelt, they “could” get into an accident and get hurt or they can survive, so if you follow my rules you might lose some extra pip but you’re on the safe side, but if you want to make quick pip and have no patience then you don’t need to wear a seatbelt.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
good explanation.so just follow the rule and be discipline

--- 帖子 #380 ---
so wait till ma confirm a cross n open trade on the open candle...hope this rite..but the real problem is my broker put 10 pips spread on big news day...its turn me into monkey when after 4 hours open ten lots without seeing +ve pips...my strategy is to win 10 pips in one trade n i need to win 50 pips per day...is this method gonna produce 5 signal per day??

--- 帖子 #381 ---
it is better don't trade before or during news

--- 帖子 #382 ---
GBPUSD signal are about to coming for short position but not yet confirmed.. if we got a signal confirmation before gbpo news...do u take action??... anyone can answer this...and i hope forexexpert can write his opinion...

--- 帖子 #383 ---
?? i dont see a short position anywhere today on gbp/usd. i just made 15 pips going long though .

--- 帖子 #384 ---
yup its not crossed..im waiting for it to cross

--- 帖子 #385 ---
steer clear during news time.

Hello all. These are the results I have from 9am EST yesterday to 8am EST today. 9 trades total. 5 profitable 4 losses Net gain/loss of +5 pips SL is at 20 for each pair and TP are as defined in original Pouria method. So, cumalative results.... Day 1 = +40pips Day 2 = -7pips Day 3 = +5pips Slowing down a little...but we shall see!! BP

--- 帖子 #387 ---
which pairs u traded?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I started late yesterday afternoon, around the end of the NYC session. So far the EA has dropped me in 5 demo trades and all 5 have been successful. GBP +20 EUR +11 GBP +20 EUR +20 JPY +15 total +86 My demo account was at $5,100 when I stared and is now at $5,492.76 an increase of 7.7% in one day. I am just going to keep the computer on and the EA active all week. The JPY trade was opened and closed as I slept last night. So far so good for this strategy. I'm using a 50 pip SL and a 15 or 20 pip TP as is recommended on the first page. I have loaded the EA for only four currencies: GBP/USD, EUR/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
BTW, the first two trades, GBP and EUR, were closed manually by me, The next three were all opened and closed by the EA as per my set TP parameters.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I am trying to catch up with this EA. I have two questions, if you don't mine. What platform are you using and where is the EA to download Appreciate your help. AJ

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I'm using this on the MT4 platform. If you go to Forums: trading systems: you'll see a link for the Pouria Development Thread. Be sure to read the whole thing and use version #3.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Thank you AJ

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I am using the EA...beta 3...with all the currencies that Forexpert recommended except CADJPY cause my broker does not have it. yesterday I was entered into GBP trade once and usdjpy trade twice. Here is what was entered yesterday and the results. My TP is as Forexpert recommended. My SL is at 20. Maybe the stop loss needs to be changed? Have not looked at that. NZDUSD +25 EURCHF -20 EURCHF +15 GBPUSD -20 CHFJPY -20 AUDJPY +15 USDJPY -20 CHFJPY +15 USDJPY +15 Currently there are no open positions. A very slow day so far. BP

--- 帖子 #394 ---
spudfyre, i really like the simple pouria variation you have and will like to help in the backtesting manually. have you done any more backtests. also with the backtest results you have shared, did you include spread, if so how much? thanks

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I left out spread since it seems to vary between brokers. Basically that adjusment has to be added in. I see that the new EA on the EA thread is being modified to allow one to adjust to the Simple Pouria method. The 30 S/L and 20 TP were quick and dirty numbers just by eyeballing the numbers. I'm going to crunch out EUR/GBP today and do some statistical analysis to find the optimum S/L and TP levels for that pair. I'll include spread this time based on my broker.

My results for yesterday: Zero pips. I didn't take any trades. I stayed away from cable obviously, and I was watching dollar/yen. I really thought it would cross, and never did on my screens. I was hoping to play that one. I don't have anything automated, everything is completely discretionary over here. If I miss a signal, then I miss a signal. If I don't like the pair that night I don't touch it. As I get comfortable with the method and the times of day these things cross, I'll get more in gear to trade more often. But it's as simple as that. Last night just wasn't my night. Tonight I'm unsure. I may stay away from anything Euro around 6am. Don't know about GBP retail sales. I'll try to write a script for my broker, but it may take a while since I never had. Looks like a combo of Visual Basic and C++. That way it can be an alarm clock.

EA dropped me into trade #6 about 20 min. ago. EUR/JPY S @ 157.90 and closed out for +20 @ my TP of 157.70. So through two days of demo trades the EA has initiated six trades, all positive, for a total of +106 pips. I hope this isn't a fluke. Will continue to leave the program open, allowing for EA trades as I sleep, for the rest of the week. BTW, I just added the EA to the EUR/JPY about 15 min before this trade was opened. I now have six currencies that the EA demo trading on with the EUR/JPY and the USD/CAD as the latest two added.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Just noticed that I, as of right now, could have gone for +40 on that last trade. I think it's important to follow the originator's direction as far as going for higher lots and less pips. Demo account has increased 9.3% in two days.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Thank you for posting your results please continue doing so

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Sundevil.... Which version of the EA are you using? Great results so far.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I'm using beta 3. Again, at first I was looking at going for much higher profits, as we have all had the discussion of "leaving pips on the table", but watching how the first two trades went +20, -20, and then +20 I realized that the originator was correct in his philosophy of getting in and out. Like I said, I'm hoping that this system will "pass the test" and show consistent results. If it can produce +50 per week then I'd be sold in a big way. Obviously at +106 for two days is beyond belief and certainly exciting. If this continues to perform through next week I'll then move to test it with a live mini-account.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
So far so good, but it has only traded on 1 day. Nothing today. Just change the .xml to .htm

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hello 1Sundevil, Happy to see that you have found good settings for the EA. pls take a look at the new version I have posted, I have added a feature "mincrossdistance", which I believe will greatly enhance the winrate of this EA because it eliminates the trades that occur when 5MA is just hovering very near the 75&amp;85 MA without really going anywhere. Beta 3 will suffer consecutive losses when this happens so pls also test new version 1.1 just for comparison purposes. Thanks for testing, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Dude beta 2 has too many bugs, pls update your version. thanks. -Mikhail

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Yeah I've already started using version 1.1

--- 帖子 #409 ---
could you explain the value of the distance???... is it valued by the ma's value??...pips??...and how much distance are u using??...sorry for being silly

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi, Tried to look for answers in thread but couldn't find it. My trading platform does not have "linear" MA, would using "weighted" be the same? Also when I change the MACD settings it goes to just a single line. Any help would be appreciated, I am using VTtrader.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Thanks for the indicator, It's look very nice when I apply it to chart. What is the different between the mq4 and ex4 ? Is the indicator according the original or you modified it ? which should I use ? is the version 1.2.1 is the newest ? should I change anything in the indicator, or just follow the alert ? why is the reset alert in false mode ? Lux, Thanks very much for the contribution, can't wait to test it Regards, Okabija

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Use metatrader, it's free. you can download in www.northfinance.com , pick the demo. use metatrader just for signal, and you could still trading in VTtrader. hope this help Regards, Okabija

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks for sharing your system, Can't wait to test it. Hope this system make lots of green pips !! Bravo forexpert !!!

--- 帖子 #414 ---
which EA and inputs? thx bj could you attach. it, thx

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I'm using beta3 with the inputs as told by the creator of the system. The only difference is that I use a -50 SL and have upped the lots to take 2 instead of .50, as is programmed on the beta. Had a small problem this morning, as I explained in the other thread, but it was my error as the system, as laid out, would have hit my TP. Still in the trade, so we'll see.

Hi, would you mind tell me what TF are you working on? because I am not getting so many crosses . With TF I work (original settings) I got just a couple of crosses a day...I guess I am doing something wrong. Thank you

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Toti...I am using the TF from the originator...except one is modified. Here they are: AUDJPY - 1hour..this is modified nzdusd - 1 hour usdcad - 1 hour eurgbp - 1 hour usdjpy - 30 min gbpusd - 30 min usdchf - 30 min eurchf - 1 hour audusd - 30 min eurjpy - 30 min chfjpy - 1 hour eurusd - 30 min Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Since the first post says "Linear Weighted" I've been using Weighted and it seems that my things show a trade the same time as all the MT4 people, so I'm pretty sure it's Weighted. Seems exact to me.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Techno79....how is your trading with the Phillip Nel strategy? Saw that you posted there. BP

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thanksj for everyone's help.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
The 4 hour macd thing? I have the instructions but haven't fully tested it yet, haven't fully been playing with systems that make you hold for a while until the account if fatter(which is why I watch this system intently). Some of the things in the guide has helped in using the MACD on shorter timeframes. There's so many systems and techniques, not enough time. Since you asked, I'm going to go through it and backcheck again, looked promising. --- What time did people enter the Cable trade? 7 or 8? If it weren't for that spike it would've worked.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Cool...well let me know...anyway what time zone are you talking about? It looks like those that had a TP of 50 did not get stopped out...Me, on the other hand, with a SL of 20 got stopped out twice. Makes me wonder about a higher stop loss. BP

Looks like EURUSD is getitng ready for a cross, will monitor it closely, daily chart also looks that there might be a nice move down tomorrow i tthink i willl let profit run on this one if stop loss is not hit that is and if signal is confirmed in the first place

--- 帖子 #426 ---
ok i went short at 29, lets seee how it goes i set the profit target to +15 , however if by the time i wake up before frankfurt open it is not triggered then i will remove it and watch for price action, because of nice volatility in the mornings.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Did your fast MA cross the other lines? Mine didn't...

--- 帖子 #428 ---
well that last trade resulted in a loss of -16 pips (14 +spread) but then it showed short signal again so i took it and got put at +15. So far then : 5 profitable trades and 1 loss on EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
That's werid. I can't tell if on my screen the candle closed after the line crossed or not. But EUR/USD is going against me every which way anyway, it needs to go lower! Been waiting for a 60min cross for a long on USD/CAD. Should've been a no brainer hours away without the system from all the commentaries online, so I hope it's a safe trade, just confirmation. If it doesn't go by the next hour, I'm off to bed, sun will come up if I keep waiting.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Got up this morning to see how many trades were entered only to find...none. I think my demo account expired, as it says "invalid account" at the bottom of the screen, so no trades were entered. I've opened a new account and will add the results to those that I've already received. Looking at the charts, I'm guessing that a trade should have been initiated for: a BUY of USD/CHF, a SELL of EUR/USD, and "possibly" a SELL of the EUR/JPY. I said possibly because technically it never broke above the 75/85 line but stayed below it, peeking above here and there before continuing down. I'm not sure how the EA would handle things in that instance.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hey guys, From the balance, Day 5 was a loser...I think this week I barely came above BE. But I need to look at it and post it later. Please look at this thread over the weekend and make comments. I am thinking that a higher SL is needed...but not sure. I will not be able to post what I see until tomorrow morning..but will do so...I am traveling all day today. Thanks, BP

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Have any of you given any thought to using a time stop, i.e. if the trade does not develop w/in a certain number of price bars after entry, then get out?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Guys please post your results thanks.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I'm still 7 for 7 and have gained 111 pips and 11.3% on the demo account. Currently the EA has me in three trades: 2 are positive (1 almost at TP) and the other slightly negative. I've listed them in the other thread.

GBP/JPY is stiring in the Long arena ... Getting closer ... IMO

Long is good. But only to 237.00, then it may come back. "Risk can be controlled with knowledge, experience, and courage."

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I think we had a long signal on USD/CAD. But with it being Sunday, and a USD holiday Monday, I'm going to skip it and "paper trade" this one. I had wanted to long this pair anyway. But unsure how it's going to react on this specific day. Being safe.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
The EA dropped me in to two trades tonight, USD/JPY buy @ 119.58, which right now is a BIG loser, and the USD/CAD buy @ 1645, which really hasn't moved. It will be interesting to see if my -50 pip SL on the JPY trade is hit or whether it turns around in my favor.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
LOL! USDJPY just turn around! Your one lucky devil! -Mikhail

--- 帖子 #441 ---
today in the morning the system gave a signal to sell eurusd ,which i did, which just materialized as a stop loss, so thats the second one, and i just went long as it gave long signal so far +2. If this will be a loser too, then i will double up on the next trade. So far then : 5 profitable trades and 2 unprofitable trades.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Yep, I was 2 pips away from my +15 TP! Now it's still positive but has dropped a little. We'll see.... I'm definitely worried about the EUR/USD trade, as it is down over 20 pips. We'll see how this shakes out.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Did anyone else enter a USDCHF trade? Buy at 2346? That one is in the negative for me right now. I am also long on the eur/usd from 3149. It is in the positive right now. Thanks, BP

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Just curious if all variables have been backtested to see which one produces the best results. Take trade when...5ema crossing the 75/85, candle crossing the 75/85, Candle closing on either side of the 75/85.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
If you would please, some of you that are using this system, PM me and tell me your real time results. I have found backtest on MA crosses to be near worthless, other then you do get practice at backtesting.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
OK last trade i entered long had take profit of +14 , juuust so another profitable trade from the system. +15 +15 +13.5 +16 -17 +15 -16 +14 total = 88.5-33=+55.5 /so 55 pips in about 2 weeks And no doubling up yet.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Well a lot of people sound like they're having a net profit. If no one else does, I need to take a day and check all the crossovers in the last month. See if there's news involved, holidays, and what time of day gave the best signals. I'm hoping that proper analysis can find out where these losing trades come from. This whole thing feels a little predictable to me, even though I keep missing the singals! AUD/USD coming close to a signal. Might not make it the next candle though unless it drops a little. I took the trade anyway, gotta do something this week.

I checked out the MA cross system before on the VTtrader from CMS. But before, I never knew what numbers to enter for the best results. It only uses two MA's, so until I study up on how to reprogram it, thats what I'm looking at. I started using 5 and 75 weighted, close on each. But here's where mine differs from Pouria...instead of MACD for confirmation, I'm using Parabolic SAR at .01 step and .4 max. These numbers still need tweaked, but seem to be a little more accurate for the time being. If the dots are on the top, it confirms a sell cross, and vise versa, bottom/buy. Not only that, for the most part, it seems to signal a good time to get out, t/p. just throwing in an extra idea, if anyone wants to run with it. I Haven't done any serious trading with it, because I just started playing with the numbers on Fri, and I hate trading when there is a holiday in US...too unpredictable...so therefore I'm not going to throw in any false claims that this is the latest greatest trading method. But so far, from what I've seen just scrolling back on the charts, it shows far and few between bad trades. Shows real promise on the pairs that do big swings. I will do some back testing this week as well, as learn how to make an EA for it. just wanted to point out, that I've been reading on this site for some time, and everyone seems to be very helpful. If I could give something back by maybe showing some different angles, it would be good feeling for me.

Yet my ozzie/dollar trade didn't work out last night! I'm so sure there's a pattern to what trades won't work, we just have to take the time and figure it out. I think I'm going to pick 2 or 3 pairs and concentrate on over others.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
interestingly enough, thats the one I'm scratching my head over. when a pair is moving side ways, the MA can really mess things up. need to find if there is a parameter for distance between high and lows maybe so we can knock times when a pair is consolidating. no matter what, nothing is a guarantee, as I think we all know here, so it really still comes down to research, knowing whats going on in the global economy, intuition and gut instincts, but most of all, money management. (but a good indicator wouldn't hurt )

--- 帖子 #453 ---
First time here guys. Thanks for all the info provided. I have been able to take lots of pips from this "pouria Method" (75+85MA, 5EMA). What i have noticed on the 1hour chart EUR/GBP the 75 &amp; 85 work as a Support point. Could it be that if the currency bounces off the 75,85 red lines it turns bullish? I tried it on it and bought at 0.6690 as the pair bounced off the 2 red lines and i easily made 50+pips as i sold at 0.6740.

When I entered, I did during the early part of asian on two thoughts. I keep hearing in some commentaries about AUD/USD being top heavy and a possible short. I thought the rangebound was consolidation on another move down, AND it was a tight box! It almost broke my box by 2 pips, then reversed. Okey I thought. Went to the top side of the box, did a false breakout I guess. If I didn't let it get stopped out, it would've probably reversed and given me my 10 pips this morning, but by then it gave a long signal on that reverse. Otherwise I don't think I'd normally enter a ranging market, rather play the trends...but as long as it's not a HUGE trend, or a big news bar. Lotta criteria on my end.

Yes. I also found that 5EMA works better than 5MA

EA lost me money overall too. I think there needs to be changes maybe and I do not have the answers on what will work better. Mikhial will get it to work better ... just give him time ....

MACD ... 3,9,1 works a lot better for this Method. Try it ..... tell me what you think. IMO

--- 帖子 #463 ---
and you will see how the 3,9,1, MACD helps to make this Method more tradable. just IMO Just something for you all to try and see how it works for you. I am hoping the newer versions EA incorporates this as well. But you can adjust the moving averages to what works best. I do not think this is a dead end METHOD . I think the Method can survive and evolve to a working system. Just my 2 cents ..... I also switch between 30min and 1hr charts ... not necessarily following the origional time settings.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Ut, With the 30/35 and 50/55 ma's, are you saying just replace those with the 75 and 85 ma's as they are now? With the same settings? Are you saying to have 4 now instead of the 2 that we had before? replace 75 with a 30 and a 35, etc..? Thanks for the other link as well...looking into it. BP

Well, another day has passed and Forexpert has not been able to give any advice concerning the gbpusd trade. Another day means another GBPUSD trade that is -50 in the hole. So, 2 options...1) change the timeframe on the chart for the GBPUSD. 2) stop trading the GBPUSD pair. I am open to suggestions from anyone on this matter. Thoughts? BP

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Move on. This is an awful risk management system. (Not to mention the super-late entry dynamics). This is an in arguable statement. We're drawn to higher hit-rate systems but Forex is too easy an entry market. Spend more time developing and/or looking at systems that have good risk/money mgmt. structure.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I have to intrepret your statistics. -13th, I only see 2 trades -15th. I'm assuming, as I have to read the charts, you entered on a 100 pip dip candle on GBP disappointing retail sales figure. Maybe this would've been okey if you were expecting a further trend in NY. Then at 9 I guess you got stopped out due to a horrible TIC report, and posssible Fed speaking. I don't know if that says you have 2 losses or what. I don't know where the second would come form. -20th. The super volatile day of the JPY interest rate change, and the most important BOE meeting minutes. I don't know if you changed the lines, or what timeframe you're on, but I'm seeing 2 entries though, and one would work. But due to the CPI. Or the 21st was the BOE meeting minues with that spike, etc. But it doesn't make a difference, I see the same thing going on either way.

Thanks so much for sharing this system with us. I started using this system in my live trading since last week Thursday and I am 117 pips richer. No losing trade using it on only GPD/USD. You are da bomb!!!

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Forexpert310. Very nice system you have developed here. I think you did develope this, at least in my limited experience I have not seen a crossover system with these indicators. Have been trading paper on the GBP/USD and CHF/USD. I like to put my stop losses a little deeper that you recommend, usally behind a fib, a PP or historic R/S. Ok course I am out around any type of news. I beleive the MACD needs to be tweaked for each pair but I have not found a meaningfull change as yet. Trying to get in a couple of pips sooner; greed is a great motivator and my worst enemy. Thanks for your work and willingness to share.

I follwed the instruction on the pouria method. I also followed other instruction on the same method. I used demo trading for testing this method. My results showed the difference between 2 instructions. I traded 2 same pairs on 30 minutes chart: EUR/USD, but the difference is stop loss: 20 pips vs 50 pips. 2/21/07 time: 6.56 am. Stop loss is 20 pips Sell 1.3127 Closed time: 8:16 am 1.3147 Loss : 20 pips 2/ 21 /07 time: 6.58 am. Stop loss is 50 pips . Sell 1.3130 Closed 2/ 22 /07 time 2:38 am. 1.3106 Profit ; 24 pips. I took profits: 4 pts. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Thanks so much for this thread. I learned a lot and it made me think and this is what I came up with.... I dont mean to hijack this thread, it has been most helpful and inspiring to me. I put up the Pouria method and also added ADX13 and MACD 3 9 1 and overlaid lsma3 over macd and then I was able to draw a parallel to when it is safe to enter and possibly get in a bit earlier and leave less of the pips on the table and this is what I came up with. ZerolaggMacd : When blue goes up through 0 its a buy When lsma is on the silver vertical bars going in the same direction as the blue line its very safe.... ( lsma is then inbetween blue line and on the silver bars) When ADX has crossed blue above red it means BUY if it trades under the dotted 25 line we are sideways ( if you enter take small profits, dont be greedy) When green line of ADX is inbetween red and blue line its very safe to trade . The trade is over when the green line goes out of blue and red line. This method gets me in a wee bit earlier and I confirm my Pouria trade with this. It means we can enter when MACD blue line crosses 0 but have a look at ADX if all 3 lines are trading under 25 then we are sideways better to stay out.. or if you have to trade... dont be greedy take 5 pips eg and run !! Making little bits adds up and that is what I like about this thread. Pink vertical line is entry and green vertical line is when I exit. ( when slope of greenADX makes a hook in the opposite direction) So basically ADX 13 with green line in between red and blue is very safe as well to trade with and possibly will add to our bag of pips at the end of the day. This Pouria example of today on GBP was a very safe trade that you could have entered with confidence. Why? Pouria gave us the signal but before we got the signal both ADX and MACD warned us that a good safe move is coming along. The young and the restless can basically enter with confidence before we actually get the Pouria signal as can be see from this screenshot. So when you get the Pouria signal then you know you will not lose ! :-) Hope you make out what I am trying to explain :-) Again thanks everyone for sharing. I would like to hear how I can make is even better. My problem always has been that I am hesitant to enter,, so when it is very safe I do it with confidence and I have less stress. This is why I like this thread so much.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I also look at Macd 3 9 6 as a exit strategy... See enclosed chart..when the red line goes out of the vertical grey lines then the move is over and I take profit ( or most of it) Again Pink vertical line is entry and green one is a good time to take the money and run. We will trade safe and be succesful.

hi forexpert310,r u still working on the pouria method II and when will u be sharing with us? thanks..

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi guys..i have been trying to figure a way how to catch both the big and small moves on Pourias method...there is no indicator in the world that can tell us when the big moves will happend!!!(sorry for my english) My idea is that with money management and with pourias method you can achieve profits...the ideas is that when the pourias theory is ready to take place i open 2 trades(i must say that this theory can be take place when the spread is 2-3,so only on major pairs guys)so open 2 trades,both trades 14 pips SL,1trade 14pip TP,second trade when reach to +14 u will change ur SL to the price that u set ur orders and let it go, maximun TP is about 25-40...dont get greedy!!! Worst case senario -28pips losses .......25% that this can happend Good case senario +14pips profits.........45% can this happend Very good case senario +54 profits.......30% can this happend RULES 1)Dont try this during news 2)Pourias method must be apply all the way 3)Do this on only 2-3 pip spread This can be apply in all major pairs!! I must thx the people that design Pouria Method And all of you that you trying to make it better!!

I understand that everybody is trying different variables, so I'm not really faulting you for that - and I'm not sure what you're T/P is. But beauty of this method - if it actually works- is the tight stop. There's a chance that you've drifted too far away from the original S/L of 14.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Forexpert's instruction on EURUSD said T/P is 15 pts.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I thought you were losing 50 pips on GBP/UDS. Nevertheless, with your risk/reward ratio of 50 / 15-20, you're going to need to win 75% of your trades to approach breaking even. Demo this method with much tighter stops.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Yes, I lost -50 pips on EURUSD. I failed to win these trades The first instruction said: 30 minutes chart T/P +15 pips S/L -14 pips (I set it for 19 pips by mistake) I lost 19 pips and 20 pips The second instruction said: 30 minutes chart T/P +20 (I won 24 pips) S/L -50 (I lost 50 pips) I lost both test trades at same time. I will test more with other pairs next week.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
I completely agree with brentmack. A moving average system depends on trend following, and if you have a take profit that is less than the stop loss, it is a sure way to lose money in the long run. Instead of waiting blindly for two lines to cross or what not, take this time to learn all you can about technical analysis and you'll be much better off in the end. While you're at it, take a look at some of the systems over here that actually have a chance of success over a long period of time. Remember, nothing is easy in forex.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
[quote=Bradone;214487] Not with multiple T/P targets. And when the span of the all 13 currency pairs is taken into consideration - this method may succeed by winning less that half of all trades. But of course we hope it performs better than that!

Yes I agree. I guess we need to try and keep this thread alive. I like this method really well with the rules that Forexpert310 set forth.....

--- 帖子 #491 ---
People tend to switch to other systems regularly, however I decided to give this system a chance and it really works. of course no system will work good if you follow the setups all the time, ie you need to have a bit of judgement. I dont trade EA's but also I use a bit of judgement. ie not enter before or immediately after news, figures etc... I encourage you to use this system but increase the stoploss to 20 pips. The RR ratio is not good but who really cares if most of the trades are winners. I increased a demo account by 17% in a month. And also I missed many good setups when I was asleep. Those that are able to trade the Asian session should also produce many pips with this system. Thank you for this great system

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I've been demoing the EA for a month. I post my results in the "Pouria EA development" thread, but here is my graph as of the close yesterday. I'm up 33.7% since I started on 2/16. http://i141.photobucket.com/albums/r...evil520/DS.gif

--- 帖子 #493 ---
you have to follow the originator/system creator's instructions to the letter. In my humble opinion, people see that the system usually produces good signals but not very frequently, so they take every signal they get and try to squeeze the maximum amount of pips out of it, and thats not the point of this system. The point here is to tilt the odds in your favor to "take the meat of the move", so to speak, meaning you are taking a small chunk everytime, 15 pip moves at the most on the yen, euro, and cable crosses but only during the usual volatile trading windows. I only trade at london and ny open and have had a win ratio of about 87% with this one, which is amazing. I also stay out of the market during news with this system. Like I said, a small chunk over and over again will add up, the problem is greed tends to take over and we lose all objectivity. I speak from experience, having blown my account a few times.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Good points. Thanks for the post. BP

--- 帖子 #495 ---
This is by far a great method, i have integrated it to my system and it works profitably. I have found that you need at least 2 or 3 methods to have successful trades. You need an entry system and you also need an exit system and make it suit your own trading style. Remember that this is not the only system that forexpert310 uses. Cheers to you all and happy trading!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I think Forexpert310 has fallen off the face of the planet. He has not contributed anything of late nor has he shown us any of his other systems. I like this system and use it. It is good for me...it is just too bad that forexpert310 chose to disappear. It is fun learning. BP

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Yes - he is definetly missed! It's a great little technique. I reeled off 15 consecutive winners through one stretch. Now the EA - that's another story!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Forexexpert310, Well, I've followed your system and am going for only 10 full pips(I'm with fxcm .com as my broker and they charge 3 pip spread) which is 7 pips profit. So, far, going on faith and using your system, I have traded 5 times in the last 3 days, all during the european session, by the way I had 3 straight trades in one european session...dammmmnnnn; and I profited with 10 pips on all my trades without any losses. I have made 35 pips in the last 3 days now. I followed one guys system whereby he uses your system but instead of going for 10 pips, he's going for 20 pips with 30 pip stop loss. Had I followed his system, I would have had 3 small losses and one potential win so far. So, I'm just sticking with your system and keeping what really works.... peace and much love brotha man, hilton

--- 帖子 #499 ---
bear, read my message below about how I'm personally doing with forexexpert's system dude. I've only been trading for a total of 3 months now and this is the first time in my life I have never loss a trade! A person, trading the european session and willing to trade the u.s session can easily average one trade daily with the eur/usd without issues and win every single time if going for only 10 full pips(7 pips profit after pip spread). And, I know for a fact that 95% percent of everyone that trades are dreaming of making 7 pips daily dude. That's 140 pips monthly and would allow me to double my account every single month without fail. And, 140 pips monthly is so conservative until it's almost a sin. peace, hilton

When you refer to the period: 85 method, does this mean 85 EMA based on the low? Do you also use the MT 4 platform? thanks for the post on the trading method. BT

--- 帖子 #501 ---
A backtest would not accurately guage this method as it relies on tading upon the cross of the MA's versus candle close. If you wait for close, you will get false signals.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
currencytrader Re: original system Just to confirm the MACD entry: for short " MACD it has to be downward" Does this translate into " MACD it has to be &lt;0" ? or just sloping downward? Also, Do you enter as the MA crosses as you see it, or do you wait for the bar/candle close to confirm, and take the trade at the next candle open?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I'll look into this more soon. THX 4 sharing.

Hi, Are people still having any success with this system. ukcool

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I'd suggest that you widen the S/L's a little bit. Not a lot - just a bit. Maybe 5 pips. Experiment with it. Then don't take every trade that's available. Use a little common sense, like trying to go with the trend rather than against it - unless there's a solid fade opportunity. See if you're in a channel of some sort, etc, etc... Just be aware of where you are - which is much more important than a couple of lines crossing each other. Frankly, I don't really use it. But I demo-ed it for a week or so and at one point had 15 winners in a row. It's not the Grail, but it should make you much more money than you lose. It's too bad that the author doesn't seem to be around any more.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Greetings, can I hear from some of you who have traded this for a long time, would you trade it anytime there is a cross, or use a time of day filter? Such as only trade NY or London session? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I've used this system and experimented with some other EMA crossovers. My best positive run was 139 trades and my second best positive run was 89. The more technical and analytical I get the shorter my positive runs are. I always return to this system for encouragement, confidence and to renew my foundations. Sometimes I think this is too simple so off I go looking into new ideas. This is a good place to start. Remember the traders goal is To Make A Profit.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Great job Asyi, What set up do you use and what broker. Can this system be modified to work with the daily charts. It's hard to watch the PC all day long for a cross. Any suggestions would be helpful Thanks Billser

--- 帖子 #509 ---
First of all I'm a day trader but I only trade from 08:30 to around 13:00 EST on days that have news coming out. I check FF for whats coming up. Your right about the crossover of 75 &amp; 85, they do take some time to develop. So what I do is set up a 5 ema on a 5 min chart and a 21 ema. One is yellow and the other green. My 75 &amp; 85 are still red. I also throw in a 50 sma usually blue. The 5 and 21 has to cross the 50 if its a valid trade. I trade off of a DealBook 360 platform from GFT. I have a live account with them but mostly I use their charts. I can see three to six at a time and switch to different time frames depending upon when the crossover took place. If I missed a 5 min crossover I'll look on the 15 to see if it is still valid. Some crossovers, depending upon the trend, can be valid all the way to a 4 hr and even daily chart. I execute trades on FXCM platform. I've been live with them for about three years. But, I never trade NFP. I also have a live account with Oanda I sometimes use. OK. Your looking at the 5 min chart. You want to see a candle bridge the space between the 5 ema and the 21 ema. It must open and close touching the two emas in order for it to be a bridge. After you see the bridge, for the next five minutes, watch the 5 ema, it will cross the 21 either up or down. I'll enter the trade with a two or three pip confirmation on the next candle. Now I'm looking for that 5 ema to head for the 50 sma and then cross the 75 and 85 with the 21 ema following right behind. I place a 9 pip stop loss on every trade. After a nice run of 10 pips I usually exit the trade and if the trade hasn't gone to at least 20 pips by 14:30 - I'm out. But the trade may develope on the G/U, E/U, U/J, U/C or any pairs you care to monitor, sometime between 8:30 and 13:00. My goal is 20 pips a day but I'll vary my lot size depending upon other confirmations. My MACD is set at 6, 12, 9. My buy signal must be above 0. And a sell signal must be below 0. I always trade in the direction of the prevailing trend. Except for last week when I got real qute and shorted the U/J for a -130. I won't mention how many lots except to say I won't be doing that again. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hey asyi, Have you consistently hit your 20 pip target everyday using your system?? How much do you average a month. I'm trying to find a good way to trade the New York Session. Thanx J. Stone

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi Dunlop432, Twenty pips off of crossovers on days that have better than expected or worse than expected news is usually no problem. Yesterday and today were non-news days on the New York open so I wasn't trading except for 5 pips I wrung out of U/J. Here's are several ways to trade the New York open using a modified Pouria System. This is one someone sent me that I find works on New York News with the G/U. On a 15 min chart draw a line from the close of the 03:15 candle to the close of the 08:15 candle. That candle closes at 08:30 so that is when you would draw the line. Enter your trade at 08:45 in the direction of the 08:45 candle, I usually wait for about 2 pips to make sure of the direction. If the 08:30 candle is a doji - do not trade. If the 8:30 candle is over 50 pips do not trade. If the 08:15 and 08:30 candle are the same do not trade. If the spread of the 08:15 candle is 10 pips or less do not trade. At 08:45 when you enter your trade if the candle goes in the direction of the line you may be looking at quite a few pips. If nothing happens by 09:00 try to exit the trade at a break even point. Next you want some kind of validation or confirmation. Go to a 5 minute chart and see if you have a bridge with a crossover, next look at your MACD using 6,12, 9 and see if there is a crossover. Your trade will go in the direction that all the confirmations are suggesting. Double check with a 12, 26, 9 and then check the trade with a MACD of 19, 39, 9 before closing, that will give you an exit signal. Do your looking on the 5 min but do your trading on the 15 min, this will help elliminate any whipsaw effect. Always know what your prevailing trend is and never trade against it. Always backtest any system. And don't believe anything until you have proven it to yourself.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I'm a bit puzzled as to why this method uses 2 ma lines, the same colour. Firstly, why two? Unless I am going to utilise the crossover as an aid I would only see the need for one. If I was going to use the crossover, then surely different colours would be more helpful?

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hey asyi, Thanks for the reply. I will definitely manual backtest some charts based on your strategy. J. Stone

I really love the concept of this system. How do you keep track of all the pairs over the 24 hour market? Are you setting up an indicator to alert you when the cross happens... maybe by SMS or something? Thanks. Damon Decker

On page 1 there is a list of all the pairs and the time frames for maximum pips using the Pouria method. I would recommend using pairs you are familiar with around the hours of news releases. It is usually after these news releases that crossovers are most likely to occur. This system is based on moving average crossovers combined with a MACD crossover using 15,26 and 1. Using the Pouria system when the shorter (faster) MA advances above the longer (slower) MA a buy signal occurs. A sell signal would be given when the shorter MA crosses below the longer MA. The speed of the system and the number of signals generated will depend on the length of the MAs. The Pouria system is a very slow system. But, you only have to watch those pairs that are beginning to show sighs of a pending crossover. I never trade on a crossover alone. I wait for confirmation on the MACD and then trade on the next candle. You may be able to pick up more pips on a crossover breakout of 5 ema and 21 ema but these shorter MAs generate more false signals. 5, 75 &amp; 85 is much safer. If you went with a 21 ema, 50 sma, 100 sma, 200 sma on a G/U 60 min chart you would have gone long at 1.9700 on 6/15. Remember that the shorter the time frame the more signals you are going to get. The longer time frames are more reliable because they take into account a lot more information. And the crossovers only occure once a week or once every two weeks and sometimes only once in a blue moon. So there really isn't any need for an alert system unless your really anxious to lose your money.

Just updating the pdv indicator with the ability change the ma setting and time frame ask requested by a few people. This has not been tested on real time data yet, so please use with caution. Good Luck Trading....

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Found a few mistake.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I tried this system, it has some interesting features It needs some modification as can lead you astray when yellow cross the red lines not deeply. It is useful to extend it to other time frames too

--- 帖子 #519 ---
It's really useful ... thanks

--- 帖子 #520 ---
this system is soooo damn simple and i've been making winning trades using my live manual account (no EA). damn damn simple. try it or regret it. im so convinced with the confidence of the thread starter. apparently he's so confident himself that he doesnt even put SL hahahaha. kudos to you dude.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Psyber85 would you be willing to detail exactly how you trade this system? What currencies, timeframe, indicators, exit strategy, etc? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi there! ok I've been using this fixed system for all my trades and so far it has been positive. (sorry i cant show figures or charts because im trading on live and im combining many strategies for my tradings) Anyway, I followed EXACTLY what treadstarter has indicated on his very first post. everything exactly - the currency pair and when to get out. (im sure he has done a thorough study on them, and those who complain reaping too little pips from the recommended limits, do try other settings at your own risk. you want to profit more, simple. just add more lots.) Entry: When the yellow is CONFIRMED crossed the 2 red lines, enter at the open of the next candle. Use the timeframe as specified on the first thread. Example shown below. (Click to enlarge) http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/8...uriaev1.th.png Exit: 14 pips SL, as stated on the first trade. With the range of currencies you can trade on, you wont be afraid of running out of excitement. Use other strategies too to make more pips and to keep occupied!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
OK thank you very much. One other question, do you add spread on to the 14 pip stop loss, or not?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
for me i didnt. it's your choice i guess. try it out and smoothen the strategy out on your own!

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I just found an excellent strategy tester for free, which has accurate data and you can test all kinds of strategies. I tested Pouria on Eur/Usd and it lost 655 pips in 18 months. So I tested on Cable and it lost 620 pips, though if I optimized it to -15 pip stop loss and +80 pip target it gained 225. But if I changed the timeframe to 60 minutes instead of 30 it lost nearly 1000 pips. Then I tested it on USD/CHF and it lost over 1000 pips. USD/JPY lost 1500 pips I'm done with this now.

Trust your eyes and the charts. The timing of entry is rather crucial for this strategy - the riding of the trend. If you'd really observed carefully watching past charts, most actually garnered profits. Catching the first candle is rather important. And most importantly, your eyes will show you that after the cross of the yellow over the red, the trend will follow in that direction for many many many more pips to come. trust your eyes!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
btw, im a "day" trader (it's at night at my location while GMT's in the day.) so i guess this is pretty much for those who've time to observe the markets.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
SL hit 14 pips. good gauge before it went up all the way sky high and flushed my account... USD/CHF - M30 PL: 10 Pips SL: 14 Pips http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/4084/slgy5.th.png i'll try to update my progress here if i have the free time...anyone please feel free to give comments or advice...

--- 帖子 #529 ---
What session are you finding these trades occur? Are you trading the NY open and session?? (I ask b/c I trade London.) Thanks! Damon Decker

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi, I have just joined this forum and don't know much about forex trading. So anyone there to give me good methods which will help me learn as well as earn.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I Love this system....best one I can understand..however using Finspreads to try and get optimum pips is driving me crAZY!!!!! Last few days, when you use your computer to try and enter, and also exit, system freezes, like someone on other end is determined to stop you having a position, in fact sometimes minutes before Fins responds. By that time slippage is awful and you are now in negative territory, either entering or exiting or even both. Anyone give me an alternative broker to use, preferably not in the USA, but in UK, that operates almost instantaneously, Fins is operating against you all the time. Thanks for your time. PS. Yesterday whilst having to use phone with them they said (YET AGAIN) that they didnt take trades on that number - even tho they had been in previous weeks......all a delaying tactic methinks!!!

Hi everyone. This is my first post on FXF. I've been lurking and testing for a few months now and have settled on my system which I am about to begin trading on my live a/c. I like the Pouria method and have been playing around with it, dropping out the macd and mavs but ended up coming back to pretty much what is described at the beginning of this thread. After doing a couple of all nighters I realised what I knew from the start; I can't trade 24/7. I'm not much good at using the computer so I can't post a chart or I would.This is what I am going to do: I'll enter on a confirmed cross of the 5wma over the 75/85 mavs set on low for a long, and the same for shorts set on the highs of the 75/85 with MACD confirmed cross of its waterline. My chart has the 2 tunnels set up on it all the time, blue for longs, red for shorts. Risk management is to have 2 lots or multiples there of. For both lots i have a stoploss of 30 pips including spread trailed by 10.Once 20 pips in profit, 1 lot is left at breakeven until the 5 wma crosses the opposite tunnel for an exit. the other lot, once 20 pips ahead is left with the 10 pip trail. I think the Pouria method is great and has to be used with good technical analysis.ie. patterns, sup and res.fibs. I am just going to trade off an hourly chart with refference to higher timeframes. I welcome any feedback on what Ive just written.Cheers.

Bogus; Nice Post. Seems like you have a well thought out and detailed strategy. The only thing I see missing is some data on how this has worked on both back testing and forward testing. It's a strange thing how differences appear between what your mind see's in "back testing" and what actually happens in forward testing on a demo account. I look forward to your future reports.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Good luck Bogus. I would like to see your progress and that of ar1002 and mercury7. Thanks to all for your comments. BearPaw

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Thanks. The risk management isn't what you'd call statistically optimal, but it's what I can live with. It gives me a chance at the bigger moves plus hopefully locking in small gains. I use the Pouria method as the core to enter a trade and eveything else to keep me out. To back test it thoroughly would take years, I haven't kept figures. I've been fiddling with different T.P's, using trailing stops at different settings and have decided to settle on the above post for now. I think by going live and sticking to my plan I should do ok. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi - does anyone have an EA for the Pouria system that just generates an email alert when the conditions are met (i.e. just sends an email but doesn't issue a trade instruction) ? - thanks in anticipation

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Thank you so much for the post , it really help , but i still need more assistance on the MACD , do i have to put it close or where? Please email me back , i really need your help. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi, everyone :-) Actually i have been reading forexfactory forum quite some time... And had learn alot about forex... Hmmm, i abit sad to say that this thread has been very quiet. And i hope that this thread will carry on to discuss more into how to make this trading system better... I had tried using forexexpert method, my demo account has been increasing steadily...of course money management is still a very important factor in winning pips. Thats all i have to say, i really do hope this thread will not die so soon :-)

--- 帖子 #539 ---
This method is very good with a high hit rate. Since I last posted I got frustrated with taking small profits and waiting for the good set ups. I now trade using the Cornflower method, it just suits me better. The Pouria method is one I would recommend to anyone. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
agreed with that...alot of patience is needed.... :-)

--- 帖子 #541 ---
This is a nice system where you can scalp the market and win 10-15 pips very easily. It's also good on the GBP/JPY on the 30 minute or hourly chart and sometimes you can have some nice 40 pip runs. Very good. Good for 80% success rate and for traders of all experience or little experience. Paris

--- 帖子 #542 ---
i had also tried it at 1 hour time frame...and i done badly...maybe my patience is not that good :-) will try lower time frame :-)

--- 帖子 #543 ---
has anyone made an ea with alerts for all the pairs using the origninal sysytem and its original sl and tp??

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi, was reading most of the posts but it seems that the thread died. Why? Is this system not working anymore? Did they go to another forum? Please let me know. Thanks Antomi

--- 帖子 #545 ---
How to interpret this move? stay away from short?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
SL 14, TP 20

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I always thought NU as a jerk - always hit my SL. But look here, again a perfect trade.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
damn it, another winner!

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hi ,why all guys disappeared from here ? Anyway i am still in in this nice trade. I use SL of 30 pips and no limit, i close when i see that macd ma are turning.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Good morning I am trying to find information POURIA if the method actually works in that currency pair is going better and times of the candles and hoped that if the yellow line through the two red and sailing off to go there before closing the wing or if anyone knows any estratejia for the POURIA agree with me that I would like to thank Information

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Forexpert310, thank you for sharing the great system. I love this system , It is really a great, safe scalping system . There are still a lot of reentering chances combined with other metholds after the yellow line crosses the red lines. Great job!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi anyone using this system for live account ?? I plan to trade it on 1k account. what stoploss and target i should keep in mind while entering into any trade ?? it will great to share the live experience with someone who is already practising this method. rgds, Sandy

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Why nobody discuss about this thread anymore? Anybody still use this method? or EA? I've read it all, looks simple and worked for many. I guess Pouria Method II never released. Any Idea?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Thank's FOREXEPERT!!! great system posted by a great member

--- 帖子 #555 ---
how can it be construed.enter143,30 close 143,13. macd doesnt breach zero line.yes its true.but ma's may make false move.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Nice System, Thanks for sharing. :-)

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Thanks a million! your method`s realy good but pay respect to the current spreads of my broker + speed_abilities of the pairs i prefer to use 4Н TF. and of sure since 2007 lots of things have changed so i change the rules + indicators` sets in other way. but meanwhile 90% accuracy what was the core_concept is still alive. good luck &amp; thank you again

--- 帖子 #558 ---
hi RangeFX, would you please explain how do you change the rules and indicators? or can you share a new manual for this system? is it work on 15M or 30M or 1H ? tnx.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Anyone still use this method? It works? Thx

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Some don't use a stop but its advisable. System been working for 14 years now

--- 帖子 #85 ---
MackS10 that's amazing. If you still trade it, what's your preferred timeframe. is it the default ones specified in the first post? thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yes same the stop is just beyond the nearest swing. Tp is most visible SR. However trade off higher tf 1h+. The cross can also be used in both daily and weekly for a sense of price direction.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
It’s very amusing, really. There’s nothing worth 30 pages here, folks: it’s just yet another moving average crossover, but dressed up as having a very high win-rate simply because it has tiny targets and huge stop-losses. The thread-starter even initially said he doesn’t even use a stop-loss at all, and that tells you all you need to know: he naturally has “expert” in his username and doesn’t post any more, but his sig-file advertises a “managed account” for which the all-time result is displayed as -99.9%!!
