First a thank you to Old Dog for graciously providing the formulas for a strategy he has been successfully trading for some time. The point of this thread, to develop that strategy for EURUSD and to see if it might be portable to other pairs. The trading strategy has roots in Fibonacci and it not intended to be traded with other indicators. Any introduction of other indicators that do not relate directly to the purest form of this trading approach will get you banned from posting on this thread. Any disrespectful commentary will get you banned from this thread. Generally being an ass and not making a positive contribution to the thread will get you banned. I'm taking a lead from Steve Hopwood's threads and will be ruthless about this!!! Please read the above paragraph again. The strategy relies on two pieces of data..a base level and a phase and then daily calculations for a variety of ways to enter and exit trades. Indicator development presumes the use of FXPro as a broker. Discussions about broker times and differences due to different feeds will be deleted. Please download an FXPro demo. Here is Why - Post #91 __________________________________________________ OLD DOG'S FORMULAS D is the daily close and M is the midpoint of a fib calculation (more on that as the thread progresses) 0.6747 * D + 0.3280 * M 0.6743 * D + 0.3255 * M __________ 0.2502 * D + 0.751 * M 0.6735 * D + 0.3234 * M 0.3349 * D + 0.6745 * M 0.6676 * D + 0.3394 * M 0.3336 * D + 0.6696 * M 0.3519 * D + 0.6489 * M 0.6743 * D + 0.3255 * M 0.2966 * D + 0.6973 * M 0.3328 * D + 0.6632 * M 0.3286 * D + 0.6648 * M 0.3320 * D + 0.6585 * M D is the "daily close" and M is the 50% fib level. Remember : do BOTH multiplies first, THEN add results. ______________________________________________ Logical first steps: 1. Develop an indicator to identify the current daily Old Dog levels to trade 2. Collect the necessary indicators to identify fib levels for the chart 3. Work on a way to calculate the base 4. Work on a way to calculate the phase range See Post #38 5. Develop a variety of trading styles from this approach I'll do my best to provide a summary to important links on this post. For now there is one voucher required to post. That will be eventually removed. I can add you as a buddy if you need to post. Now let's do something productive from the ashes of Abonacci . (EDIT - Abonacci resurrected from the ashes. Good luck to them!)

Thanks you guys, signed up! About cosmetic idea for so many lines? I think we could display those FIBO lines with very little color, well depends on template of course.. And those Old_Dog lines with more color, So FIBO lines should be kind of on the second plan also make them very thin, that should work.

Ideally, the indicator would draw those lines that I have on my chart...by reading what phase we are in and using the NY close and doing the old dog calculations. My understanding of the phase is that it's whever the close is...that is the phase we are in. That interpretation is subject to change. The squalou script was good...as it displays well on a white background and then the Old Dog trades could be Red for sell and Blue for buy with the TP lines in Green....all customizeable colors and a bit thicker lines. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I am interested in this thread and am intrigued with Old Dog's calculations here. Thanks for starting the thread. Also, I am interested in what stimpy has to say here. BTW in answer to Old Dog's statement that he is not a Guru; Remember the Buddha proverb, " If you meet the (Guru, my addition) Buddha on the road, kill him." I take that to mean there is no Guru. We are the only ones who experience our life and who ultimately must take responsibility for it. I thank Old Dog for posting his ideas here and for his humility. I gave him a vouch, based on his statement about his trading and from what I have read in his posts.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I would like to post my thanks in advance for starting a new clean thread for everyone to learn and share ideas together while developing the trading system into something even greater than it already appears to be.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
It'll give it less visibility and fewer visits. That may be good. If you would like, a couple of us can appeal to Twee to move it back. I don't know if it would do any good, but he might reconsider.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I have sent Twee a note..but you are right. Fewer visits probably good as we are still trying to sort things out. Matters not to me. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thank you for starting this new thread! I wish we can all help each other and become better traders. Let us be respectful for the elderly and the more experienced traders. Without that, we have no chance to move forward! regards fxtsun ___________________________________ "And, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make." The Beatles

Indicator development - I would see the Big Dog calculations as one option and the Blue-White fib calculations as another option....maybe two separate indicators? Maybe someone could comment re how they have been using the blue/white fib combo...I have not. That may help squalou or others integrate that as an option in any indicator. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi folks... Thanks for accepting me CanuckCT. Hope we can learn something fruitful from experienced traders on this thread. Folks, learn to appreciate others' ideas and opinion before throwing any comments... Cheers !

Great work canuck.. this is kind of approach is well appriciated in this forum community rather than hidden formula. Thanks goes to old dog too.. .. nice work..

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Presumably everything the indicator draws can have its colors changed. So if you wanted no fibs, you could change the color to "none".

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I am posting another indicator with two functions, you can see and compare the two. In this you can even disappear with this rectangle and leave only the contour

Hi all, sooooo... Here is my first attempt for this indicator that we are all waiting for... Put it to your experts/indicators folder, compile with MetaEditor, or shutdown+reload MT4 (auto-compiles whatever is "new"). August, September and October levels are hardcoded, maybe we'll be able to add december (and beyond) as well... Special Thanks: - to Aebab for having shared his system and opened a whole new vision in trading - to OldDog who revealed his 25-years winning Calculator - to CanuckCT for opening the new thread - to future contributors who do not have their names here yet, but i know some names that could be added here soon if they mind contributing so this thread can survive in december... Let's see what this first attempt looks like, give me your remarks, and we'll go forward! What it has now: - Aebab's Phases and mid (yellow) fibs, as in the Script i posted in Aebab's thread, - OldDog calculation breakout levels for each day: - blue "Pivot" line - 2 green "stripes" for the 2 high (buy) breakout+target zones - 2 pink "stripes" for the 2 low (sell) breakout+target zones - i did NOT draw the "sentiment" line yet; Shall I ? - i removed the "74pips Closing Fib" that were in the script -- irrelevant at this stage of the indicator development; the code is still there, so we can easily reactivate it in the future. - it is not yet optimized... so it will redraw ALL phases of ALL months every time it detects a new phase has formed... Sorry Canuck, i just thought those stripes would be visually more attractive than thick lines. I may be wrong, but it does look nice on my chart! Be sure to use a light (white) background again -- no black. - make sure you have adjusted "NY_Close_hour" according to your brokerz timezone, it is currently set to "23" which is for GMT+2/DST; What is unsure as of now: - i don't know yet if it will follow price action properly for extending the Phases when price breaks out to a new Phase up or down; - i don't know if it will properly draw the new daily OldDog zones when NY closing bell rings... This is because markets are closed now, so i can't feed the indicator with new ticks until monday... Remarks wellcome! A possible way of trading this: - open 2 buystop trades and 2 sellstop trades at the beginning of the day: one for each "stripe"; - go out to work, bar, sailing, whatever, - come back at NY close, and enjoy your banked pips! Questions: - what SL ? - TP: 2 options (at least): - option 1: set TP to the Target of each stripe; - option 2: set TP of BOTH trades to Target2, and TRAIL Trade1 once it has reached TP1, so that you bank the pips between stripe1 and stripe2... (now: what trail distance ?...) Just a thought... SQ

Hey Squalou, An excellent start! Cheers CanuckCT

My initial thoughts.... Sunday Data Not sure what to do with that extra hour or two on Sunday on some brokers...my thinking is to have an option to include this with Monday. So Friday's NY close would be used and Sunday would be treated at extras hours on Monday. Three strategies I think there are at least 3 trading strategies in play here. Here is how I see it. Old Dog Targets This is what you have now...I wouldn't change it...except maybe to put a price label somewhere on the top and bottom of those green and pink areas and to provide whatever Old Dog thinks is appropriate. NYCloseBreakoutFib There is a 74 pip fib breakout from NY close...initially, this number could be entered manually but someone had provided a suggestion of how it is derived....so can automate this...may want to leave room for that. A pic of that looks like this Attached Image (click to enlarge) Some rules of what to do with this will follow from someone I hope. ReversalFib This is an entire trading strategy on it's own...one I never spent much time on. But here goes. Anyone feel free to correct me. Draw blue fib from 23.6 phase above to 50% fib in current phase. Draw a second blue fib from 23.6 fib in current phase to 50% fib in phase below. Now draw a third fib from the 100% on the top fib to the 61.8% level on the bottom fib...reversals are at the 38.2 level on the third fib...boxes I've highlighted. Two ways to deal with change in direction....for now I've drawn the same fibs for the previous phase which was below the current phase....and marked the 38 fib level as well. There is one more way to draw that lower fib...but that can be later if necessary. A picture is much easier to understand...so here is is. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Confusion To have these three strategies on one chart creates confusion. I suggest the indicator only allow one of the three on a single chart. 1 - Old Dog 2 - NY Fib breakout 3 - Reversal Fib Then everyone can pick their poison....and 3 EURUSD charts is not asking for too much to look at. Maybe a static label at the top that indicates what trading strategy the indicator is displaying. With the 3 strategies, lots of reasons to trade. Like someone said...put enough fibs on a chart and something is likely to hit. 2.368 Phases I believe there was a thought that if 2.368 phases for the month were met, then price would continue to at least Phase 4. So that seems to be a prominent level for us to consider and should be here somewhere regardless of which of the 3 strategies is displaying. That's all I have for now. Very nice work Squalou. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I have had a couple of people indicating they have been able to calculate the base level and the phases...so hopefully that information will be forthcoming soon. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yes. For now, can you also draw a vertical line on the last bar of the NY close....and then a horizontal line at the closing price that displays only on the current day. That will allow for some debugging of the calculations. Cheers CanuckCT

Hello, I have used, and written, many indicators over the years that require daily data, and this whole stupid business of Sundays causes endless problems! Some indy's have an "IgnoreSunday" flag which sometimes doesn't work. The simple fact is, the FX market is open for EXACTLY five days, 0000 on Monday to 2359 on Friday. So, in the UK for example, it appears to open at 2100 or 2200 (GMT/BST) and other times elsewhere. This is why I will only EVER use data from a broker with a GMT+3 feed. Then there is never a "Sunday". The market opens 0000 Monday and closes Friday. Although I trade thru a spread bet house (there is no tax whatever in the UK on trading like this), I always use a proper GMT+3 broker for reference purposes. IMPORTANT: You have all seen that I tend to confirm trades (and certainly estimate risk for MM purposes) using Price Action. Of course, hourly and faster candles should be pretty much the same everywhere, but H4 and Daily candles are NOT THE SAME if the broker time offset is different! You get MUCH BETTER price action signals on a GMT+3 broker! Be wary of using PA on high speed charts. The longer the TF, the more accurate the PA (in general). Regards Old Dog

Guys, This strategy is certainly extensible to other pairs, but only those that behave in a "technical" way. EU works fine - it has to as it is so large and liquid. EU is 70% of the FX market! Cable (GU) is also excellent, as it is the most "technical" of the pairs. I don't know why this is, but it just is. Personally, I trade only EU and GU. I would love this stragegy to work on the really volatile pairs like GBPJPY as it would make money even faster! But it doesn't work. Believe me, I have tried! Bobi also talked about using his ideas on Oil (WTI in most brokers). I cannot get this to work as Oil is (a) too volatile and (b) too manipulated a market. Best regards Old Dog PS. When I say "It doesn't work", what I mean is "I can't get it to work". That doesn't mean it can't be done. It just means that I can't do it....

Hi... Seeking your permission Squalou... I have just changed only the "color" for black background... hope you wouldn't mind. TQ &amp; Cheers !

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thats great to hear! @squalou good job on the indies! Just one question..When i switch the TF the MT ask me if i want to stop the indicator. Should i open a new chart for each TF i need?

[quote = Old_Dog ; 4066711 ] Olá, O simples fato é , o mercado Forex é aberto por exatamente cinco dias , 0000 a 2359 na segunda-feira sexta-feira. Embora o comércio através de uma casa de apostas espalhados (não há qualquer imposto no Reino Unido no comércio como este) , eu uso sempre um bom corretor GMT +3 para fins de referência . Old Dog [/ quote] I think we need to establish a rule for the system as there is a big difference between brookers

Hello, To help those who are coding the indicators for us over the weekend, this post contains the detailed instructions on computing the phase gap by my method. I have to say, I have some serious concerns about Bobi's method. As it happens, for Sept he and I got the same result of 127 pips. Then for October, he posted that he had calculated a value of 82 pips, but then for some vague reasons he "didn't like the answer" and arbitrarily changed it back to 127. Phase gap must, by definition, be a function of volatility, which is itself stochastic. We cannot expect the same phase gap in a slow month (like Oct usually is) as in a trending month (like Sept usually is). Anyway, here is my method in detail: (1) Open a clean EURUSD D1 chart. (2) We are going to measure volatility using Average True Range (ATR). So from the Indicator menu select ATR and add an ATR(44) to your chart. Why 44, I hear you say! Because there is an average of 22 trading days per month and I take the last two months. (3) Say it is Sept 1 today and we want the Sept value. Look back over the ATR(44) curve and find the PEAK value over the last 2 months. On my chart with my GMT+3 broker, this occurred on 1 July with a value of 0.0186 or 186 pips. (4) Now imagine drawing the PDF histogram of the ATR in this interval. You will get a bell-curve. (OK, volatility is not Normally distributed as it exhibits some heteroskedasticity, but the Normal assumption is near enough for our purposes). The 186 pip PEAK value will lie at each end. (5) Now it is a fact that 1 standard deviation contains 68.3% of the data on a bell-curve. So we multiply 186 pips by 0.683 and we get 127 pips as the phase gap. The October phase gap is not the same in my system! My peak ATR value in Aug/Sept is 0.0146 or 146 pips. Taking 68.3% of this gives me 100 pips as the phase gap for October. I suspect Bobi's first results were nearer the truth! In general, we would not expect as much volatility in October as in September. This can now be added very easily by the coders to indicators, templates and EA's for the benefit of all. Best regards Old Dog

How do we calculate the Monthly Base line to start the Fibonacci line? Thanks, Prakash

here are the Range values as calculated using OldDog fomulae: 2010.10.02 16:11:55 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 EURUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.10.01=99.6p 2010.10.02 16:11:55 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 EURUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.09.01=127.7p 2010.10.02 16:11:55 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 EURUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.08.01=127.7p 2010.10.02 16:11:55 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 EURUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.07.01=127.1p As you can see, this is very close to Aebab figures for Aug and Sep. Even July has 127p as well. Now, depending on how we round these values, we would either get 127,127,127, 99 , or 127, 128,128,100. Does this matter so much ? If i keep the actual range value as calculated above instead of rounding it up or down, i get a Phase.8Up for September at 1.3666 (127.7p) instead of 1.3661 (127.0p). Only 5 pips in 8 phases. slightly more than HALF a pip per Phase. Is that so important ?... I'll keep the exact value for now. Out of curiosity, i ran it on GBPUSD : 2010.10.02 16:30:59 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 GBPUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.10.01=124.5p 2010.10.02 16:30:59 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 GBPUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.09.01=124.5p 2010.10.02 16:30:59 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 GBPUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.08.01=119.9p 2010.10.02 16:30:59 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 GBPUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.07.01=111.1p 2010.10.02 16:30:59 sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi-sep-oct2010 GBPUSD ,H1: OldDogRange for 2010.06.01=115.1p SQ

We must be vigilant if we use the phase 100 pips, we've already reached 100% of phase current and phase if we use 127 pips 11 are still missing. I believe that the month of October is less volatile than in September. I put two graphs to track which stage is the most acceptable.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
stimpy Temporarily Suspended by Senior Member yes we did find the formula. well i did.... we never claimed we were from your system. and the base is 3675 not 3673. as i sent to you at 16:25 GMT 30/08/10 on skype - you can check "[30/09/2010 17:02:48] francisfinley: 367# 355# 342#" which was 3929 3802 3675 3548 3421 in 127 phases - getting to your 82 was done by your hand or is that half the story? POST #1231 ABBONACCI If anyone of us have contacts with him, maybe he tell BaseLevel formula.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I have a spreadsheet that calculates the base...it will be several hours before I can get to it to review. Film at 11 Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #48 ---
the most fiat currency, i love it too....our whole economy is finance since manufacturing was outsource,, so that could have the effect of making GU the most technical, just my opinion nice logic OD regarding being weary of the phase gap calculations. imo bobi's behaviour regarding the switching from 82 to 127 was quite telling

--- 帖子 #49 ---
It would be nice when we refine that script, if someone actually create Screenshot of that template and point out where are those Buy/Sell TP levels Too many lines/levels can lead into confusion. Thank you.

Here is a version of the indi that will draw daily BO and TP lines and prices on top of the green/pink OldDog zones... And it also draws a vert live at "today NY Close" to spot when the show is on... And the Sentiment in green. I found out that OldDog's formulaes for low BO2 and Target2 where switched... I put them back in the correct order. I also let the EXACT Phase Range values as calculated with ATR(daily,44,last 2 months), meaning 127.7p for august and september, and 99.6p for october. Although the chart will show the nearest rounded value (128/100). SQ

Has anyone had any confirmation on how the second and third set of fibs are drawn in a falling market? Currently, all the fibs are being drawn from top downwards, is this the case when we fall below the starting monthly pivot? Does it not stand to reason that these should be reversed? Also.... On another note, does anyone currently in this group re-calculate on an intraday basis? Some of the best results I have had have come from recalculating on a swing high or low (retraces). This ties in nicely with my current strategy, so I can understand if many have not done it. Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Lee, Perhaps you could expand a little on how you use the recalc...something based on recent swing hi and lo does makes some sense as it reflect current price action. One of the points of the point of the thread is to discuss some options, and that is one we have not yet discussed. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Makes sense...care to post a pic? Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Try prior month hi-lo divide by 10, there is your NY breakout range pip value for the month. Seems arbitrary enough! Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I don't have any pictures or examples to post, but as you will see from Bobi's original post. The only examples given show all fibs being drawn from top to bottom which, as we have moved through this market, is all we have had to do, we have not dropped into a negative phase since he released this. However, there has been no indication from anyone (at least that I have seen) which says they should or should not be drawn the same way. Now we are in a new month, we are VERY close (or we were ) to the baseline. We (meaning all of us) are assuming they are drawn the same way, from top down, but is that the case? It's more a case of just being aware of it than anything else. The answer may already be out there....... It doesnt make much difference to the lines, but it will to the figures we look for breaks and reversals of. Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thank you SQ, I think other parameter should be in place there "GMT_Offset" Because on my screen it shown lines at 23 GMT and my broker has GMT + 2, so those lines should be drawn 2 hours earlier.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Lee, Nothing here seems to be related to what this thread is about. Do you post in the wrong place? Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Out of interest..... anyone read the new updated first post from Bobi?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hey, That was in response to your question about me providing a little more informaiton on when/how I recalc. I was just giving some background. Bobi has stated (I will try to find where) that you can recalculate (use the calculator) at any time during the day. You substitute the close of the previous day for the close of the most recent candle (swing low/high in my case). In doing this, you get a new breakout figure and a target. As I said, just explaining the reason behind 'when' I do it. Is that clearer or do you still think it's irrelevant? If so, I am happy to remove it..... if i still can. Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Ryder Cup has my attention at the moment. I think the post is off topic a bit and adds a bit of confusion. For general info, four traders have suggested to me that baseline is merely a fib calculation and that makes total sense to me. More later. Back to golf. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Removed.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I may be wrong, but the discussion still needs to be a bit over the baseline values. Well see if this value is incorrect template is all wrong. If the range is 100 pips, should also change the baselevel, which would not be more because this value is 1.3673 over a range of 127 pips. Am I correct?

Hello, squalou It is almost certainly my fault being a silly old codger!! I was cutting and pasting lines from the C++ source code so I probably cut and pasted into the wrong place with that formula. Thanks for spotting the error and for all the work on the indicators. Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #66 ---
well, NY closes at 23 GMT+2, right ? So these settings seem correct to me. SQ

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Yes. And I must say I am getting increasingly concerned about that "system". There are so many rules now, and so may exceptions to those rules, that the system cannot "fail" as there is always a get-out clause. I am afraid I don't have a lot of faith in the original system now. The arbitrary change of the phase gap from 127 to 82 then back to 127 was the last straw. All we need is a simple system with: (1) A monthly/weekly baseline (2) A consistent and logically derived Phase Gap (3) A simple calc to use the recent close plus the mid-phase value to give simple buy and sell levels. Simple, consistent, reliable and TESTABLE!! Regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #68 ---
So true, - thanks a lot, Old Dog, for your support.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Ok, SQ as Market is closed now, will check it out later.. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Squalou...can you check that it uses the closing price of the hourly candle. I'm getting some differences in the calculations for Old Dog's calculator and your calculations. Cheers CanuckCT EDIT - ignore this, I'll rephase my question.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Agree! Anything beyond this is more than we need. I have suggested a couple of other features for the indicator, only so they might be reviewed for potentials to achieve what OD has mentioned above. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Nothing interesting there for me..unless you can point it out. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I agree with you completely. We should leave that system in the other thread and concentrate strictly on what you do. If we try to accommodate both we'll wind up with all the bogus and crackpot variations that ruined that other thread.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Sorry chaps, despite the title of this thread I 'thought' we were still taking Bobi's stuff and trying to develop it along side OD's. My bad........ Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I am completly agree with Old Dog I think bobi's thread is getting too complex to understand. We should concentrate more on this thread and Old Dog's guide line CanuckCT if you can post the development of creating the indicator in the first post based on the 1 2 3 point Old Dog mentioned that would be great .. I am sure you have already done that probarbly but as OD said.. First Step : Monthly Weekly base line 2nd Step : Phase Gap 3rd Step : Use the calculator to get the Buy/Sell entry point. OD if you don't mind would you please tell us about how to get monthly and weekly base line is it another calculation? Thanks HoiChoi

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Whatever is happening on that other thread can stay there. We may look at some of the concepts to see if they have merit, but will not be accepting things blindly. A trader just posted that "You can't imagine that everything is pre-determined".....that's a pretty scary comment about forex and you won't find that here. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Downloaded OD's calculator from post #1 but it wont run. Running Vista. Anyone else having trouble? Also thanks to Canuck and OD (and other contributors)for the work you're doing.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
The baseline "calculation" is all that is missing. Whereas the Phase Gap must be a single, fixed value, and I have already explained in detail how to find this ( or at least, how I find it ), the problem of the baseline is not so easy to reduce to a formula because it can take multiple values. To explain what I mean, say we had a Phase Gap of 100 pips. Someone might suggest a Baseline of 1.3200, someone else might calculate 1.3300, yet another might insist on 1.3500, and so on. All of these are the "right" answer because the phase grid would coincide with all of them. The baseline serves to "anchor" the grid and so can take the value of any phase line. I don't think I am speaking out of turn when I say that several of us are working behind the scenes to resolve the best way to determine this. Please bear with us until we can report a significant result. This is probably better than endless open speculation which would only serve to confuse new readers. Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #79 ---
SQ, If you could take a look, please: Buy Level 1/2 ( between 2 green areas) got some space And 2 sell areas (pink spaces) looks like there is almost no space at all between 1/2 pink area, just a few pips.. Something is wrong with that picture? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
All right, market just opened 10 minutes ago (0:00 GMT+2), i had my MT4 up and running before that, and i saw my new daily OldDog zones and levels appear... the indicator rocks! Let's now get serious about testing this strategy! We have a full month before us! SQ

--- 帖子 #81 ---
well... formulas are formulas... i see your chart shows 86pips for the phase gap for october. Strange. Myself and OldDog did come to 100pips. Don't know where this would come from. sq

--- 帖子 #82 ---
99 pips for Oct here...and my screen shot.. I have a few bars on Friday after the NY close...and it's messing with my Sunday open display. This is a live FXPro account. So I wonder if the indicator could ignore any data after the Friday NY close. Cheers CanuckCT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Could you explain again how to calculate the baseline??

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hmm, strange I'm trying on other Broker (IBFX) same picture, using last version INDY posted.. Changed background color, to see more details, otherwise, cannot see Phase 0 which is black line: Now looking better but 87 pips still Let's see if anyone else come up with that number

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Squalou, On an earlier post (this one actually -&gt; http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&amp;postcount=30 ), I had suggested that we might develop an indicator that draws a fib for NY close breakouts. The pic of this indicator might look like this (just the fibs, not the breakout boxes): Attached Image It makes sense that either an ATR or Average Daily Range type calculation come into play in determining the height of the fib. For example, if EURUSD had an ATR or ADR of say 150, then we might draw a fib range for 75 pips up and 75 pips down and fib lines would only extend for the current day. I'm attaching a couple of these type of indicators that display the ranges, regardless of timeframe. Since the pairs often try to fill most of their daily range, this type of . The indicator might also have an override....so if you wanted to set it to 75 pips regardless of the calculation, you could do so. Seems to me the fib would be drawn on the first tick of the new day....so you can capture the most recent day. We'll collectively need to give this some thought regarding whether it makes sense to pursue it, but the visual of the fib on a few hundred days is something that cannot be easily drawn without an indicator. I'm suggesting this because we might stumble upon something to help with a way of setting daily breakout targets that might help Old Dog or develop a variation on his calculations. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Just so we don't get into a lot of discussion about different broker times and differing phase pip value, everyone should download an FXPro demo. Then we won't have 100 posts discuss the different pip phases. I'll be deleting those posts to tidy things. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #87 ---
The reason the phase gap is different is because the indicator uses ATR to calculate it. If you have a broker that has a few hours of data on Sunday night, that counts as a day as far as ATR is concerned and that "smaller" day will give you a smaller phase calculation. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I'm posting this on behalf of theGuru... I had intended to post it on the Abonacci thread only to find that I don't have posting privileges there. I guess this thread is seen by the creator of that thread to be a problem. So I post it here. If someone deems it appropriate, they could post it on the Abonacci thread, but do so at you own peril. Please do not ask me to support this by answering questions re what it does or how to use. Those questions will be ignored and persistence in asking them will be problematic. Cheers CanuckCT Here is the note from theGuru: "Because I am a man of my word and I said I would post the calculations should I work them out, here is an indicator that you should all find usefull (I hope). This indicator is based solely on my interpretation of Bobbi's calculations. Please note though ... Due to the way I was treated earlier (being called 'Gobshite','Popous fool','Wanker','MORON', etc), for some reason FF has deemed that I should be suspended and receive an infraction. I find this totally ridiculous and if this is how FF treats their members then I don't want to be part of it. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any support or updates for this indicator but it should continue to work unless Bobbi decides that the magic 127pip range is no longer 127pips (which it won't always be). Please also be aware that if the 127pip range is changed, those who have hung on to the original calculator will most likely find it failing."

One more thing, and this is important, DO NOT FILL THIS THREAD WITH A DISCUSSION OF THIS INDICATOR! Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Were you able to get it to run? I'm not using Vista on this pc but after downloading and trying to open it, I couldn't get it to run either.

@squalou Good job on the indie, it works great!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Guys You may recall what I said in my earlier posts about the trading precision that can be obtained by carefully picking the right S/R using these ideas. Attached the latest chart showing a stall accurate to less than 1 pip. These are my weekly lines (not monthly, like Aebab), calculated at market open at 0000 on a GMT+3 broker. This is why I don't bother too much with the Calculator. I just trade the lines. A 100+ pips trade like this each day is all you need. Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I made the following changes to the indicator: - set the default NY_Close to match FXPro Server (0:00/GMT+3), which has no sunday candles. - fixed the friday/sunday candles/zones bug; i tested with various "NY_close" time settings, on Alpari-UK(gmt+2) and FXPro(gmt+3) servers, all ok. - display Pivot and Sentiment lines values; - changed colors so they display decently on both a white and black background... I still get 99p for October Phase Range on FxPro also, which should not be affected by the sunday candles as there are none with this broker. You guys having different results should try to update your History (F2), and recalc all timeframes. Not yet added CanuckCT fibs, that will be for next version. SQ

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Many thanks for your insight, OD. Are you able to tell us what calculation(s) you are using for the levels in this chart, if they are not from your calculator?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hello Chow There is nothing magic going on here. If you put all the lines on your chart that have thus far been suggested, as Skyzer says, it is hard to see daylight between them. How in hell are you going to trade that mess? Not all lines are created equal! Just look back at the recent PA and you will soon see which lines "matter" and which are just a distraction. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s.../yim/happy.gif Good luck Old Dog

Hey Squalou, Very nice work. And a clean, crisp chart when white background used. Good job on those few small bugs. Pending approval from Old Dog, our work here could be done, once baseline calculation finalized. I also have a Guru indicator that is similar and will post it soon. The targets for today have been met. I got some of these pips...hope others did also. I'll check against the original Old Dog calculator and others should do the same. Now everyone who's paying attention, don't forget to use some smart money management if you are blindly taking these trades. Personally I'm using it to confirm other things I look for. Tis most pleasant. Cheers CanuckCT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello, I very much approve of the excellent work being done here, so ably coordinated by CanuckCT. This thread is a testament to what a few dedicated people can achieve by pooling resources and talent, while keeping the morons at bay... Some good pips today - well done to all! Best regards Old Dog Edit: Looks like our readership is increasing so we must be doing something right!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
After some discussion with Old Dog, I'm posting a spreadsheet that calculates "a" baseline. It's not perfect and may in fact not be as good as what you will get with your eyes and looking at price action. But it's an objectively determined number that others can assess, and perhaps improve. The trader who provided the spreadsheet calculation shall remain anonymous unless he indicates otherwise, then shall receive full kudos for his work. Here is what I suggest we do. Work out a way to add this to the indicator so that it auto-calculates. Think of a way to allow for future override of the base value. So some type of external table...or an indicator that is a table, makes sense. When you add the Baseline Override indicator to the chart, it needs three values..year, month, price....and have a provision for say 12 months to start. Drop down boxes would be best for those people who might type a number greater than 12 or a formatted value for the year that makes no sense. The Old Dog indicator will first look to the Baseline Override indicator to see if any baseline levels are overridden. If so, it uses that override value for the baseline for that month. For the months where no baseline override exists, it does the calculation in the spreadsheet. The indicator that Guru is working on uses a certain fib calculation to create a baseline and also uses this spreadsheet. The fib calculation is different than what this spreadsheet does, obviously, so we'll have two different approaches, so this is good. However, both calculations are objectively determined. Enjoy. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #101 ---
A special thanks to both Squalou and Guru who have both been working hard to translate these trading ideas into a tool to help to trade this approach. Well done guys! I expect that we'll get to a stage where our work here will be done, and the thread can be closed to further posts. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi squalou, When price breaks to the downside, a fib extension is a most obvious way to identify a potential target. (same for upside break). When/if you get to this aspect, can you allow for a customizeable fib extension as per the pic below. So the fib tio the upside and downside would have a fib extension as a target for a greater move down from the NY close, per the pic below. There are two logical anchors for this...the NY close and the Old Dog pivot. So a provision for both would allow for full and complete analysis. Sorry about my presumption that you will do this...I sometimes get carried away. Attached Image Cheers CanuckCT

Drawing fibs manually (with the default fib tool inside MT4) takes seconds, so it is not very important to have special indicators for that. What I have done is that I firstly drew a line at 1.3673 (the "October base line" agreed by majority of people here) and then a line at 100 pips from the base (as much as I understood, 100 is the agreed gap for October). And then drew fibs between the lines. So, my first trade today was taken at the short break of 38.2/61.8. It hit TP at 53 pips. And now I am in long break of 38.2/61.8. Let us see if this will be a winner, too. Entry is 7 pips under/above 38.2/61.8 (7 + spread for long trades), SL = 40.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi, Indrek, how do you draw fibs with sign - (minus) ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
You have to manually add the levels with their labels in the fib properties. fxtsun ___________________________________ "Chance favours the prepared mind" - Louis Pasteur

CanuckCT, Where would you initiate the trade? 38.2/61.8, 0/100 Also, would you account for the recent trend which is up by putting a buy at the 138.2 or 161.8? BD

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Old Dog Thanks for posting this chart. As i was going through all of your attachment i was about to bring this chart into this thread but before me you did it thanks.. the X / O level what my understanding is its the phase calculation you have given us .. using atr(44) which is two month right? but this phase value stays same for the month if i'm correct but you mentioned you do get levels for weekly would you mind telling us how u do it weekly basis? Do you get weekly levels from two previous week trading range ? Thanks Hoichoi

The X/O levels are previous support/resistance, not calcs - i posted the same question earlier.

It seems we are now being referred to as the "copycat" thread. For the record, the only reason this thread was started was to develop some tools in an orderly way and to create some distance from a thread that was annoyingly out of control and a moderator who abruptly left with no indication he would return. Since the moderator of that thread has now decided to return and has banned some of us from posting there, we have no choice but to continue our work here and there is now no point to linking the two initiatives now anyway. Our work could have been done on the other thread as that was where it got started...but it's much more peaceful here.

You not going to believe what I discover, don't want to disappoint you, but I was drawing Fib Extentions/Fibs all day long, and was able to figure out future movements based on previous events, but, when I just drop simple Fib_Pivots Indicator, which was in my indicator folder like 2 years already, I was amazed how close my calculations was to the levels which simply drawn by Old mighty Indicator.. People trying to complicate things, it's a nature of thinking: Like if it's more difficult, this should work much better.. Check this out.. Images from TOP to the bottom #1 Original Old_Dog 2 lines screenshot posted earlier #2 Simple Empty chart 15M TF chart with Fib Indicator on the chart only. Showing those lines are nothing magical but simply RESISTANCE #1 and SUPPORT #1 RED on the bottom #3 you can basically apply areas to buy or sell SELL below pivot to S1 then, SELL below S2 to S3 Area #2 and so on, same goes for BUY above pivot, above S1, and above S2 and so on... That's how easy it is.. YES, it's off just a bit plus minus few pips... But Abonachi dude, create sh*t load of software to point out something, which already exists many years ago like 1, 2, 3 Now, be my guest and take a look, sorry to simplify things.. Nothing magical here: P.S Sorry I just realize that those Fib lines are too dark, but you still can see them.. Will fix and post again

My words exactly in Post #95. Nothing magical here!! The Fib lines calculated from the baseline and phase gap are nothing more than good old-fashioned S/R. Couple that with some more good old-fashioned PA and you are home and dry. Glad to see my message finally getting through!! Regards Old Dog

So we've made some good progress in the past few days.... Just had a chat with Old Dog..here is what we propose for the thread. 1. There are a few things we want to explore with the indicator that Squalou has so graciously been working on, some tidbits on that are sprinkled throughout this thread. 2. When guru is ready, he'll release his indicator. 3. There is some discussion about EA....so perhaps we set up a sister thread for that discussion, with everything out in the open. Any volunteers to moderate that process? 4. We'd like to turn this thread into a "Post a chart - have a discussion" kind of thread of what is happening with EU and GU, like a trading plan of sorts, areas of interest to watch for and have discussions about upcoming trades and trades just completed. 5. Perhaps a skype trading room....a place to hang for those that need it. Those rooms can be a distraction from your trading, so I'm not sure about that. It often turns into a place to learn, rather than a place to trade. Other suggestions are welcome. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Is the pivot line at 1.3694 meant to be a buy point? I think I'm missing the point of the pivot line. Maybe I'm just supposed to look at the pivot point and the sentiment to see if the bias is to go long or short? Thanks for any help. Spencer

--- 帖子 #127 ---
This is my current 'Old Dog' chart. I've tweaked the code to remove most of the lines other than Old Dog's Pivot and Sentiment levels and added another pivot indy for comparison and i'm still interested in the main phase levels, so kept those too. Old Dog has already mentioned the key, ie supply/demand areas and price action around those zones, taking high probability/low risk trades between the two. Price is currently in an interesting area, at yesterday's supply zone...wonder how many of us are biased long at the moment. Ordinarily i'd be looking at the chart now thinking bull flag, longs all the way...now i'm not so sure Perhaps the demand zone down at the weekly pivot (3650ish) is where the stronger bulls are waiting and the better trading opp into the longer term trend exists...

Those currency moves are crazy it's a currency war going on out there. Most trying to avoid their currency to go any higher against USD. Especially Asia. All I can say it's hard to trade during NY session, EUR was on the ropes yesterday night, woke up today and watching it near 1.38 again and nothing or almost nothing left to trade.. Need Robot, which going to take care of those moves overnight. Making some pips (LONG) on AUDUSD and NZDUSD (broke out).

...all the way back to March supply now.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I've applied a fib to the NY close, using 1/2 of the 44 day range as the swing. The 161.8 extension would suggest we've met out daily range to the upside. M15 now has inside bar....so that price action has me wary of upside move. A move below 1.3790 and I'll be looking to sell. We did print a new high for the week....for what that's worth. Here is my chart. Cheers CanuckCT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

G'day folks! I'm another refugee from the other thread. Far too confusing over there, Yellow fib, blue fib white fib, breakout template, 74 fib, calculators (huh?) ... and it seems to have gotten a tad religious .... "Follow the gourd!".... "No! Follow the sandal!" ... and watch what you say or you'll be invited to the stoning... as the main attraction! (for all you Life of Brian fans). This looks a bit more on the sane side! Thanks to CanuckCT for letting me in! Anyway, I've attached a couple of tools to help with money management as I saw someone mentioning that subject earlier. I've zipped it all in the correct folders, so if you unzip into your main metatrader folder, they should land in the right spots. In the zip are: Pointprice indicator , which simply gives you value per pip (and point if 5 digit) as account currency and % of balance, as well as the current spread. Trade scripts for easy trade opening, with inbuilt money management. You can set the % risk when you first start the script (default is 2%). This is calculated from the stop size and the cost per pip, and the lot size is adjusted accordingly, to meet the required risk. Both draw lines which you drag to where you want them and it places the trades when you hit the "OK" button. Open_position opens a trade at market after you set your stop loss (red line. (Buy/sell is automatic ... if stop is above price, it is a sell, if stop is below price, it is a buy). Pending_position sets a pending order after you set the three lines (red=stop_loss, green=entry, blue=target). Hope you find them useful! Regards, Bigtent. PS. The scripts will not work without the money_management.mqh file in the include directory so make sure you put that there!

Hi All First thanks to everybody here trying to make a easy understanding system. But can I ask some few Quistion about it, or is it too early. I dont want to get banned from here So let me ask first then ask thanks Fratelli

--- 帖子 #153 ---
First of all thanks to you and Squalou and of course Old dog. Its nice to see you have control of the thread, I was a follower of the other one but it seems to have turned to chaos and lost direction. i would reiterate what glyntt said earlier if possible it could be quite beneficial to have some basics behind the whole idea and where we should be looking to trade e.g today like you mentioned out of the breakout trades we had 1 loser and 2 successful. I dont want to sidetrack the thread in anyway but hopefully when we are all on the same page and fully understand what we're looking for the price to do next we can all move forward together and thread will move from a development stage. Once again thanks guys, I look forward to the coming weeks. Regards Rump.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
This may be dumb question. When it says BO does it mean buy to open. If so the arrow pointing down also shows BO. Do we put Buy stop at the price indicated on the indicator

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I have not had to ban anyone yet - the rules here, as per the first post are: Any introduction of other indicators that do not relate directly to the purest form of this trading approach will get you banned from posting on this thread. Any disrespectful commentary will get you banned from this thread. Generally being an ass and not making a positive contribution to the thread will get you banned. There was one post that seems a little off topic, and it was removed by the poster....we just want to be civil is all! Ask away! Cheers CanuckCT

BO1 = Break Out1, BO2 = Break Out 2

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Thanks. Dumb me should have known. But if I had taken break out short at 3649 I would have lost. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi All Here some quistion I have 1. In old ABO thread there was a rule about entry at BO level + 7pips Do we do the same here.? 2. Do we always trade direction on the sentiment. If so yesterday we miss 2 great trades, but today we saved from a loosing one. 3. Where do we place SL 4. Do we only take trades in the green and red boxes, or is it ok to take trades if price close above a blue pivot line.? 5. Do we also use old rule about if price go above 38.2 fib it will go to next phase line.? Hope some off this make sence. thanks fratelli ps. maybee I find more Quistins later, if so pardon me

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Yes, but some common sence made you not to take this trade. 1. Up trend 2. Sentiment above pivot 3. Asia session I have yet to see fail any signal from this indie if i trade in the direction of the 4h trend.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Above Pivot. Check it out again Pivot 3694 Breakout to sell 3656

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Here is what I think you can follow as a set of rules.... Each day there are two lines on your chart....a pivot and a sentiment. These number are based on calculations provided by Old Dog. When the Sentiment is higher than the pivot, the bias is up and when the Sentiment is lower than the pivot, the bias is down. As far as taking trades, you first must determine if you want to consider the bias. Yesterday there were two winning sell trades. If you let bias influence you decision, you would have passed on these trades and had no trades. Today, bias is still up....so you would have taken both buy trades and ignored the sell trade, if you are letting sentiment affect your decision. I am suggesting you trade with the bias...but there will be lots of trades in the other direction that you pass on when doing this. Think of the template as a tool. Sometimes your decisions will result in a losing trade...that's trading. Pick an approach and follow it. That is why we are developing the EA, so we might do a thorough backtesting of a couple of these strategies. A visual inspection of the trades indicates, to me, that trading with the sentiment is a winning strategy. Consider this strategy #1 and there are two ways to play it. There are other strategies that will develop as we move along. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #162 ---
As long as it is absolutely unclear how the base line and phase gap are being calculated, I decided to use a bit different approach. My phase gap is the average range of last 20 days and the last day pivot always marks 50 % of the phase. Today, ADR(20) was 144 pips, so my phase was 72 pips above and below the daily pivot. Traded the break of 38.2% and banked 80 pips on EU and 75 pips on EY. Sorry to be a bit off topic. Just wanted to show that the main idea can be used in different ways. Every trader has to find his/her own way instead of blindly following anyone else's approach. By the way: I have had some doubts about using 99-100 pips as a phase gap for October instead of 127 one month earlier. The problem is that October is usually a very good month for trading. With good trends and volatility. So, I find it not too logical to reduce the phase gap for October. It should be vice versa. So, I stick to ADR(20) that I understand better.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
1. no 2. see my previous post 3. I would suggest 40 pips....but this is just my view. Sometimes the risk/reward is not great. 4. You can use pivot to trade if you like and develop a strategy around that. If you come up with something, you might report back. 5. No, there is no such rule here. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Im not sure what you meant, but CanuckCT explained what i meant with considering sentiment. Personaly i use this indie instead of pivots in combination with my trading system, so i dont take every trade, just the ones that agree on both sides.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Good stuff...the notion that each pair will fill it's average daily range is a valid one. Using 38.2 up and down to get you in, I like that. Easy every day to set it up and trade it. And easy to apply to many pairs. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I would not be sure about many pairs. They may behave too differently. I trade only EU and EY, so I know that these two respect pivots and fibs equally very well. At the same time, GU has had not much logics during last months or even longer period.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Ok thanks, nevermind, I found few

--- 帖子 #168 ---
This is what I use for pivots. I draw the phase border lines and fibs "by hand".

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thank you very much for explaining in detail. Appreciate very much.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
i had locked the indi to only EU and GU as these where the only ones for which we initially had figures. But now that we have formulas, we can apply them to any instrument, of course. At least for the Phase levels and Ranges. However, i don't think we can apply OldDog's BO/Targets formulas, as these where specifically "optimized" for EU. i'll "unlock" the indi and post a new version. SQ

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Agree....we may be able to optimize for other pairs. I'd like to try EJ. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Maybe it's a good Idea to optimize it for EURUSD only for now and when it's near perfect, think about other pairs as extra. Heck, If you can surely sweep pips from single pair, I don't think you need anything else. IMHO.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
The internet is a wonderful resource....how did we ever get along without it. Attached is an article from Fibonacci Trader...it's old, but relevant. It talks about creating fib zones to trade in and around. I'm attaching two indicators...one is an exe file but the other is not and it does the same calculations. My request is the creation of an indicator that will draw these zones by selecting either daily, weekly or monthly data. Me thinks this is a way to create a baseline using fibs. The pic below shows the the levels based on prior day. If we use monthly data, it will be based on prior month...and I bet one of those lines can be our base value. Attached Image What's old is new again. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Now that I am able to post again (thanks Twee for taking the time to listen to my side of situation and agree that I did indeed have a case against the suspension and infraction), here is my version of an indicator that I have been working on during the course of these threads. Please note that my indicators, especially in situations like this where there are several possible routes, may look complicated but this is only because I try to provide for all possabilities which means needing lots of options. For those who simply want to see 'suggested' trades based on OldDogs calculator and the BaseLine calculation provided in the spreadsheet earlier, just place the indicator on your chart with the defaults. (NB: Remember this is designed for FXPro but should work similarly on any GMT+3 broker, but your figures may be different. There is nothing we can do to get around this.) Now for those who want to things a little differently, take a look at the options and apply a little comon sense to what they should be set to. Eg: There is a different way to calculate the baseline using various Fib lines (which I personally believe is more likely to be the 'Bobbi way'). To use this method set FibBaseline=TRUE. If you want to specify a Phase Range instead of calculating it, set PhaseOverride=# of pips (such as 127 if you think the range should still be 127 this month) If you want to use (what I believe is) Bobbi's calculator results instead of OldDogs, set ODCalcs=FALSE. NB: Although I believe my version of Bobbi's calc are close, there are situations where they will not match to within 1 pip. Other options include the ability to turn various bits on (TRUE) and off (FALSE) and all are logically named ... ShowPhases - the various phase lines ShowDailyLines - the results of the calculated levels either OD's or Bobbi's ShowComment - a big nasty comment with all the claculations ShowCalcTrades - 'suggested' trades, color coded based on sentiment. 'Good' means 'with the sentiment', 'Bad' means against it. Finally, the last 3 usefull options are ... BreakRate - number of pips past a particular line before a trade box is drawn (ie how meny pips must a line be broken by before the trade goes in) MinimumTP - if a trade results in less than this # of pips profit, the 2nd target line will be used as TP instead of the 1st SLRate - to show a trade box indicating StopLoss. NB: when these boxes overlap, things can start looking ugly

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Good work guru...as usual. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #176 ---
OldDog .. I have a question about your calculations... We know that the formulae is (a*x)+(b*y) where x and y are close and MV respectively and a and b are contants. Now, given that the range is variable, shouldn't the constants differ relative to the range? eg if close if 25pips away from MV, then you will be given a trade worth z pips. But z will be the same regardless of whether the range is 50pips or 150pips. Surely if the range is going to be greater, then the expected trade target should also be bigger?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Just another take. Magenta lines = Weekly Fib Blue and Red Fibs = Based on previous day's ATR(22)=144/2=72 pips up and 72 pips down from NY close Will post resulting PA tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I have similar fibs on mine also. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Guru, Thank you for this great indicator. Does it need any routine (Monthly, daily,..etc.) updates or inputs of Baselines, Phase ranges,..etc. or does thie keep updating itself continuously? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #180 ---
No updates required. Will update every day and every month forever. Whether the calculations continue to be relavent day after day and month after month ... that's a different story

--- 帖子 #181 ---
CCT: Now comes the fun part, figuring out how to trade. Potentially using Fib Zones or: "Good stuff...the notion that each pair will fill it's average daily range is a valid one. Using 38.2 up and down to get you in, I like that. Easy every day to set it up and trade it. And easy to apply to many pairs." Your Post #165 How about 1st Stand Deviation of Daily ATR(22) vs Daily ATR(22)? Why? Average means some greater and some less than. Therefore a pair will not always fill it's average daily range. An example would be a Daily Inside Bar. What do you think? BD

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I think the way to look at ATR is how many days back do you want to consider. The fewer the days, the more responsive to recent volatility, the more days, the more smoothing you achieve. 22 days is good for me for now....and I will be applying to Old Dog Pivot. Will pay attention to price action around these levels. Cheers CanuckCT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi Guru What you say is true, of course. For larger ranges, we could stretch out the targets. Indeed, every once in a while the constants are updated based on recent market behaviour, although the numbers we have at present were done in 2005! But the calc was designed to be quite conservative. Yes, it will leave pips on the table, but not very many! My philosophy is that I would rather bag my 45 pips, say, with some high degree of probability, than shoot for 55 pips and have the market turn before my TP is hit. We can, of course, change the numbers to be more aggressive, if you want. Thanks for all the work on the indy! Regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I wasn't really thinking about more or less aggressive ... just more relevant to current conditions Any chance you could let me know how you determine those constants so we can look at improving the indicator even further?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I continue with my setup using daily ATR(20) for phase range. See how price has been struggling with a phase border at 1.3848. No decision made where to go - up or down.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
The calc is just a simple least-squares linear regression over the recent past using matrix differential linear algebra, see attached pic. Worked example Say we believe that we can predict the following day's Close from todays Hi, Lo and Close. We want to find three constants x, y, z , so that: Close(tomorrow) = x * Hi(today) + y * Lo(today) + z * Close(today) This is very easy. Matrix A shows the Hi, Lo and Close for the EU for 28 days ending day before yesterday. Matrix B shows the Closes up to yesterday (shifted so you can see the alignment). The differential equation reduces to the formula given (good exercise to prove this yourself!). Then x = 0.4437, y = 0.0476 and z = 0.5104. Note that this data from September is an UP month! Hence, the coefficient y , of the previous Low, is very small. Today's Close is mainly affected by yesterday's Hi and yesterday's Close. So all you need to do in our calc is bung in a list of previous Close and Mid-Fib, together with a set of targets where the price actually went, and you can easily find a set of constants that will hit those targets in an optimum way most of the time. Again, no magic here. Just secondary school maths... Regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hey Guys, This looks interesting and might fly! Attached is the current Oil (WTISB) chart. I have always wanted to be able to trade Oil as it is always volatile even when other things are dead. But every time I have tried in the past I have got absolutely hammered!! The lines are optimised over the year to Sept 30. The big font is Monthly targets, calculated at the start of each month and valid for the month. The smaller font is weekly targets, calculated at the start of each week and valid for the week. You can also do this daily, of course, if you want! Note that the Monthly "O" coincides with the Weekly "X". This represents a strong barrier . Price rose off these baselines and turned at Weekly "O". After a textbook 50% retrace it went up to hit Monthly "A" accurate to better than half a pip!! Woof! Woof! Again, it retraced 50% almost to the number, went up to hammer through Monthly "A" with some momentum, then came back to rest at that level. I'll be keeping an eye on this... Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #188 ---
When I get a chance, I'll do an update Using Squalou Indicator for EU Only Old Dog Targets (Starting Oct 1, 2010) and 40 pip stop Trading with Sentiment Today 1/1 +32 pips This Month 5/5 +171 pips Trading without regard to Sentiment Today 1/1 +32 pips This Month 7/8 +198 pips Guru Indicator for EU Fib Calculation for Baseline, 127 pip phase This approximates Abonacci Phases and Calculator Trading With Sentiment Today 0/1, -40 This month 3/4, +100 pips Trading without regard for Sentiment Today 0/2, -80 This month 4/7, +104 pips Cheers CanuckCT Edit...Page one seems like a good spot for this.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I very much like this approach. No need to get greedy with this. An alternative more aggressive strategy is worth pursuing, but the strategy as is, using those 2005 variables that have not been optimized for recent data, seem to be working. No need to mess with it, just trade it. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Even trades against sentiment have great hit rate...interesting.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
very impressive indeed. thanks for the detail...but when you said without regard to sentiment, does it mean trades are set up in both direction?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Do as you please....trade both ways or only in direction of sentiment. Your choice. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I still have my doubts about the stage this month. Seems to me that 100 is fair.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
The 100 is derived from a calculation...the 127 is arbitrary. Everyone can decide for themselves what approach suits their style of trading. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #196 ---
If there is anyone who has any EA programming skills, can you send me a PM. I have reached out to a few people...and everyone is so busy. Thanks. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Well, the approach has worked pretty well for a quarter of a century, through boom and bust, give or take. Even if you do the optimisation I described earlier today, the constants won't change that much. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Putting together an EA for this would be very simple as my understanding is that we are just doing trades at the indicated breakout levels with a TP of target 1 or 2 and a fixed SL (as per the trade boxes shown on my indicator) This can be achieved by creating pending orders at the start of each day, BUT ... I think there is more tweeking required first with respect to entry/exit points. Some buy trades are showing up below the opening price which to me means something is not quite right. Also, I believe that the trades should be more dynamic (as discussed with OD earlier) We should also decide if trades should be taken multiple times. By this I mean the following scenario ... The first buy breakout is triggered and wins. The price then drops back to below the entry point of the buy. Do we take a 2nd buy on the way down? Do we wait for a close below the entry point to create a new pending order? Do we wait for it to cross the pivot instead? All of these strategies have merits and can actually work very well.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I must have been away that day So I will be the first to admit that I have no idea how to translate this into a calculation which will provide the various constants in our existing trade calculations. But thinking about this logically, wouldn't entry and exit points just be aligned somehow with the phases relative to close (or even just the phases themselves. I understand the whole COD concept but if the phases don't change for a month, why should we be limited to a daily closing value? Just throwing it out there for discussion)

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I "probably" was there... but "surely" forgot about it since then OldDog, you are fantastic! Are you using Matlab to get those resolved ? What we want here is this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares And the commonly used algorithm to solve that is the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenbe...ardt_algorithm for which a reference C implementation can be found here: http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/ An excellent math page about multiple linear regression theory, but it's in french (couldn't find the equivalent in english) http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9...9aire_multiple Another good resource for C coders (easily adapted to C#), which has algos for multiple linear regression too (and many more): http://www.nrbook.com/c/ Now we have our challenges: -1- code the least-squares multiple linear regression into mq4... -2- find what values we are going to feed it with !!! SQ

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hard work ahead.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
My dear Squalou I recognise you clearly as a fellow Jedi as the Force is very strong with you! You have understood the optimisation required completely and I do indeed use Matlab. Solving the required set of equations is just one command in Matlab, but I fear will be rather harder in MQ4. Although matrix inversion is the obvious route, it is extremely painful to code. I suggest a Ridders-type forwards-and-backwards minimisation approach which, while less efficient, is not so much code. But I leave the serious coding decisions to your good self. Very best regards Old Dog

I like that kind of challenge... it is less boring than coding the same EA variations ever and ever again .... What we can do while i (and others if you feel like it...) try to figure out how to code the multiple linear regression thingie, is to determine the data that we are going to feed the algo with... OldDog, you are the best person here who knows what data where fed to obtain your Pivot, Sentiment, BO and Target levels, right ?... If i may... SQ.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Squalou and Guru, I am not sure if this can be done, but is it possible to have something in the indicator that determines how MANY phases will be drawn? I want to try and look to targets which are sometimes well away from the current price. I also want to draw some other fibs that will start higher. However at the moment, both indicators are only as high as the current phase and not beyond that. It's no problem if this can not be done, as I will draw them in manually, but it woudl really be handy. Even if the default is to draw 2/3 phases above the current one. Is it possible? Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Guys For all of you who have PM'd and emailed me, please remember that while we are up to our arses in alligators (programming linear algebra optimisations etc), the original objective was to drain the swamp (make a few pips!). The basic idea here is very simple: (1) Use some magic computations (many ways to do this, eg Bobi, OD, fudomyo, etc) to draw a VERY FEW magic lines where the market has a VERY STRONG CHANCE of reacting. I would suggest an absolute maximum of 6 lines on the entire chart , say 3 above and 3 below the current price. As Skyzer says, we do not want a chart like a zebra with lines every 10 pips! It is untradable. (2) Interpret simple Price Action near those lines to make trading decisions. That's it. As CanuckCT will testify, as he and I were chatting live yesterday, I had a line 1.3779 where I went long. My next line was at 1.3939 for my TP. I was basically calling the top at 3939. In fact the market top yesterday was 1.3945. I made 160 pips but I was robbed of 6 pips http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/big_grin.gif . Did you notice how the market kept bouncing off 3939 all evening? The 0800 (GMT+3) bar was a perfect hammer off 3939. Then at 0900 came the volatility breakout, and so we go to the next line... Properly interpreted PA on its own will win you 6 or 7 out of 10 trades. Properly interpreted PA near significant levels will win you 14/15 trades. Couple that with R:R of 1:4+ and you don't even need to do the sums to see what you can achieve. Keep it simple, guys!! Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Thanks Old dog for your clear example, but is these numbers from your same calculation you provided earlier Hello guru/sql Please can you explain, old dog was saying in the forum just now as he had a line in 1.3779 and next line was 1.3939 and he made 160 pips, how come neither guru or sq indicator have these lines? The whole point of using these indicators using old dogs calculation is for these special numbers?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Old Dog, Very impressive! Im sure im not the only person who your ideas have had a very positive effect on and leading me to explore more into how key prices are giving us a good road map for the days trading. May I ask how close are your lines to the ones that have been created on Squalous's indi? Appreciate what your doing here guys. Regards Rump.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Guys, These lines are NOT in the current indicators, so please don't hassle Squalou or Guru for them. This is a brand new idea that is still in development. For me, it represents the logical ultimate extension of the levels/PA ideas I have used for years. I have just closed off my trades for the day and am off out. While trading, I was in live chat with CanuckCT and LeeMonk. I am doing this because I believe it is very important for the credibility of this thread that these kind of claims can be independently verified by respected traders. I called the TP at 1.40275 , see chart. The high for the day (thus far) is 1.40280, so we were accurate to 0.5 pip. Robbed again! http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/big_grin.gif This has now worked for 2 days in a row. But two days is not proof of concept. Just cause for optimism. Please don't ask for details yet. Chart attached. Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #217 ---
A few people have sent me e-mails or PMs regarding what to do, so I'll post my take on what is here on this thread. Squalou's Indicator This indicator was the initial indicator using the Old Dog breakout strategy that uses the NY close and Old Dogs pivot calculations and related breakout trades. That was the setup that caught my eye as one that seemed to be profitable. This is the one I use at the moment for my trades. Guru's Indicator Guru's indicator is a bit more complex. It calculates a baseline using fibs or a calculation that is provided earlier on this thread. It then does breakout calculations based on Old Dog calculations or his interpretation of the Abonacci calculator and by default he uses a 7 pip buffer for the breakout zone. So, that's four choices with Guru's indicator....(yes, I am watching all four out of curiosity) Fib Baseline, Old Dog breakouts Calculated Baseline, Old Dog Targets Calculated Baseline, Calculated Targets Fib Baseline, Calculated Targets So with these tools, there is likely a breakout strategy somewhere that might work for you. Whether it stands the test of time will be for you to judge. Old Dog has indicated his calculations were optimized in 2005. take that for what it's worth. You will not have a 100% wins. You will have losses. But you also need a number of trades to evaluate. So I have summarized the results since October 1...a very small timeframe, for the different settings. You can't trade them all...well I guess you could with good money management. The point is, there is enough here to give you an edge, I believe, if you are having trouble with price action. My two cents. Rough calculations since October 1, 2010 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm not going to build you any templates...that you'll need to do on your own. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Two days....and a top was called with me. So, is a work in progress...please don't keep pushing for how...just enjoy the tools already here. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I can varify that OD's targets were given to me well in advance of price action and he was even kind enough to send me some pics...... of the charts. In relation to keeping the credability in the thread............ I think there may have been to many "Hell yeahs", "woop woops" and a few swear words in the chat to do that On a serious note. This advanced system looks incredibly good......... even on OIL! Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Adler, OD and I have been chatting about these SR lines. The point of the post was to demonstrate that if you look for the correct PA around these lines, then the trades should present themselves well. Clearly OD has some very good levels, but he won't trade them without PA....... ask him. You should get decent PA off the current set of lines too and if you see price acting around a certain level at differnt times of the day, then it may be worth looking at why.... throwing some fibs on etc etc...... if its a key area that regularly works, then you can take advantage of it. Regards Lee

Guys Here is an update of the previous chart. Look how precisely the market respects these lines. They are accurate to the pip. And remember, we drew these lines on the chart last Friday night! Regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Amazing work guys. @CanuckCT Im not a coder, but if you need help with any "grinding" work let me (us) know..

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I have Abonacci templates and Indy on my screen in some of them I forgot to change PIP Range, on some have different BaseLine, And they all "work" there is always a line, when price stops and you can scream: "Wow it's working". I think it's total BS. OD, can you tell me how you draw those line, you said last Friday? Simply scroll left and Identify those support resistance area based on Historic events? That's how I'm doing recently.

Good work, looks like you may be onto something special!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Personal opinion, I believe that both the identification of pivo and phase values are most important to this method, from there follow the established rules. But it still did not understand the OD, the lines he draws are different from those provided by standard fibo

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I think what OD is trying to explain is that the needed lines can be drawn by any trader without any special tools, indicators, fibs etc. You just have to draw the lines at the levels where price has found support and/or resistance. The only tools that you need are: 1) your eyes; 2) your understanding of the market. It has, of course, nothing to do with the initial system. But it is far more promising than messy charts full of yellow, blue and white lines.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Guys, Hats off to Skyzer! He has as good as cracked my system. Yes, I compute some Fib lines etc. But then I look back into the past to see which lines coincide with interesting PA on the H4, Daily and Weekly charts. Then I throw all the others away. Truth to tell, I hardly need the computations now. I have been doing this for so long, I can just look at the W1/D1/H4 charts and draw the lines on by hand... http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s.../yim/happy.gif Sorry there isn't a "magic quantum physics formula" we can code in an indy! Regards Old Dog Edit: (1) Indrek posted the same moment. He understands! (2) But you do need a bit of experience for this. While you are getting it, trade the Squalou/Guru indicators. They are very good as CanuckCT has tabulated.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hello OD Thanks for your support, I appreciate your experience to confirm there is no magic formula as you said, But can you tell me what fibs you draw as a preparation for next day to draw these lines and what did you look up and found for resistence and support can you provide a chart with an example so that learners like us can just follow your method. We dont need any formula but a simple, single consistent method to follow which creates less losses and more profits. Can you kindly explain how you created this line 1.3779 and next line as TP 1.3939 to make 160 pips yesterday if it is just using a simple resistence/support and fibs? Thanks Adler

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Squalou, Here is an indicator that I wrote based of of the matrix math provided in the i-reg indicator found in MQ4 CodeBase. Take a look at the code and it may be of use in the matrix math regression calculations that have been mentioned earlier. The chart shows a cubic regression curve with 2 StdDevs shown. Regards, KingHigh

--- 帖子 #235 ---
here's a version (1.3) that will draw the Phases on any pair. You can still display the BO/TP zones, but remember that they were targetted to EU specifically, so don't expect anything from using them on other pairs... until we get the least square multiple ilnear regression matrix thingie sorted out You can also display the original Aebab phases on EU and GU by setting AutoCalcPhases to false; ukcool, here you go for GJ... EDIT: go to my next post below to get the 1.4... SQ

--- 帖子 #236 ---
guys i think old dog and canu are working on the new concept which i belive really promising .. i belive soon enouf they will share with us.. OD i like the approach of having 7 lines in chart weekly basis and have nothing on the chart..

--- 帖子 #237 ---
This one will display additional Phase levels below lowest/above highest price, so you can use those for future forcasting. that one is for Leemonk SQ

Thank you for confirmation, master Cheers, Sky.

thanks for that highking. will have a look... I found a Kalman Filter implementation in mql4 codebase: http://forum.mql4.com/6496 it has all kinds of matrix transform functions in it... nice! Kalman filters are also known for their predictive capabilities. SQ

Nice work OD. I'm always interested in other people's thinking because we all have such a different take on things (especially people who put in the necessary screen time and thought to find tangible, relevant solutions). Good luck with your experiment. I'm curious to see where it takes you. btw: I finished my new level indicator a couple of days ago if you'd like to check it out. Indi: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...07#post4079707 Template: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...72#post4082272 cheers

Kudos to your new level indy... Great work... Spot on... And thanks a lot.... Cheers !

Many thanks for sharing your work! Which MT broker do you run this with?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Fudomyo-san Thank you for calling into our thread and for your kind words. I am sure we will benefit enormously from your great experience. We have been honoured that several very senior traders such as smjones and yourself have found some interest here. Guys, Fudo has saved the coders a big job! Please load his indicators and template. I have checked and some of his lines coincide almost exactly with my calculations. Where I called the top with great accuracy the last two days, you will see his lines WR4 and MR4 coincide very closely. If you want a chart the same as mine, all you need to do is load his excellent indictor, then scroll back on the H4, daily and weekly and identify which lines coincide with significant PA. Then you can throw the rest of the lines away, and you will be left with a minimal set of lines that will earn you the same pips as I am getting. Many thanks and best regards, Old Dog

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thanks for the confirmation, OD. Greatest respect due to you both and others facilitating discussion/ideas on the thread. Many thanks to you all.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Thank you, is this for EURUSD mainly? Or can be used on Cable?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
1) GRFKalmanFilter.mq4 - put this in the indicators directory 2) GRFMatrixMath.mq4 - put this in the libraries directory 3) GRFMatrixMath.mqh - put this in the include directory Enjoy P.S I don't know, I just place it on the chart and it's looks like simple "Bollinger Bands" with added levels nothing special.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
thanks SkyzerFX. These are about the same as the ones i had pointed, just a different code layout. Now we have the tools... in separate parts. We need to assemble them. And we need to get the bolts!!! SQ

--- 帖子 #250 ---
lol.... lots of 'em by the sounds of it. I cant help with the calculations, but I'll happily hold the box of bolts whilst you try

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hmm, strange I download them from the site on MTL4 forum http://www.gammarat.com/Forex/BlackBoxes/Kalman/ that directory doesn't open, looks like Index page is missing, but if you add file name at the end of that URL, you still can download those files.. Great Idea SQ, waiting for your new Indicator, Thank you for your hard work..

Guys Just so we remember why we're all here in the first place, it's Friday night, the beer is cold and it's time to take stock. Attached my last couple of months from the MT terminal. As you can see, around 65 trades and +60%. I know the "Big Swinging Dicks" say you should be making 3% a day but I can't stand the risk myself. 1% a day is enough for me. On my £10K account that's £100 a day. Keeps me in beer vouchers.... http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/winking.gif (And I HATE big drawdowns....) Have a great weekend Old Dog Edit: By the way, bad news. I've drunk all the beer....

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Can we implement EA based on that strategy? I see it's been very popular lately to trade those "Lines" About 3-4 threads based on that.. I've been trying manually using live account, no success what so ever.. I mean looks like its possible to place line anywhere on the middle of the chart and say: Sell below and buy above.. I have gazzilion templates and Indicators still cannot prove this theory to be working.. The best what's working good so far, simple Trend lines on higher TF like H4+, but then you need 100+ pips stop loss at least.. I don't know, will experiment more.. And Demo account always grow up fast, I would be a billionaire by now, if I can trade Live same as on Demo.. Have a good weekend everyone.. P.S Going to go back to H4..

--- 帖子 #257 ---
OD, Love the avatar. Could you provide 4-5 steps on how you use your lines, determine entry, determine exit and determine tp? Please and thank you. It would help all and Skyzer BD

Those Aboonacci calculator team already eliminate all the people, who rise any skeptical questions, by simply blocking them out Like there is some "Magical" calculator which can predict the future, stolen from some outer space aliens Here is the other thread template, but based on the same thing.... Look areas with red circles, do you see any respect for support or resistance? This damn thing just flying allover the place like a fly... P.S: I know this is not exactly the same template, but I can load any of them and show exactly the same thing.. I don't think it's predictable in any way. Especially when you trying to rip off benefits short term a.k.a scalping or day trading.. Theoretically more frequently you trade, more you going to lose, same as on roulette.. The only way to win here is to have huge amount of money and buy and sell at the same time, closing only trades in profit... Timing Forex it's like trying to shoot the fly in the room with Magnum 47 while been drunk, it can be done I guess Nothing is impossible. P.S If there is real strategy behind this, then it can be coded and back tested, otherwise this is a bluff

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Skyzer, Agreed and why we are asking if OD came post some steps to his strategy. OD, hope you can take a few minutes of your time and help us out, again. Thanks in advance. BD

--- 帖子 #260 ---
The other thread is a typical scam setup as already pointed out. Hope, it will be binned soon.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
BD, maybe I was little overexcited yesterday, after whole week watching the screen, sorry. I was thinking and sleeping at the same time What I think is this. Those lines are IMPORTANT to Identify your profit taking or SL areas, which is already big deal. But trades must be taking on some other events, rather than simple line crossing. Or At least need to add something and have both events happened like ADX crossing (just an example) + line crossing.. Lets think together on this. I'm sure there is something.. 2 Problems I Identify when trading 1) Most of the times there is only 1-2 good setups withing 24 hours, all others are just a noise and more likely will lead to loss 2) When you take your trade you never know if this is 10 pip trade or 100 pip move, no way to Identify that. How many times it goes up 10 pips then down 20 pips, and then up 100 pips. So? Need decent Stop Loss And Trailing capabilities (before entering trade) as well some kind of EA. I have one, BUT, that EA doesn't have Magic Number as most of them. Working very good though I add 5-digit capability, so you don't have to worry about extra zeros with 5 digit brokers Here it is.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Thx Skyzer. This is very simplified version of SteveHopwood's fabulous "MPTM" EA. But it works great for what you need it for. Just a note: the TrailingStop and TrailingStep inputs are still expressed in "Point" units, not in true pips. I have fixed that -- attached. I also added a "slippage" input (was set to "5", which is 0.5 pips on 5D brokr). Just so that everyone here can use it for what it's worth. Will trail any open orders on the pair where you drop it. Nothing fancy, that's all we need... SQ

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I'm here at Future Shop Electronics Store...checking out the new 27 inch iMAC, really cool. So, I'll chime in on this....I sure hope there is no one that loses any cash....but with all the new traders going "oh wow"...regretably that looks like where it's heading. Cheers CanuckCT

There is a very old story about an American who visited the ancient English university town of Oxford. He was particluarly taken with the fabulous lawns in the quads of the colleges - they are as perfect as snooker tables. The American said, "Geez, I godda get me one of these back home!". So he asked the old groundsman how he could get a perfect lawn for himself. The old man said, "Well, sir, it's very easy. You just find a nice piece of flat ground. You rake it to get all the stones out and then you plant the grass seed and wait for it to grow. Then you roll it and mow it, roll and mow, roll and mow for a thousand years...". The moral of this story, guys, is that nothing worth having can be gained quickly. This is certainly true in Forex. I think some confusion may have arisen (which is my fault) as this thread contains two trading methods: METHOD A is suitable for beginners. It is a simple, mechanical breakout system based on my old calculator and a set of lines at significant price points. All the hard work has been done for you in the excellent indicators kindly provided by Squalou and Guru. CanuckCT has refined this system and described it very clearly on the thread and shown that it can be quite profitable if traded sensibly. METHOD B is my own system that, perhaps with hindsight, I shouldn't have posted as it is causing confusion. This is not a beginners system , as it requires experience and judgement which you can only obtain through time and effort - perhaps years of screentime. And experience and judgement cannot be coded easily into an indicator or EA, so don't expect an indy any time soon! All the details of implementing and trading my Method B are very clearly described in my recent posts. I have held nothing back and there is no "secret". If you want to implement my method, do as follows: (a) Take a clean chart and drop on Fudomyo's template. You will get 57 lines on the chart, 19 monthly, 19 weekly and 19 daily. (b) IMHO, this is too many lines to trade. I want a maximum of 4 lines. If you look at the recent EU chart (attached) you will see that where I very accurately called Wednesday's top at 3939 and Thursday's top at 4027, several of Fudo's lines coincide exactly. His calculations are almost identical to mine so he has saved me the job of writing an indicator for you! (c) OK, so how do we throw away 53 of the 57 lines to be left with just the few that will matter? Here is where you have to do the hard work. As I have explained in several recent posts (in detail, with charts) you need to look back over the recent history on the daily and weekly charts, and identify which lines align with significant price action. This takes time, effort and practice. No short cuts!! (d) If you do this and throw away all the lines that have no significance, you will have a chart identical to mine. If you then trade these few lines, using PA to guide your trades, you will be able to do what I do. That's it. No secret. Just hard work and years of practice. Sorry! Best regards and good luck. Old Dog

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hello Old Dog Thanks for your time and explanations. Sorry for these tiring questions again. One thing is difficult for me to understand. We want a simple method FROM which you started with 6 lines and you want us to start with 57 and bottle down to 6 each day. How many do you start with to end up with 6 (50 or 10). Do you think it is a easy for us to spend hours to eliminate 57 to 6? I have spent 5 years watching price action and I am sure people know watch price action, Any indicator can weekly or monthly like camirally works, but it is how you select which camiralla lines to trade is the secret of success. Instead of making us rely on an indicator, would you mind spending some time for us to explanation of your calculation on how you achieved the top and bottom you mentioned earlier which would make everything easier for everyone. Which is something we can follow for our future analysis. First your inital calculation to get the lines(I am sure it is not 57) and then your analysis set up for filtering those lines. Hope you would not mind my questions!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
It won't take you hours. With practice it will take you minutes! http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/winking.gif Just use some common sense here! Obviously you can eliminate immediately those lines that are hundreds of pips away from the market as the price is not likely to get there for a few days. But remember, even if you have 4 lines on the chart, you need some more "in reserve". In a very trendy month like Setember, the price just went up. So as lines fall off the bottom of the chart, others can be put in at the top. I usually start with a dozen or so lines, calculated from the same numbers Fudo uses: For example, range of the week before last was around 428 pips. Put that in the H4 formula above and you get a line around 1.4027. You can also use standard fib pivots etc. All the formulas you need are on these forums and other web sites. Regards Old Dog

Ok, this is my first time posting and I hope I can help out. I've been trading this method for over 10 years, nothing new here.. I've been to the other thread where this guys thinks he created something. I can tell you straight on, that's not true. this very system is been used for a while, and taught by many companies out there, I had the pleasure of learning this system with some firm that I believe is the best out there, and perhaps, Mrs Abon....ccci did the same.. having that said. what this guy did and I give him credit for that. is find the structure and order of movement, which also is known. by the way. . I can tell you , that my own calculator has almost similar values of OD calc and Abona........cci...... dude.... Having bunch of lines is confusing as traders still don't know which line to buy and which one to sell.. it's starts, like this guys... Pro-money decides to buy and they buy, then they must sell and they sell... the order of the daily cycle. is simply ( BUY DAY..... then Sell Day to take profit, and then they SELL SHORT again and then they BUY to Cover... thats the cycle you need to focus on.. if you knew where in the cycle you are......life would be easy.. before I go on and do blah blah blah many things ... I will post here monday's Possiblities for you to evaluate, if you like what you see. I will tell you guys how ... there are other methods called anchors... I will explain that later... first. EURUSD is bullish and must reach 1.42sss before any turn to the downside, we call that wave 2 extension. I"m not talking about elliot waves or gann........ On Monday.. Price will retrace back down toward 1.3900 and very possbily 1.3870 main buying point on program trading 1.3870 ( BUY PROGRAM, SELL PROGRAM) you can google that........ EU daily moves are either 100 or 125 pips daily. a quick scan at the chart and you can add 100 to the low and 125 to the low, that should project the turn point.... also 100 minus high and 125 minus high... try it.. guys....... why 1.3870?????? well the sentiment is bullish toward 1.42...... right?? pro money dosen't like to drive price against them when buying... they will first advertise selling on the wire to entice traders to sell, and pro money buy all supplies...then turn market back up..in what we call Mark up and take profit phase. so before market goes up, it first must pullback for buying opp........ Monday's levels Upper Limit 1.3900 1.3950 1.4037 if breaks 1.4066 and 1.42ssss Pivotal 1.3870 Lower Limit 1.3835 1.3805 this is monday's road map and possible exention toward Wed.... If market opens higher on monday's that means price will retrace....back down toward 1.3870sss if market opens lower... will first continue lower toward 1.39sss and then bounce back up.. Good Trading for all of you.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
There should be more than 2 lines, If it is Resistance or Support this doesn't mean it cannot be broken any direction.. Simply it has to mean, if broken, then next price target come in play. And if fist line of support/resistance would be broken or not? Question still remains: "Should I buy or should I sell"??? How this is more than 50% chance so far I cannot see it. To translate everything above: There is some important levels, if broken PA will take it to the next level of support or Resistance and if Not broken then price will range, it doesn't look as easy decision to me. Some traders just playing simple Daily Pivot, Sell below, Buy above.. We also have to define what "broken" means??? 2 pips, 10 pips? Hard to say.. (up to now, for me broken means candle should close above R level /below S level and it could be anything 10-40+ pips mainly depends on what TF we are talking about) P.S. Playing line crossings: either Fib, or Trend Lines, or Moving averages, never been easy.. If that was working, then any of us could simply place Few Moving averages (Fast/Slow) and play crossings, but there is SO MANY FALSE crossings that you most certainty going to lose more than win... Could be that OD making money not because of those lines, but because of his huge experience as a trader (or Both), many of those traders simply trading bare charts.. If you doesn't use glasses by now, I guess you gonna be trading right, when you need one.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks Old Dog much better now, So for daily lines you use previous weekly range and previous day close and can I assume for weekly lines you use, monthly range and previous week close and for monthly lines you use previous month close and previous year range?

Hi OD, My apologies for the delay in responding. Thanks for the kind thoughts. Things are heading in a good direction, and I understand this thread is oriented towards a system. If I have anything that I can add, I'll certainly lend a hand, and of course am following along to see what you guys come up with. I think the key is the trigger. When I get back from my trip I have a template for something I'd like to share that you may find interesting. It's a bit different logic structure, but could add an edge for entries and exits. Anyway, best of luck and catch up with you soon.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
G'day squalou, I've put your indi (v 1.4) in IBFX (left) and FXPro (right), and lined them up for comparison and I have adjusted the NY open time so that they start on the correct candle in IBFX to match FXPro, but the levels are way different. It would be good if we can get it working on any broker and I believe that is your intention with the NY_Close_Hour variable. I will have a look at your code to see if I can correct this, but maybe you'd be better at it, as no one knows your code like you! I guess it is probably due to using day or monthly candle times in the calcs and o fix it, you'd have to work on the close of the relevant hourly candles. Broker differences in hourly closes should be minimal. One thing to note, even after this is resolved, is that GMT is the standard and time zones vary with daylight savings and such (and the Internet time servers are often messed up with this - at least for a month each changeover with NSW, Australia anyway). What I was thinking was that we could have the indi display "Current NY time is XX:XX" and tell the user to compare this with http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=179 (that site seems to be able to get it right!). This would make it very easy for a user to adjust the timing on the indi (time offsets confuse the best of us!) Regards, Bigtent.

Guy, How are those of you that are using the Guru/Squalou indicators getting on? Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi Bigtent, Read this... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...9&amp;postcount=91 Essentially, because of the extra "short" day, you will get different phase values and a different midpoint....the midpoint is used in the calcluation and therfore you get a different result. A broker that does not have a "Sunday" is recommended. I'll let squalou indicate whether this can be easily rectified. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I have a tally...will post at end of week. Cheers CanuckCT

Thanks Canuck, Was there a tally for last week? I think i missed it if there was. Regards Lee

--- 帖子 #291 ---
That would indeed do the trick... We have no choice here but to code our own iATR() function Find the first candle of the week, then compute Daily ATR "by hand" by chunks of 24-hours candles... Unless someone already has written that somewhere ?... SQ

--- 帖子 #292 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=217 I'll provide further update at end of this week. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I am looking at your code. I think the iATR function could be replaced. I have the source for it, so it would mean "manufacturing" daily values from hourly candles (loop) and feeding that in... only need the highs and low, so that shouldn't be too hard.... Putting on my thinking cap!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Guys Well, the experiment continues. On Sunday evening I sent LeeMonk and CanuckCT my levels for this week. Although I have 8 numbers in my notebook, I only put 3 on the chart as the others are too far away from the current price. I will add these, and remove existing lines, as the price moves. The relevant levels I sent the guys were: Monthly "A" = 1.3939 (same as last week, of course) Weekly "X" = 1.3890 (same as Fudo's WS1) Weekly "Y" = 1.3781 (same as Fudo's WS4) The price respected these very well, see attached chart. Monday was slow, as the US and Japan were on holiday I believe, so the price came down from the weekly gap open and sat around 3939. It then fell in a single H1 candle to 3890, accurate to the pip. On Tuesday, it retested, then fell to 3781, leaving only 5 pips on the table. It has now bounced back up towards 3890, so these 3 lines are still in play. Note how the two critical weekly lines at 3890 and 3781 coincided with two of Fudo's weekly levels! Just use Fudo's levels, and then throw most of them away as I have described ad nauseam . You will then just be left with a few lines that matter! Best regards and good luck, Old Dog

I was following Fudo's today, and as you say seemed to be right on the mark! You say get rid of most of the lines, what lead you to keeping the 3 lines that you did? I know you mention to look back at previous highs/lows but by doing that it seems most of Fudo's lines will be valid to a certain extent? Regards Rump.

Guys ...and so it goes on. Pip-perfect trading!! Regards Old Dog PS. These are real-time updates!! How many other systems put their money where their mouth is like this?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Yes, not too difficult, if you do decide to code it, I think it would be best as a function so it can be dropped into their code more efficiently and use less CPU for look ups in the iCustom(). Another way might be to just use TimeDayOfWeek(Time[i]) In a for loop with a if statement that will collect the Daily range for the day if TimeDayOfWeek(Time[i]) != 0. Then the for loop "i" can be set to an extern input for the periods to consider as in iATR and Then just divide the accumulated Daily Ranges by that same extern input period number.

...and again, back to Weekly "O". Even "the Bastard" (GBPJPY) is trying to behave itself! Regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Indrek, I am still 'working' my way through the screening process of which lines to keep and which to remove. What does seem to work well is where there is confluence. So, even if you do not really want all the monthlies, it may well be worth a look to at least keep those that line up with the weeklies that you do like. Just a though............ Regards Lee

For anyone who is using Squalou's indicator for trading the breakouts at NY close, I have the close at 1.3961 but Breakout 1 to go long (green box) is at 1.3945 resulting in price being above the BO1 at the start of the new day. Does anyone else have the same?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
When I see this I wait for price to come back to pivot. Cheers CanuckCT

OD, Like the lines.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Well done, BarneyDog!! I can see you are really cracking the essence of this system! Everyone - take a look at Barney's chart. You will learn a lot. As CanuckCT will verify, the "higher" levels I sent him on Sunday were 1.4000 (weekly open) and 1.4110 (predicted from Fudo's WR5 and adjusted slightly for historical PA). EU behaved itself flawlessly. Also GBPUSD is well behaved. I am up just over 11% this week, so a very happy puppy!! Regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks Barney, Ive had a few questions based on these Fib strategies but that one chart answers a lot of them. Regards.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Mr OD, Spot on. Now I need to go back and follow how you and Fudo trade the lines. Just a note for others .... 1.4110 (predicted from Fudo's WR5 and adjusted slightly for historical PA) .... ties in with with 123.6 on the attachment below. BD

--- 帖子 #306 ---
You are very welcome. Hopefully it was the Week response that helped. and and And OD's comments.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I think it may be a nice drill to use your fib layout to try set targets: how about 1.42600 ?

The U.S. dollar weakened further against its major currency counterparts, with the EUR/USD rallying to a high of 1.4121 on Thursday, and the bearish momentum behind the greenback may carry into the end of the week as investors expect the Fed to expand monetary policy further. As EUR/USD breaks out of the narrow range from earlier this week, we are likely to see the pair continue to retrace the decline from earlier this year, and euro-dollar looks poised to make a run at 1.4440-50, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement from the 2009 high to the 2010 low, as price action holds steadily above the 61.8% Fib around 1.3890-1.3900. With the 50-Day moving average (1.3158) approaching the 200-Day SMA at 1.3165, the bullish crossover suggests that the exchange rate will continue to push higher throughout the month, but there could be a corrective retracement in the coming days as the recent rally remains overbought. Given the strong bearish sentiment underlying the greenback, we would need the RSI to fall back below 70 to see a pullback in the exchange rate, and the rally may carry into the following week as the index bounces back to 78.

Message to Squalou, The sentiment calculation in your indicator always shows higher than the pivot. I believe guru's indicator does show negative sentiment at times. Can you check the calculation to see that it is correct? And if it is, perhaps guru could comment on how he is calculating sentiment. I've updated the stats for the breakout trades from Oct 1 to today. I have made no provision for moving to BE. It's either a winner or a loser. Cheers CanuckCT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi to everyone on this thread and thanks to CanuckCT for allowing me to take part. I will be interested to try out the Old Dogs indicator when finished, it will enable me to compare my Dynamic levels with the very accurate lines I have seen occurring on every chart. If it pans out as I hope and I am permitted to post a graphic of my method, it may be that others may derive additional insights. l know that I have already learnt so much just from reading this thread. Regards to all. Allon

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I'm pretty close on this.....sometime this weekend or early next week. The way this thread is evolving is this....there is a mechanical approach using the squalou and guru indicators to identify entry point from a pivot level using Old Dog's calculation. The second approach will require some more finesse....you will need to decide which levels are important and which are not. I expect this week to have a full discussion about the process. Cheers CanuckCT Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Great job Canuck, old dog, coders...! The pivots are very similar (same?) as Fudomyo`s . I like the yearly pivots feature, perfect for long term trading.

Not entirely happy with the old dog pivots....don't like waiting for markets to open to draw the levels. That fix is in the works. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I wanted to add one thought, the template and indicators I posted on my thread gives the W/M levels for the FZ pivots, so it comes down to personal preference which style of look back people prefer. (the Shorelines uses historical levels for each rollover versus a straight line on the chart) For anyone who is using this version, I wanted to share this Daily version that only has the Daily Pivot and the 50-61 zone. (I find these to be the most useful Daily levels). The Current Weekly EU FZ pivot point level is 13976 and the Monthly EU FZ pivot point level is 13630. It's a good idea to check your pivot point after you set up your chart to make sure the FZ levels are set properly. Cheers

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Thanks to both of you... I appreciate it a lot...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Old Dog (et al) many thanks for sharing your work and thoughts here. Please could someone confirm if these levels are accurate on this chart? I am using FXPro and it appears to be running at GMT+3, so I have entered an hourly offset of 3 in each of the Old Dog pivots, is that right? Other bits on the chart are swingmans MTF and Fudo's new D1 levels which look interesting to me.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I have been trading fibos for a while in the conventional manner. But what you guys(OD, CT, BD, SQ, Guru,Fudomyo- did I miss anyone?) have done in a few short days (which for some began a few years ago, I know) is fantastic. You showed me new ways to look at fibos and S/R. Thanks for that. As a man-of-the-cloth, I speak blessings over you all for what you have done and shared with your neighbors. Your gifts, talents and helping attitude toward others is what it is truly about! Thanks for allowing me in. If you have prayer request, let me know....I can do that...LOL.

A snapshot of levels Old Dog on the left...CanuckCT on the right I have a short video of my process...once uploaded to YouTube...will post the link. You need to think is it this way....identify support and resistance by first looking at a fib calculation based on the close of the prior period...and then looking at historical price action for the prior week...and the last time price crossed through the current range.

hi CanuckCT, Just curious what's the difference between the CanuckCT levels and my levels? They look the same. My weekly levels are the black dotted lines, monthly are white dotted lines, WPV is W0 on my chart. Cheers, Fudo

I had this indicator and was tinkering with it....but could not get it to work. It does h4, daily, weekly and monthly...plus midpivots...when you activate everything you cannot see the chart. It uses some type of array function....I'm wondering if one of you clever folks can adjust the array function to accept a pivot and 9 levels up and nine levels down for each of weekly, monthly and daily....then we can do this in one indicator....and that would simplify things considerably. Cheers CanuckCT

The old dog pivot indicator is no longer functioning now that we're in the month of November. I would fix it, but I'm not a programmer. Any volunteers?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Try these...just remember that you need to enter the high low close for weekly at the beginning of the week, the high low close for monthly at the beginning of the month and the high low close at the beginning of the year. This should fix the issue for now....the solution to do this automatically in a single indicator is in progress. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks CanuckCT, Ya it would really be appreciated, if you could come up with an indi that updated the pivots every month.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Indicator Need someone who can program a little.......there are two indicators, that, when combined, will do what we need. The first one does the yearly pivot calculation.... The second one does weekly and monthly pivots Neither does all the levels....but the second one uses arrays and accordingly can draw many lines on the chart. We just need to use the array properly....and adjust how it draws the lines. Basically, need a pivot and nine levels up and nine levels down....and have it based on Y, MN or W1 as the input. Then 3 instances of the indicator will do what we need it to do. Is there anyone who can do this....I'm thinking we use the second indicator as the base and use the yearly calculation from the first one. Chat Room Is there any interest in setting up a chat room....I think I have a clever way to do it and have a rooms be pair specific... Trading Forex full time can be a bit lonely as there is no office to go to...and quite frankly, any of the chat rooms I've visited are pretty awful. Maybe someone can point me to a good one. Otherwise, I think we could do a good job on one....me thinks there is a need for it. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #362 ---
i could participate in a chat room. but i'd love to see someone like old dog, who has extensive experience in the room as well.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Here is a much better pivot...one for the month and one for the week...just drop on a chart. I have another pivot indicator that does yearly calculations....but it it still requires 3 instances of the indicator. I'll post later, after I'm finished reviewing it. Cheers CanuckCT

Hello, all, I am still here - been away for a few days R&amp;R!! As you all know, I have been in this business a long time but it wasn't until I ventured into this public forum that anyone asked me to coach them. At first, I was somewhat reticent to do this as I am not sure what I have to offer, other than long experience, which is hard to teach. However, one very persistent young trader contacted me and asked me to mentor him. I will not give his name in a public forum to save him embarrassment -- he can come forward and "own up" if he wants to http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/big_grin.gif . He had been trying FX for around six months when he contacted me. He had done quite a bit of reading, but had "read too much" and had a mish-mash of a number of different systems in his head. We have been on Skype several times a week for hour+ sessions for around a month now. In that time, he has come on leaps and bounds. He started very confused indeed, sending me charts that Skyzer would call a "zebra" there were so many lines!! Now, through sheer hard work and application of a few basic principles, I sincerely believe that he is in a position to trade with confidence and be consistently profitable. He has all his ideas clear in his head and is now sending me charts with his trading decisions for my assessment. He has all but cracked this! I cannot tell you delighted I am, both for him and his young family in these difficult times. But I am also very aware of the sheer amount of my time this has taken, preparing demo charts etc like a college professor! In short........ I am very happy to take part in a "chat room" if you think I can help, but I am very loathe to give over my whole life (I have less of it left than most of you!). I don't want to be selfish and I genuinely want to help, but I hope you all understand that I don't want FF to be my life http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/big_grin.gif . Best regards Old Dog

--- 帖子 #368 ---
It is really nice of you to teach an young person so that he can take care of his family. There are not too many people in this world who would do that. Thanks and hope one day many more can learn from you, may be on chat room. It is what we leave and do for others , than what we accumulate and alas, leave this world with nothing to show for. Thanks for your Generosity Kris

--- 帖子 #377 ---
OD's approach and the indies certainly make you think harder about key levels, whether they be fib or standard pivot based...in the process i'm beginning to see price more from a supply/demand perspective. Today's GU chart for instance, prior to the inflation report price was fairly evenly balanced (in terms of supply/demand) and ranging, but looking back to yesterday there were a few significant/obvious supply levels to aim for should the news break price long (which it did)... In terms of entry, i waited for price to break above the 1st supply line which was also around today's pivot and entered long once the level was tested and price bounced...so i'm in from 6059, have an initial tgt of 97 (around the 138.2 ext of the news swing) where i'll take 50% off, stops are now at b/e and if it has the legs i'm looking for the supply around 6150 to take the remaining lots off....i can dream

Hi Old Dog I genuinely want to participate in any chat room in which you would be involved. I understand you don't want this to take over your life, but as it seems you have the ability to get someone up and running to trade as per your style within 1 month, I think it need not require much more than this to get a hard core of good traders involved who can take over the reins as you withdraw. While I wouldn't want to volunteer Canuck for anything, he has already proved his ability to pick up an idea and run with it, and is obviously a giver, as this thread shows. I would have confidence in his involvement, and others of his ilk, so you would not necessarily be on your own. There's at least another pint of Old Speckled Hen at stake here, and I also have a fine Chianti from a fattoria in Toscana, an organic medal winner, next time you're north of the border and back in GOC.

Here is how I'm using the Old Dog pivots. First, I've removed the 0.10 and 0.16 and added 0.125 and 0.875 The levels that i focus on are weekly and monthly 38.2, 0.50 and 61.8 mostly. A couple of charts...

Canuck: At what time do your week/day begin? I have small level differences with your lines. Other thing, is it possible to add the possibility to modify the line type? Thanks

--- 帖子 #382 ---
It's possible my numbers are slightly different...it is not FXPro . I can't reconcile those numbers....they should be real close across brokers as far as the High/Low goes...but the month close or week close could be off a little....there is an hour offset in the indicator....I am not adjusting mine...so that may be the difference. For the line type....you can change the thickness easily...as far as the line type goes, you'll have to go into the code and change that. Locate STYLE_SOLID" and change it to what you need. Cheers CanuckCT

Hi Canuck /Old Dog, Have you decided on a chat room yet? I swear by the levels and concepts you posted, and would love to take my learning on this further if the opportunity avails itself. If you have already formed a group, and I was not one of the chosen participants - that's ok; just wanted to check in on this. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I'll talk with Old Dog about this....one option is to create a Skype room....and just leave it open all the time. This has worked in the past. Those who want to drop in and discuss trades, can do it. Not pressure to call trades, but a place to share some intraday setups for many pairs. If I coordinate such a room, it won't be to call trades for people. I'll share some of my trade setups...and my expectation is that others will as well. But Skype can be a distraction to looking at charts...and idle chatter. It it turns into a place for idle chatter, that would be a problem. Cheers CanuckCT

Hi tsidki, Here is a zip with my main trading chart. You will see that I use the old dog weekly and monthly pivots with a slight change in the values. In addition I use a band indicator to gauge the swings. In downtrend, I like to take sell trades that come off the upper band and the reverse for buy trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I also use the TrendMagic to time my entry on M5. That usually gets me in with a small stop. That's not on my chart here as it really is a different system than trading with just the pivots and price action. I use a hybrid of each that seems to fit my eye. Cheers CanuckCT

Hello All, I have Edited the indi "sqAbonacciOldDogLevels-indi.mq4". I hope that Old Dog give me his opinion. The manual base line number that you will find is based on my calculations Is 1.2940, Mainly it's based on the usage of the ATR 44 on daily and 1H charts As Old Dog Discribed before and you can change that number to any number Without using the "." (example 1.2940 you type it 12940) . and it's not "aebab" base line of Dec 1.3040. I hope the indi will be useful. I Added the following: 1) Manual Phase Range(size) 2) Manual Base Line Number Best regards tsidki.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hello tsidki Thanks for this very useful contribution! I am sure those folk who are getting their levels each month/week will find this an easy way to get them onto their charts. You mention 1.2940 as your December baseline. To compliment that, I am currently working with a "phase gap" of 133 pips. I have had some nice PA off these levels already on a few occasions. Best of luck with your trading, Very best regards, Old Dog

--- 帖子 #395 ---
tsidki, how did you calculate the monthly base level?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
what I get for the base line, using the spreedsheet attached here is: 1,2915 So not sure how tsidki have this. hope he can explain. To "Old Dog" Calculation of phase interval, as you explained here for aug/sept calculation, i have the PEAK of ATR on sept of 0.0047 on sept. 28. So its far away from your value... What's wrong with my ATR? Thanks a lot! http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/...209_162700.jpg

Hello all, I am still getting the PMs and emails rolling in from folk who are convinced I have a "secret sauce" up my sleeve that I am not sharing with the forum. Well, I have and I haven't! Many traders are asking me how I "calculate" this and "calculate" that, such as "base lines" and "phase gaps" etc. Well, I don't. I never have. Please let's kill this one dead now . The market cannot be reduced to a formula . If it could, it would have been discovered years ago and jumped on by every trader going. What you can compute is things like profit targets etc. These are simply a function of recent volatility. In a raging market, TPs can be higher than in a slow market. Common sense. That is all my calc does. Nothing else. If you want to trade like I do with an absolute maximum of 6 horizontal lines on my chart and nothing else , then just look where the price reacted in the recent past. See the attached illustration. If you mark these lines on your chart, you will see the market still reacts to past levels. And couple that with simple PA and you will have everything you need. It is pretty obvious where price stalled, spent a lot of time, support-turned resistance, etc etc. The market has a real memory for these levels! You should look back on H4 and D1 charts for several months and you will find these. The more you look, the easier it gets. Practice is everything, as usual. The magenta line in the diagram shown one obvious place. There is potentially another that may become significant "left as an exercise for the reader". As you get more and more years behind you as a trader, you will begin to realise something else. The actual lines themselves are not that important. Around 15 years ago I was at a trading convention and I saw something I will never forget. In those days there were none of these new-fangled flat-screen monitors, it was proper glass CRT screens. (I still have a great 24inch CRT monitor but it weighs 118 lb so I can't move it any more.) There was a star trader there making a point. One guy took a ruler and a chinagraph pencil and draw a random line on the glass of the screen. The star trader traded off that line all afternoon and made good money. It was a lesson I will never forget. Very best regards, Old Dog

CanuckCT thanks for sharing, especially the triangular ma bands. "Bolts" right on to my current swing trading methodology - very useful.
