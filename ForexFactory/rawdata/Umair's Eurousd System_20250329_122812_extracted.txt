Indicators Which I Normally Use!!! P-SAR = Default. (On Candlestick Chart Only) MACD = 5, 34 , 5 ( On Candlestick Chart Or Default Style...which gives You clear view of its two lines crossing).... SSTO(Stochastic Slow) = 5 , 3 , 3 Other Chart Users!!! RSI &amp; ATR = RSI = 7 With the combination of ATR 20(In a Same Window)…. MT4 Users only!!! Set RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14 coz pplz complaining that my setting of RSI=7 &amp; ATR=20 not working the same which i want on their MT4 charts...But it must be looking same like my settings....(See posts with screenshots on Page 8,9,10,22)...Also see my Post No (321, 324) Better MT4 users post me screenshorts for more confirmation from me ...coz some of MT4 Users suits RSI=7 &amp; ATR=20 &amp; Some suits RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14....Better to confirm from me... Time Frame= 30 Minutes Only. Pairs = Euro/Usd (Recommended) = Gbd/Jpy (My Experience with this Pair is not much but I got always +ve results...1st try this on Demo).... = Usd/Chf (My Experience with this Pair is not much but i got always +ve results...1st try this on demo)..... Entry Rules Enter only when Two lines of MACD On chart crosses each and The 1st P-SAR dot appears below the candle for long &amp; viceversa for short also SSTO lines have crossed each before, After or with MACD,s two lines Crossing or almost very near to cross if other conditions are already met, but watchout SSTO for not already in a overbought/Oversold Region, For long SSTO must not already In a overbought Region &amp; vice-Versa for Short . Even SAR dot appears or not or all signals are Confirmed or not. Dont enter until SSTO is in a proper position for long and short respectively. for more see screenshots below…. You can also Enter if SAR dots are already below candle and macd,s lines crossed each and heading towards upside for long and ssto lines have also crossed each but not on or near over bought region for long and vice-versa for short. Also For Long RSI =7 Must be Crossing ATR=20 Upward in its Combination or Already have crossed It upward or very near to cross &amp; Vice-Versa for Short... NOTE: When SSTO Is crossed before MACD lines Crossing and MACD lines are very near to cross then Ready yourself and wait for MACD lines Crossing. Also watch RSI &amp; ATR Combinations Movement. When MACD lines is Crossed then note the P-SAR Dots. They must be according to MACD/SSTO Crossing. For Long &amp; Short… Exit Rules I Normally Exit after taking 15/20 Pips profit per trade if opposite P-SAR Dot appears or not in E/U but you can exit in the appearance of opposite P-SAR Dot…. A) Go long When Two lines of MACD Crossed each &amp; SSTO lines Have also Crossed each in upward direction and P-SAR Dot Appears below the candles at the same time or after the crossing or before crossing for long &amp; Vice-Versa for short Also Rsi Have already crossed ATR or very near to cross for long &amp; short respectively.… B) T-P = 15/20 Pips Depends on SSTO &amp; RSI Overbought and oversold condition….(Important to Monitor for Taking Profit)… C) SL = -20 Pips D) I Use SSTO Crossing for confirmation of MACD lines Crossing &amp; for right entry &amp; also to avoide false signals as I have mentioned detail above how and also for Overbought/Oversold Conditions. E) You can get almost 30/40 Pips with this system ON E/U but 15/20 pips are secure pips and easy to get. As Im almost generating 15/20 pips on routine Basis. Watch out overbought/Oversold Conditions and take Profit more then 15/20 pips according to them. F) Never enter Before MACD lines Crossing each (Important). G) I Use the combination of RSI = 7 &amp; ATR = 20 for Additional confirmation of MACD lines crossing &amp; to avoide from false entries. For Long Rsi=7 is has already crossed ATR=20 in Upward direction or very near to cross in its combination &amp; vice-versa for Short. When MACD lines are near to cross each then by the help of other indicators I can easily judge that MACD lines will must cross each or not and also incase when you will put this combination on chart then you will know how its working in your favor But professional traders use lot of indicators for good trades and confirmations for Longs and Shorts… H) All Mentioned Conditions Must Be Met. I) Im using that System from past 5/6 months and its giving me healthy results.. J) Thanks to the efforts of peoples free system contributions as I have learned a lot from them... K) I think stay away before and after half hour of news is Batter… L) I never tried this system on any other timeframe or on any other pair Accept G/J ,U/C, E/U, &amp; N/U so I don’t have any knowledge that how this system works on other pairs or any other time frame… M) I Use FXCM free Power charts from their site !!! Currency Exchange Chart You can find all Required indicators and their conditions to met from their….Like putting MACD on candlestick chart not below window. As the main purpose of putting MACD on candlestick chart is that we can clearly see its lines crossing each with wide view…Otherwise if your charting package is giving u clear view of crossing on normal view or default view( Window below candlestick charts) then no need to put MACD On charts with candlestick… ScreenShot No-01... See below in the pic. that how all conditions to enter in a trade met!!! 1) Look at Macd,s two signal lines on candlestick chart as they have crossed each and heading towards downside...(1st signal) 2) SSto have just crossed and heading towards downside----(2nd-signal).... 3) First P-Sar dot appears above the candle which is a ( 3rd-signal)... 4)See the combination of RSI/ATR as RSI has already Crossed ATR &amp; heading towards downside(4tH-Signal).... 5)See how market moves down and we can happily lock +50 pips on Euro/Usd.... Also see the screeshot carefully..Here i entered in the appearance of First SAR dot above the candle for short coz other conditions are already met as RSI has already crossed ART and heading towards downside, SSTO was also crossed each lines &amp; heading towards downside...Also Look at the left side of mentioned signal with blue line...Just one day back Macd,s lines are crossing and heading towards upside, ssto is crossing and heading towards upside , Blue line of RSI Just touched ATR &amp; then moved towards upside and before our entry it was already on upside. Sar dots are below the candle and tht was a valid entry and i managed to get very goood pips also from there.... Now lets Move Towards ScreenShot No.02!!! That is the screenshot of Gbd/Jpy....In that trade i managed to Get +40 pips!!! 1) See How tow lines of MACD crossed each &amp; heading towards downside...(1st Signal)... 2)P-SAR dot appears above the candle(2nd-Signal)... 3)SSTO Lines crossed each &amp; heading towards downside(3rd signal).... 4)See the 2nd fig. carefully Rsi was near to cross ATR when the first sar dot appears but i didnt enter but was not very near so i wait and when 2nd SAR dot appear above RSI was about to cross ATR &amp; i enter Short....See the 2nd red candle with blue line &amp; arrow...See how market moved down &amp; Give +40 pips even more but i close my position here..... My System is Basically for EURO/USD But its also working very well on GBD/JPY but i,ll recommend you more on EURO/USD....Coz I have tested it on that pair from last 5/6 months.... ScreenShot No-03 Perfect G/J Entry!!! Now Look at screenshot no. 3 that is the one of the perfect G/J entry i ever met.... 1)See two lines of MACD Clearly crossed each &amp; heading downside(1st Short signal)... 2)Then P-SAR dot appears above the candle after it completation of Long signal series... 3) Blue Line of RSI =7 Crossed Red Line of ATR=20 already &amp; Heading downside Even more strong signal. Coz RSI=7 Already Crossed It... 4)SSTo have crossed Each from overbought region &amp; heading downside....Even most strongest signal coz it was almost in a Overbought region and heading towards downside..... All Conditions are perfectly met and i Managed to get +100 pips...+47 on Real and remaining on Demo....See the 3rd Important Screen shot that how i entered with blue line with arrow and with first SAR Short signal Dot.... ScreenShot No. 04 News Candles &amp; False Signals!!! I really hate the crucial news time....The Only time i fail whn i mistakenly enter in a news time &amp; +ve conditions immediately &amp; i must say amazingly becomes -ve for me...Dont enter here tht was almost 80-100 pips move but RSI &amp; ATR was even not crossed or not even near to cross coz news immediatly creats different condition....Althouh Macd, SSTO &amp; SAR signaling long &amp; as i said 80-100 pips move but i just stay away and just watch all that wht was happening...Lolllzzz.....Dont Kill urself Here,,,,watchout.... ScreenShot No . 05 See SSTO &amp; and your entry!!! What h appened here see urself!!! 1) Two lines of MACD crossed each &amp; heading towards upside...(Long signal)... 2) Rsi=7 already crossed ATR =20 and Already in upside (2nd long signal).... 3) SAR Also signaling long (3rd long signal).... 4) Look at SSTO.... Already in a overbought region....Question is that...here we enter for long or not ....? That is the common question that most of the pplz ask....See urself ...In EURO/USD i really avoide to enter in that kind of situations but here i enter in G/J but just for 10-pips profit...but G/J moved upto +24pips....Then see the next candle....A red Candle....G/J Moved down just bcz ssto was in a overbought region....Although G/J was after that make an uptrend and give lot of pips if we wait there holding our position...But frankly speaking even i was not sure for that , That G/J will maintain his uptrend. Even not from four hours chart...So i also avoide to enter in these sort of situations....Coz i never want to make even a singal wrong entry....I know that i,ll find lot of other apportunities....So Thats all for Know!!! Precautions!!! A voide to enter in a dead Market Specially In Euro/Usd.... Avoide to enter before &amp; After half hour of News.... SSTO is important to monitor before entry for long &amp; Short.... I have No experience of my system on other pair Only have a goood experience on E/U &amp; Now G/J &amp; U/C ...But my experience on G/J is just of 16/17 successful trades...Luckly my SL of -20 pips on G/J Didnt hit yet... Hope these screenshots from my digital cam. helps u lolzzz coz dont know Why and what problem i am having to scan screenshots ..... Suggestions are needed &amp; wellCome.... So lets talk about some tips to generate some Pips!!! Thank You very Much.... Umair ....Goood Luck....

Hey Man profibality of system depends on u....as i have mentioned that i normally lock 15/20 pips profit and out from my trade but u can get more than 15/20 pips i mean almost 30/40 pips ...listen carefully how!!! when ssto is in overbought condition or at 75 and crosses their or crosses whereever else at 75 or more then 75 , 80, 90 then wait for macd to cross also when macd crosses also after ssto crossing i mean inthe range of 90---75 and p-sar dot appears above for short then close your eyes and enter for short for 30/40 pips euro/usd 30-mints timeframe chart....

Dear friends: what is the SSTO REgards

--- 帖子 #16 ---

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hey it seems that ur news to forex.... well SSTO Means Stohastic Slow ....Your charting package must be providing that indicator....Go to ur charts indicators and select Stohastic Slow and set it to 5, 3, 3..... Some charts have just two points option then inthat case set it to 5,3..... Hope u understand that....

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hello, excuse me but what that means : RSI crossed or MACD crossed ? crossed zero line ? thak you for sharing your system. excuse me for newbie question.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hey!!! I just close my position on GBD/JPY 30-mints and getting +25 pips....

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hey Jaguar!!! Loook FIRst set macd to 5, 34, 5 ok then loook you will see two lines on MACD Histogram crossing each time to time....Ok if your new then im telling you the simple way to use my system..... 1) When MACD,s two lines crossed each then look Ssto ...it must also have to crossed before or with macd lines crossing... 2) After crossing of two lines of MACD wait for SAR Dot to appear ... 3) Sell if SAR Dot appears above candles and c the crossing of macd lines ...they were heading towards downside after crossing and ssto also have crossed and heading towards downside....and viceversa... 4) Never enter in a position for sell if ssto is already oversold....The main purpose of ssto is to avoide false signals and vice-versa for buy... 5) If ur new then for your ease forget about RSI &amp; ATR combination and also RSI alone.... 6) Just concentrate on the process i have mentioned now.... Hope u understand....

--- 帖子 #21 ---

Hey everything is ok with ur chart but only the wrong thing is macd...as ur using macd,s histogram chart...no lines crossing is there....use macd chart with lines crossing....i,ll tomorrow post myscreenshots... use charts in which default macd is used with two lines and histogram and set its setting then to 5, 34, 5....as u can clearly c tht how market is giving pips after the appearance of first sar dot appearance...if incase ur chart provide the facility of two lines crossing then u,ll get a strong sell signal as 1) two macd lines are crossed towards downsides, 2) ssto have also crossed and heading towards downside 3) sar dot is above the candle after crossing of lines of both macd and ssto and mkt is yet gives us +25 pips since from morining and from which i manage to lock +17 today

[quote=fxhaz;1699012]Do you still look at higher TF like 1H and 4H to determine the longer trend or you just look at 30min Tf only. Frankly Speaking i never tried much this system on more then 30 minutes timeframe....But im using this system from last 5/6 months and its giving me very healthy results on 30 minutes timeframe....Sometimes i manage to get +40 pips also per single trade and more in a same day....My main pair is EURO/USD and i made this system specially for tht pair and result are 90% and only i found myself fail whn i mistakenly enter during news time and my SL of 20 pips hit....Otherwise try urself....On 30-Mints TF On euro/usd and gbd/jpy....Try this system with 100% on real account on euro/usd 30-mints TF but Othertimeframes try this on ur own risk....Coz i have 5/6 months strong experience on 30-mints ....practice on demo with more thn 30 mints tf and let me know its results.....

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hello Umairs2004, Thank you for sharing your system. I would just like to know how long have you been trading this system, and is that on demo or live account? Thank You.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi2 Tenex!!! You have put all indicators correctly except MACD....I think u r also using MT4 PLatform....U need a macd with two lines coz ur right now using macd histrogram...coz take a look at ur own image....when ssto crossed, then 1st sar dot appears above the candle look at ur chart market moved down almost 40-pips now....Sounds gr8....? But where is the third and most strong signal of macd crossing...? I said in my thread all conditions must met then enter.... If ur charting package is not froviding u Macd crossing then visit!!! http://www.fxcm.com/charting-options.jsp fxcm ,s power chart u,ll find all my requirments there.... if u still wana use mt4 then use cms forex brokers free mt4 charts then onthier mt4 charting package macd with two lines are available.... Dont worry buddy i,ll must post screenshots today anytime or tomorrow at first time....u,ll clear ...onthe other hand u have used all indicators right but only macd is not metting our condition....But c tht how market gets down ....+50 pips....today gr8 trade today

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I have mention the answer of ur question in my thread... anyways im using tht system from last 5/6 months and its giving me healthy results.....Just avoide to enter in a news time before and after half hour of news.... C todays result +50 pips on euro/usd.... Almost +180 pips on gbd/jpy...But i,ll recommend u to trade only on euro/usd 30mints tf....coz i have 5/6 months experience on it...im testing gbd/jpy....and today my system generates +180 pips...on 30 mints tf.....C urself on ur charts according to my system....Im testing this pair on demo .....on real i manage to get +47 pips on tht pair...on demo +180....C charts with my system Happy pips....

--- 帖子 #50 ---
On Real i manage to get!!! +17 -Pips on Euro/Usd-----But Market Moved down to +50 pips(Demo) +47 -pips on Gbd/Jpy---- But Market moved down to +180 pips(Demo) TF= 30 Mints.... I know that on real i can get more pips on real but never greedy for pips. Become greedy for your healthy strong performance..... Think if u manage to generate 20-pips per day than at the end of month u,ll manage to produce 20-pips * 22 trading days = 440 pips at the end of month..... I start tht strategy whn i start trading....Now im confidence to generate more pips.... Takecarzzz

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Here is a MACD with the lines.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hi Umairs2004, thanks for posting your method. I'm trying to follow your entry earlier on EUR/USD...please could you confirm if this was your entry candle? Thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
ChowClown!!! My entry candle was first left of candle you r pointing with first sar dot.... Remenber always enter when ssto crossed each, macd lines ccross each and first sar dot appears...but try to avoide from false signals Thank u very much....for ur screenshot...it seems ur using fxcm chart...do u do one goood thing in my favour...lot of ppls here want me to post screen shot where im have some problem to scan it....can u post the same screen shot again with macd on chart with candles not window below like u now posted in ur screenshot....Ssto 5, 3, 3, Rsi with 7 and combination of Rsi=7 and ATR=20....coz main purpose of putting macd with crossing lines on candle chart is tht pplz can clearly c its crossing....Kindly do response me in the favour of me and pplz here....thankzzz Nd dont forget to post the same screenshot here with the requirments i have tell with entry signal with first sar dot....im waiting....Remember entry is with first sar dot....

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Put MACD with crossing with candles on chart coz fxcm,s charts is providing tht option...when u select macd and set it 5,34,5 then dont put it as new...enter the option inthe same dialog box shows as overly=euro/usd.... then put other indicators same like u have put in ur screenshot...and put the blue point out line onthe candle left with first sar dot. or onthe left neighbour candle of the candle on which u have pointed to enter....

--- 帖子 #55 ---
hi umair, do u hav any idea or system toward gbp-usd?? coz ur euro-usd is a distintive system.. thx..

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Ya u can use my system on Gbd/jpy and gbd/usd but first try it on demo...but only on 30-mints tf....coz less thn can result in false signals....Im posting its results like today i have posted the result of Gbd/jpy=+180 pips i,ll post the results of gbd/usd sooon but i think im expert in euro/usd and its results are outstanding....put my system on ur charts and go back to histry and c the results of gbd/usd......

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Umair2004, hope this is correct.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thank you ChowClown !!! This is absolutly correct c how!!! 1) Macd have already crossed....and heading towards downside (1-Signal) 2)SSTO have just crossed and heading towards downside with macd,s lines crossing ( 2-Signal) 3) Then first sar dot appears above candle (3-rd siganl) and last signal So u enter and u can c how u can getting pips!!! All three important conditions to enter in a trade met....never enter if any of condition didnt met.... 4) For ur ease c the combination of RSI/ATR they r also heading towards downside.....( More confirmation) +50 pips are ur,s...... Happy pips and Goood luck,,,, Coz thats all is about my system....right now im sighning off....i,ll be back after one hour.... Plz let the people know on my behalf that its the right and excat screenshot for enty....

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Umair, we're now approaching a long...PSAR to 'dot' soon perhaps. Next news an hour away, if it signals would you take it?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
...Long Umair triggered - interesting to note the Inside Candle an hour earlier, as the MACD and Stochs crossed.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hey dont enter if it gives u even a valid signals coz news is just coming after almost half an hour but make sure that macd,s lines crosses , ssto crosses and psar dot appears below then enter but make sure ssto is not already in overbought condition...otherwise it will be a false signal or u may manage to get just 5/10 pips profit.... But see ur just posted screenshot....No condition is yet properly met Look Just macd,s two lines have crossed each and heading towards upward but ssto is alsready is overbought region dont enter for long coz rsi also didnt yet crossed atr 20 towards upside....Just aviode to enter in a false signals...All conditions must met to enter remeber that...

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Everyone if ur ready for long signals then 1) Macd lines must be crossed and heading towards upside... 2) Ssto are also crossed and heading towards upside Important to Note!!! SSTO may not already in a overbought regin or heading toward downside.... 3) Sar dot appears below the candle then enter for long....but only watching ssto and the combination of RSI/ATR.... 4)Stay away from news timing like now after half an hour news will be announced....

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Is it necessary that we enter on the first PSAR dot? I notice that sometimes when we get our MACD cross there are already two or three SAR dots. I hope I am clear with my question. Thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Again +19 pips on euro/usd at 1-Gmt candle. Macd,s signal lines crosses each, sar dot appears below the candle for long but ssto was apporaching towards overbought region....So tht was a valid signal but only for few pips as ssto was almost at overbought...Euro/Usd gives us +19 pips before bouncing back....&amp; its happened. Coz ssto was almost in overbought region...Look at 1-Gmt candle at 30 mints tf according to my system.... Then immediatly the next candle was just before the news and i closed my position....But this time i entered in a trade on demo as already i got + 17 &amp; + 47 pips on real and that trade was a practice trade on demo.... Let see wht will happened next but im hopeful tht the pair will move up more after ssto again make its move towards upside....

--- 帖子 #65 ---
BillBss Ya ur right it happened most of times!!! But only enter whn!!! Short= when macd crosses and heading towards downside ssto have already crossed or crossed with macd,s crossing or near to cross and not in a oversold region and after all that third step is to wait for sar dot to appear above ur candle when its appears above ur candle go short but watch out for ssto it must not be in already in oversold otherwise it will be a false signal or maybe u manage to get just few pips profit like i said in my last post....and vice-versa for long...Becouse if and only if all conditions are met almost at the sametimes then pips will be yours.... And for the answer of ur question that if we have our macd crosses two/three sar dots r already there then intht condition c ssto coz if already suppose sar dots are signaling short and macd,s lines crosses and heading towards downside then c ssto it must also have to crossed with/before or near to macd crossing and must have to heading downside...but listen inthat case dont wait for long positions profit just 10/15 pips ok and vice-versa for long.... Hope u understand....Now loook at ur charts of euro/usd its heading again upside and more pips again.....

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I think I understand. Is this correct: I may enter several SAR dots into the trade as long as the MACD and SSTO are in the proper condition and as long as I only go for 10/15 pips? Thank you

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Man if Already several sar dots are there and macd and ssto is in proper positin according to ur sar dots thn its ok u can enter but just for few pips...10/15 coz tht condition is not according to my rulzz but its valid coz i c tht condition lot of time but u c the histry for more detail go back to ur chart and c ur self how much ur question can fully satisfied u by given answers....

--- 帖子 #68 ---
BillBss!!! See the screenshot of my thread....see the one day back process series of sar dots were signaling long i didnt enter but then one sar dot appers on upside of candle and soon after tht macd,s ssto crossed and heading towards upside and the next sar dot was again appears below the candle and tht was a valid trade and entry and i managed to get v goood pips from there....see the screenshot of my thread carefully and see the oneday back my vaild entry long....

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Yes. i see that. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thank you and I appreciate it. I will try to attach it to my MT4.

Hello everybody!!! I just got +67 pips today on Gbd/Jpy..+22 on real and +45 on demo Look at the 30 mints chart according to my system.... I didnt make any entry yet today on Euro/Usd coz no codition is met yet....

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Euro/Usd is still showing sideways candles so didnt enter yet!!! &amp; Conditions didnt also met properly Yet!!! No Trade Yet!!!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hey!!! I just close my trade on Euro/Usd.... I entered at 1.4475 &amp; Exit at 1.4493.... See the 30 Mints Chart according to my system conditions are clearly met ,,,, Macd,s lines have crossed and heading towards upside ssto have also did the smae ... Rsi is upward inthe combination of RSI/ATR loook at chart you,ll clearly see how....+20 pips are locked for today!!! Results came very slow but manage to Get +20 pips....

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Sorry Guys!!! Read My thread again i forget to right Detail About the combination Of RSI=7 &amp; ATR=20 Crossing ....Read it Carefully in entry Rulzzz!!!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Euro/Usd have moved +99 pips yet waoo from my entry...But i just close my position at +20 pips....

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I'm really sorry for this stupid question. I've downloaded the macd2 indi and I want to put it on my main chart, but it keep go into a new window! How can I avoid it? I use the MT4 with NF broker. Once again, I'm really sorry for this stupid question.. and the SSTO is use the stochastic oscillator, with default setting 5,3,3. is that correct?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I don't know of any way to put it on the main chart. I would rather have it in the new window. It has the histogram with it that makes it easier to see crosses. When the histogram crosses zero, it means the lines have crossed.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Oh Come on Guys didnt matter if ur charting package didnt have an option to put macd on Charts with candle....U Can put it in a new window ....Mian purpose of macd to put on chart with candle is just to c its crossing clearly....If ur charting package is providing u macd with clear crossing of two lines also with histrogram then its Ok

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Ya SSTO with srtting is 5, 3, 3 is correct...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi All I dont Know histrogram and its working... My system just requires just Macd(5,34,5) with histrogram with two lines coz we all have to focus the crossing of two lines not the histogram....I dont know Wht billbass is saying about histrogram...I mean i didnt understand that....

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Guys look at the excellent Result on !!! Usd/Chf according to my system.... i got +80 pips of total..... +14 on real and remaining on demo.... Coz im Just testing my system on different pairs.... TF= 30 MINTS....

--- 帖子 #82 ---
The MACD histogram crosses the zero line when the two lines cross. If you don't want the histogram you can remove it. I keep it there because I like it.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hey im simply just using Macd with two lines and histogram but i focus just two lines anyways bill if anybody here using mt4 and have not two lines only have histogram then brief him about histogram and its working according to the crossing of lines coz its an important indicator to use....

--- 帖子 #84 ---
The standard MT4 MACD is not good to use with this system. It has a histogram, but it is a histogram of the MACD itself. It also has a signal line with it, but it is very difficult to see a cross. The MACD2 file that I posted here actually has the two lines. The histogram that comes with it is different from the MT4 MACD histogram. If you don't want the histogram you can change the color to "none".

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Ya i have already chanded histograms colour to white on white chart coz no none color option in my chart... I think cms broker is also using mt4....their charts have macd with two signal lines and histogram....but we cannot put it on chart with candles to c clear view of crossing....Well See the image that i have posted in my thread...how clear macd,s crossing is showing with candles....and how clear the other indicators are showing the short signal....

--- 帖子 #86 ---
If other indicators, RSI, ATR, and MACD all signal for sell/buy, but the SSTO is outside 80/20 region, would you still make an entry?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Ya but just for few pips .... Listen.... If all indicators are giving me long signal but ssto is 65-75 then i,ll enter but just for few pips like 6/7 without spread and even if signals are very strong then 10/15 pips but normally it didnt happened much specially on Gbd/Jpy...But if this condition happened then avoide to enter in a dead market coz Specially Euro/Usd will not give u what u want... Loook at the screenshot of my thread ....Short signal is clearly seen...look at ssto is in almost in the mid and we enter and got planty of pips....But just consider if u enter whn all indicators are giving u suppose clear long signal but ssto is 65-75 then u may got few pips but after reaching 80 or 90 it will bounces back and maybe u can hit ur SL....Which is just -20 pips...Loook at screen shot and u can clearly see whn ever all signals are ok see ssto that how its working ....For more detail of ur answer see the histry with the help of my system on your chart....U,ll find more accurate answer of ur question.... GoodLuck

Guys Keep an eye on Usd/Chf and Gbd/Jpy also on Euro/Usd

--- 帖子 #90 ---
did you also use the 20pips SL in the GJ pair?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
My Todays Euro/Usd entry Detail!!! Today whn i enter for long on EURO/USD THEN 1)SSTO was crossed each and was at 52.88 and heading towards upside... 2)Rsi crossed ATR and heading toward upside....RSI was at 58.5 on my entry time for long.... 3)P-SAR dots were already there that why i plan to get few pips but +15 just but i judged with the condition that mkt will give me more so i close my position at +20.... 4)Macd signal lines just crossed and headed towards upside... 5) A valid entry was that badluck that i closed my position on just +20 but mkt moved upto +50

--- 帖子 #92 ---
i have did almost just 8/9 trades on GBD/JPY on real and hardly very few times they reached near to my SL but didnt hit yet....As i told all later tht im trading in EURO/USD from last 5/6 months with my system...and its giving me healthy results ...the only time i fail whn i mistakenly enter in a news time, a very crucial time...Anyways i introduced my system to all from last few days....Results of EURO/USD are infront of all... +45 pips in first day ( i LOCKED + 17) +50 today... ( I LOCKED +20) other pips are on Gbd/jpy &amp; about Gbd/jpy i use 20 pips SL ya its right coz my entry is almost very goood but man i think im unable to guide u about SL in a right way coz im using this pair from just last 8/9 trades In real and as well as on demo....and my experience is of just 8/9 trades....yet i Didnt hit SL and successful but My experience of SL on EURO/Usd is from last 5/6 months...

hi all?is that a signal i see on most of the jyp? well i will take the ej for now and see where it goes.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I wouldn't call it the same method. SAR with various filters has been around for 40 years. You see many systems based upon this. James used the MACD and he didn't originate that. I've seen other systems use SAR and MACD together. This system has added the stochastic and the RSI.

Guys!! Watchout euro/usd false signal coz rsi didnt cross atr downward or even rsi is not near to cross....meanwhile macd and sar is signaling short....watchout....

Look at screenshot clearly to avoide from false signals!!!

I,ll just give u advice that try to use this system on G/J instead of other jpy pairs coz i have a goood experience of tht system with G/J....Im not sure about other Jpy,s.....

You didn't have the RSI-ATR cross on the GBP/JPY short either, which you took.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
BillBass read my last post carefully!!! "Rsi must crossed atr or near to cross".... Now see the chart of gbd/jpy....i entered in a second red candle with 2nd sar dot whn rsi was very near to cross....SSto already crossed and trending downside....See the chart....

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Whn i short it was second red candle....with 2nd sar dot....coz rsi was on 46.somthing and atr was 39.somthing means both r near to cross... and y i didnt entered on 1-st sar dot coz both atr and rsi was not near on first red candle even mkt drops down i enter on 2nd sar dot just to avoide false signal....u c ur chart carefully u,ll find ur answer.... i always enter whn im confirm tht im safe from false signals....

--- 帖子 #108 ---
This is a time that i dont trade in EURO/USD coz i consider it a dead time for that pair....very few time i c volatality intht pair inthis time....so i,ll advice all to stay away from euro/usd ...even if it gives u short signal or not....just watch....i know that now mkt of euro/usd is moving downside but movement will be slow and news time is near....dont trapped urself for slow results....onthe other hand gbd/jpy is wellcome...

See the fig.... in a first red candle with sar dot above rsi was near and about to cross but was not very near so i didnt enter just to avoide from false signal &amp; loook at 2nd red candle with short signal rsi almost crossed atr and i enter and when the next new 3rd green candle appears blue line of rsi 7 was still in a region of atr line and remains down and i was waiting and manage to get +40 pips at the end...... So 2nd red candle was my entry candle .....Now wht u say about your chart...?

Your 1st, 2nd &amp; last signal seems to me right but only problem with your chart is RSI &amp; ATR crossing ....They are showing some gap as compare to my chart with same setting....c my last few posts in which i have posted screenshots of same g/u chart .... Ok u do one thing tomorrow post me same screenshot with setting of RSI=4 &amp; ART= 14 ....I,ll think gap might fill....Otherwise other indicators are okkkzz...See my posted screenshots....u,ll find more clarity....

Post same screenshot with setting as RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14....i want the gap to fill....Mt4 users chart showing different story....See my screenshots for more detail....

Hi, I think we are using different formulas for the Average True Range (ATR) calculation. See picture below. I'm indicating how ATR goes up after NFP bar - when it start to sum in the average - and goes down 20 bars later. Besides, it is smoother than the ATR showed in your pictures. MT4 calculates ATR(20) as: 20 SimpleMA of (Maximum(High,Close)-Minimum(Close,Low)) Do you know which formula does your platform use ?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
have you ever loss with this system? what about your p/l ratio within 5-6 last months?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
just got a signal on G/J pair. sell on 239.35. tp 238.95 (pivot point) sl 239.59.. let's see how this trade will go.. it's fast... hit my sl. but it goes to the right direction about +-35 pips, but go back and hit my sl. luckily it's a demo... the time on fxcm is 10.30 (sgt+8.00)

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hey, look at this... Middle window is RSI 7 in combination with ATR 20, exactly as it appears on pictures posted as correct ones. Bottom window is ATR 20 as it appears on MT4 platform. It looks like ATR20 on middle window is ATR of RSI, not ATR of price like bottom one. MT4 only supports ATR on price. It's anybody there that can help us with an indicator for MT4?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
U should have to close ur position at +30 pips coz see my previous posts i have in which mentioned that how to change SL time to time.... i think go back and see page no one.....Can u show me screenshot of your that trade coz i have already posted the screenshots of my succesful trade on g/j tomorrow....

--- 帖子 #129 ---
If you r using MT4 charts then sorry im not sure about ur entry point....see screen shots of my same g/j entry ....+40 pips i get with same -20 pips sl....

--- 帖子 #130 ---
my broker is NF, but I see the fxcm chart to confirm the ATR poin (since the value of ATR is different between mt4 and fxcm's). yes, I should change the SL when the price go +30pips, but It was too fast, so the order can't go through the server, there comes the loss.. hiks... I think I should use the TS 25 pips, or fix profit at 40 pips for gj, because the fast movement.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Thanks for your advice on the jyp.Btw i was trading the ejy yesterday.i also think the atr14 and rsi 4 show the cross better. is that a singal on the gjy right now?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
That is the problem with MT4 users i think!!! U got the point man.... I think their mt4 charting package didnt support rsi with atr....thats why still showing gap....

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Sure man +40 pips again but dont enter now ur late now u have to enter inthe appearance of 1st sar dot coz other conditions already met....see the charts....Unluckly im late to to enter and missed the clean and clear pips....Dammmmmm

--- 帖子 #134 ---
he, he am already in and at +24 atm.the 2 atr in my chart are the same.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
GooodLuck &amp; Happy Pips!!! Hey Its Seems that Combination of RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14 works great for MT4 users loook at ur chart it seems almost same like mine ....im going to post the screenshot of mine....wait

--- 帖子 #136 ---
RSI and ATR are based upon different scales. RSI ranges between 0 and 100- large numbers. ATR is numbers like .0023 or 1.07. If you put them in the same window and report them accurately, the ATR would look like a straight horizontal line, near 0, and the RSI would be huge compared to it. In reality every time RSI crosses the zero line, it's crossing the ATR. Charting software magnifies the ATR when you put it in the same window with RSI to make the two indicators look similar in magnitude. Different software makers can use different multipliers on the ATR and it will look differently in relation to the RSI. If yours are crossing and some other chart shows them not crossing, it's pure accident and is meaningless. Neither is right and neither is wrong. Both charts distort the ATR in different ways.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Just took my 30 pips on that one . gota go to work now.good luck all and happy green pips

Guys!!! Loook at the SCREENSHOT of my chart....Clear short signal....i have to enter for short whn first sar dot appears and see below rsi already crosses atr and heading downside....ssto is also did the same thing already....Masd also crosses its two lines and going down....But DAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM unluckly i miss the apportunity and whn i see my chart it was the 3rd red candle with 3rd sar dot on above....I didnt enter why...? coz ssto was alredy in downside and i know tht mkt can anytime bounces back....so im justing waiting and watching that how i miss the clear chance.... On the other hand see the same fig. with arrow back....Macd already crosses, first sar dot appears and rsi was very near to cross. but if incase i enter i that trade then i have to exit on almost breakevent coz appposite sar dot was there....but soon if was there then i enter again coz coditions were strongly appears in my favour whn again sar dot appears above ....Anyways see the screeshot that how i missed....the clean chance of entrance....Here u can see that how ssto works coz it saves me to enter in a oversold condition....Although mkt is breash but u see i dont take stupid entries or chances....

Bill!!! Try to use RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14and post the same screenshot here of G/J which i have just post....coz see a post of ERICO ...see his screeshot oF RSI &amp; ATR with setting 4=14 respectively...his mt4 chart shows almost same like me....Check it and tell me if it works on ur mt4 then my be i advice mt4 user only to set rsi and atr with these settings....

--- 帖子 #141 ---
OK- Here it is.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Bill!!! it seems tht this new setting is excatly working for mt4 users....see now how your chart seems same like mine....see the screenshots which i have posted back....anyways i was write according to my charts...but mt4 charts shows different stories....i think i have to advise mt4 user to change the rsi=4 and atr=14 new setting ....and other user use them with old setting as 7=20 ...? wht u say ur a senior member...? as i said manytimes tht i have no experience of mt4 and i never use them....

--- 帖子 #143 ---
It looks much closer to yours. I'll have to watch it for awhile to see if it helps on entries.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
dear umairs, I wait for the E/U signal now.. what do you think? the macd has been crossing, the stoch also crossing, wait until the p-sar change its direction and it's a short entry?? btw. the RSI 4 and ATR 14 on mt4 gives me different chart with the fxcm 's RSI 7 and ATR 20.. so for me it's better to look the fxcm chart when the price is near to the signal to see a better perspective..

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hey look at G/J +70 PIPS from right ...unluckly i missed the chance to enter i was late ...see the screenshots i have posted back...Gunshot try to set ur chart like!!! MACD = 5 , 34 , 5 RSI=4 &amp; ATR= 14 SSTO= 5 , 3 , 3 SAR = DEFAULT then compare it with my screenshot of of G/J....compare ur entry point with mine &amp; see the results ...ur mt4 must be looking same like mine.... and about sl man....i have already mentiond manytime tht im also new on this pair like u....i dont have much experience to trade on this pair although i never hit the sl ever coz my entries are very goood and according to my rulzz...ya g/j is a volitile pair i think sl must be -30 pips ontht pair....im researching on tht pair....still its giving me 100% results....and i also didnt enter in a trade in which u hit sl but u was +35 before to hit....if i was there i close my position....coz i dont know wht was the condition of ur chart as mt4 charts are showing d/f stories.... I think no chace to enter in euro/usd inthe first session....but keep ur eye on it....on second session it will drop....it is already on hight....four hour chart look there....sssto is in overbought....keep ur eye on it....

--- 帖子 #146 ---
macd crossed , rsi is already down, ssto is down but sar still to appear....wait for sar....dont enter if ssto is already in oversold....

thanks for sharing your system,can u post the template pls?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
hi, just have a quick question. Do you make an entry as soon as you see a p-sar dot? or you wait the 30 minute bar to finish then make an entry. Thank you for sharing your system.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I've uploaded the template in a few page earlier. please check it.. hope it helps..

--- 帖子 #150 ---
lOOK at my thread with new screenshots....u,ll i hope find ur answer....No i never enter onthe appearance of first sar dot until i confirm other indicators to enter specially ssto....it must not be in a overbought region already for long and vice-vers for short....Read my thread agin and again carefully....

--- 帖子 #151 ---
As i mentioned tht no chance for short in a first session in that pair and it happened ....Still bullish,,,, No entry signal yet.... Im still disappointed tht i miss the clean entry on G/J....DAMMMM.... +80 i think....Still no pips from the start of day!!!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Ya many times when i becomzz greedy on E/U but i think 85-90 % is a winning rate but loosing rate is sure if u enter accediently in a news time or in a dead mkt....i mean i a closing session....go back and see the results i have posted in a couple of days back....

dear sir, I've just sell G/J at 238.09, sl 20, tp 30 pips.. do you think it's a valid entry?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Ya ur entry was right but see G/J already moved down to more thn 100 pips dont drawn more with it....if u enter thn close ur trade even if u got +20 or little less....i think u entered at 238.09 nd G/J moves back to 237.89...almost +20 pips but ....valid entry was at the morning whn G/J droped down for almost 200 pips....

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Dont drawn more coz almost 200 pips down G/J....wait for uptrend and reversal entry with the help of my systems ...Now i hope G/J will make its movement on upside....Valid entry was on morning whn my system genetrates short signal and G/J move down u see the posted images ....of taday i think in previous page....

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I think we have to change our SL strategy for G/J i think -20 to -30 pips....im working on it....Just practice my system on demo for almost a month if ur intrested ...learn how to enter and exit from screenshots which i have posted in my thread....nd in my posts...Coz once u,ll learn pips pips and just pips will be ur,s specially on G/J....

If you're using MT4, be sure you refresh the chart occasionally. If you don't, the SAR will get stuck and not move. The easy way to refresh it is to switch to another time frame then back. Everyone may already know this.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
FxHaz If all other rulzz met &amp; P-SAR DOT already there but RSI/ATR not yet crossed then i wait them atleast to be near to cross....whn they r very near to cross then i enter....for more see screenshorts but watchout for ssto it must not be already at oversold for short and vice-versa for long....

--- 帖子 #168 ---

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thanks Umairs, looking at your chart my sars are the same as yours, but they didn't move to the top of the candle until an hour after the news. I took the trade and got out with 9 pips. Do you think the gbp/jpy is setting up for a sell? Thanks to you and everyone else for your help. Dan

--- 帖子 #174 ---
No dann See the G/J according to my system but this time with four hours time period....look at ssto it almost crossed and heading towars upside after a long bearish now finally going back....Now move back to 30 mints tf....its near to give sell signal....but watchout ssto its almost in oversold region....but if all conditions are met then u may enter but just for few pips....but im sure G/J on 30 mints will not give sell signal ....even if it gives thn it will not be a strong enough to enter,,,,batter stayy away or try on demo.....

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Yes I make you right RSI is also showing oversold in 4h, best left alone. thanks Dan

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi all, Attached is a modified ATR on RSI indicator for MT4, just enter ATR Period and RSI Period... its default, obviously, ATR 20 =&gt; RSI 7. U have to drag it to a window with RSI 7 already, because it only paints the ATR line &amp; you should remove the fixed minimum &amp; maximum for RSI indicator in the "Parameters" Tab. See screenshot... it is now as Umairs pictures... Regards..

--- 帖子 #177 ---
G/J on a record low....My System clearly giving short signal but i didnt enter coz i thought almost more than 200 pips down already also look at 4-Hour chart with my system...ssto is also already in a oversold region and was heading back ....But G/J is in record bearish today....I made a sell entry on demo and manage to lock +40 but didnt try on real coz i was not sure tht G/J droppes again with that pips....But it seems that my system is really successful on G/J....total i did 14 trades on G/J including demo &amp; all are +ve yet....But here i must say dont be greedy for pips just greedy for healthy strong performance....

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I think beginners are just like a young kid who is just learning how to walk ....He may slipped here and there , try to walk slowly and steadly but after some time he started to walk perfectly!!! Beginners in a forex is same like young little kid.... I just wana give u small advise....Just try to get +10 pips per day and do it almost for 2-months on demo, not at once on real.... Dont be greedy to get more and more pips....Coz nobody can never go to the last step of any stair....One by one u can reach at last....Once u successfully get expert and habitual about getting pips....then u,ll get confidence that atleast u can get 10-pips per day....Just think getting ten pips successfuly per day means at the end of 22-trading days u can get 220 pips....which are enough for beginners....Look at signal provider companies and their performances....Average pips per month are 250/300 ....or even 400/500....But first make urself expert in getting 220 pips per month. If ur successfull in getting 220 pips per month then im 100% sure u,ll definetly get more pips then any signal provider company after sometime...try ur stratigies on demo...check urself that can u survive in forex or not....? Coz forex is a game that one wrong entry will taste u hell....When i start forex no one was there to advise me, No one was there to give me knowledge, no one was there to guide me, Even nobody knows in my family that what is forex....? lolzzzz....I was accidently came into that field....I tried hard to learn , learn and just learn....I have researched alot on forex and now im successfuly able to develop a system for me ....Although im doing a very good job...i have no need to do that business....But know i think forex becomes my passion....I just wana give beginners a sincere advise that dont rely on signal providers and forex systems including my own....Just try to do what u think is +ve for u....EVen still if u follow my system then first practice on demo for excat entries and exit for atleast two months then on 3rd month make a new demo account and consider it as ur real account for entries, exit &amp; SL and see ur performance....U,ll after a month find urself that what ur in a forex....Remember never feel urself overconfidence without any proper practice &amp; experience....Never greedy for pips always greedy for healthy strong performance.... Go to www.babypips.com For forex education ....i think that is the best ever site in a earth about forex education....

Can anyone share your Template and Indicators so I just plug it inmy MT4. Thanks...I am still learning here.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi myonlyzzz, If you go to the top of the page, there is a button to the right of the page numbers, at the moment it has 24 on it. Click on that and you will find Umairs template and all the other indicators that have been uploaded. Dan

--- 帖子 #181 ---
dear folks, Are you waiting for the G/J signal now? I think I just wait for the psar signal to make it valid entry, all other condition has been fullfilled.. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Gunshot look at the screenshot tht how i entered and how i exit....+30 pips i managed to get but overall G/J moved upto +79 pips but i closed my position coz of almost overbought SSTO....

--- 帖子 #183 ---
sorry for this Question. how much is the value of overboughted/oversold SSTO?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I think 68. something thts y i just close my position at +30 pips

--- 帖子 #185 ---
All signals was perfectly met but look at news of JPY '' ''Machine Tool Orders y/y'' its again change the whole situation....although news was not much important but it dropped G/J down more to 50 pips....i didnt enter i was just watching coz i know news will kill my system and it did....coz all conditions are met but news .....

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I just enter for short and get quick +25 pips....Short signal on G/J

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Lolzzz thank god i exit coz again new time announcement '' Eco Watchers Survey'' of JPY I really hate these sort of stupidities from me.....

--- 帖子 #188 ---
These are the conditions that i really hate....i almost always fail whenever i mistakenly or accediently entered in a news time....dont know how i missed to monitor news of JPY=Eco Watchers Survey... That why i really hate news timing &amp; annoucements coz Although i manage to get +25 pips but that was a gamble....Just try to avoide from news timing coz G/J gives first long signal whn news on JPY=Machine Tool Orders y/y ANNOUNCE.... i didnt enter here. Coz news immediatly failed my system... But thn another announcement on JPY=Eco Watchers Survey announced ....i mistakenly entered here &amp; get quick pips but dont know how i forget to keep an eye on 2nd news announcement of Jpy. See G/J pullls back ....Thts y i always force all to stay away be4 &amp; after half hour of news.....

--- 帖子 #189 ---
See G/J Screenshsot in my last post with screenshot....where i successfully entered and managed to get +30 clean pips without any news news....All conditions are successfully met and see the fig....

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Just took 22 pips from eur/usd. It might go further, but the indicators were saying overbought and hit 50% fib of recent HI LO. Good start to the day. Dan

--- 帖子 #191 ---
here is 3 successfull trade.. btw, i have problem with rsi-atr, neither 4-14 setting nor indi ATRonRSI posted before is match with yours.. so, i stick with your 7-20 setting as long as it doesn't bring us to losses.. you/we may modify the original system to be more universal, so MT4 or others platform user have no problem with it

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Gooodluck Dan it really was a long signal i entered at 1.4649 and closed at 1.4668= +19 on E/U.....See the chart of E/U according to my System....

--- 帖子 #193 ---
iT seems ur understanding my system....

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Herry!!! Ur setting seems to me ok ....Successful results r infront of u....

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Yes I went long, in at 1.4647 and out at 69. I came out because rsi was showing overbought and stochs were moving into overbought it also hit 50% fib which it is still testing now. I think it will break that level and carry on long, but where there is doubt I like to take my money off the table. From what I have seen so far this is a great system Umairs if you stick to the rules and I also keep a ff calender in front of me and set alarm clock for 30 mins before any major news. Finished live trading for the day now, demo for the rest of the day. Thanks Umairs Dan

--- 帖子 #196 ---
See screenshot

--- 帖子 #197 ---

--- 帖子 #198 ---

--- 帖子 #199 ---
No I don't think you can Umairs, I just check the calender before I start trading then set my alarm clock to go of 30 mins before the announcement. Talking of which UK interest rates are being announced at 12:00 gmt (35 mins from now. Dan

--- 帖子 #216 ---
having some little problem uploading but hope it will work this time

--- 帖子 #217 ---
pardon? so far i have no bad signal in eu using 7-20 setting, also i've compared my 4-14 chart with your 7-20 (on your platform) and it seems different.. then i have no idea why i have to change it.. let me know if i disturb your thread cos i'm using different setting, i'll stop it.. here's chart for comparison.. compare with ericoco's one..

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Nice one ericoco, I missed that one. UK Trade Balance coming up at 9:30 gmt. Hasn't moved the market much in recent months, but with a good deviation we could see a 20/30 pip spike. We also have USD and CAD Trade Balance at 13:30 gmt which could have a similar affect. The last one to avoid is the US Consumer at 15:00 gmt.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Ericoo was right ,,, See the screenshot.....i was not there coz i was busy in a important meeting....if i was there then i must target clean +50 pips on USD/CHF....

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Ericoo was right ,,, See the screenshot.....i was not there coz i was busy in a important meeting....if i was there then i must target clean +50 pips on USD/CHF....That all happened after the +chf data ...i may enter for long after the half hour but unluckly was not there....as i said im a much busy person....

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I need a person to alert me if all condition met according to my system with no news time on other curriencies....coz i normally keep an eye on E/U &amp; G/J....can anybody do tht for me and for other form readers ,,,, &amp; i also want viewers to rate my system....u like it or not....but +pipssss nd results are infront of all....Gooodluck

Trading in forex is a extreme dangerous thing....Specially for beginners....Read my sincere advise again nd again....I dont have much experience of my system with other pairs and with other tf...G/J &amp; E/U are the only pair i recommend u all....but if u still use my system then use it on ur demo first with other pairs and other TF,s....see my most of trades , winning trades in E/U &amp; G/J....Main purpose of using TF=30 mints is the SL. &amp; my healthy results. As my System is based on my hard rsearch &amp; 30 mints TF is best for my system..if u use my system with hight TF...then change the SL strategy......im not much sure about it....but i think !!! 30 Mints TF==== SL = -20 on E/U &amp; -25 On G/J(Depends on ur entry for G/J) 1-Houre TF==== SL = -30 On E/U &amp; -40 on G/J 4-Hours TF==== SL = -40 On E/U &amp; -60 on G/J I again wana say that im not much sure about it ....these TF instead of 30-Mints TF Based on my very little research....

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I consider trading on news is the most dangerous style of trading....Specially for beginners....Ur brokers becomes stophunts, Positions cannot closed on time, Hight retracement etc, etc and etc....thats all happened whenever an important news announce.... I just consider it a gamble....I saw lot of pplzz losing while trading on news....Its actually not the brokers fault...Its Just the impact of news...Try to avoide that trading style...

Be4 exiting i was with +12 pips profit coz E/U seems to me bit slow but unluckly whn i exit E/U Dropps more then my expectation....coz i was expecting to dropp E/U more in my entry candle...but when i exit it starting to dropp down fast as i was expecting in my entry candle.... i entered at 77 &amp; exit at 63....but it dropped down to +46 pips if i hold my position before retracing back....anyways goood trade was that too....coz my decision to close my position early was batter....coz it seems to me very slow and i normally avoide to enter in a dead market specailly E/U....i told u all to that you may all enter after the half hour of news if all conditions met according to my system. see my previous posts bef news...and it happened and i managed to get +12 pips...

Looks Good Umairs, looking forward to seeing the system, but no rush, do your testing first. I'm with fxcm too so we are on the same spreads , but with the live account I find there is often an extra pip or so when it hits the open window and it always seems to be against you, so please allow for slippage in your testing. thanks Dan

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Dont worry Dan....My Scalping system offers best results so far ....I think its working great with G/U, E/J , N/U &amp; G/J......I,ll post screen shots with excat entry &amp; exit ....if u concentrate a singal pair in day like E/J then you make get lot of pips with the help of scalping.....well basically im not a scalper but coz of +ve results its really sounds intresting to me...

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I already in a morning got +50 pips today so thats why i was bit lazy today...see the another excellent G/J trade apportunity with results...Goodluck

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi Umair, can you put list of indicators and their settings here again? (For MT4). Because i think your settings for indicators are changed! BTW your sclaping system is great!

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi Umair! Could you please post a link to download the ATRonRSI Indicator for Metatrader. I could not find it anywhere. Best Regards walb99

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi walb99: In post #176 on page 12 u can find the indicator ATRonRSI. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=54614&amp;page=12 Good luck

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi2... See the first page of my threat again! if you are MT4 user then below is the setting for you!!! Indicators Which I Normally Use!!! P-SAR = Default. (On Candlestick Chart Only) MACD = 5, 34 , 5 ( On Candlestick Chart Or Default Style...which gives You clear view of its two lines crossing).... SSTO(Stochastic Slow) = 5 , 3 , 3 MT4 Users only!!! Set Combination of RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14 Time Frame= 30 Minutes Only. Burhan thats all about my setting but incase if you are MT4 User then Set RSI=4 &amp; ATR = 14 because in this case your chart will seem almost like my chart...for further confirmation post the screenshort of your MT4 Chart according to my system and settings...i,ll confirm it that its right or wrong... See the page No. 8,9,10 of my thread ....Some one have posted me screenshot with same problem like you have &amp; i have confirmed its settings... GoodLuck!!!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hello !!! See the following page no &amp; post no of my thread you will find your required indicators overthere.... Page No # 12 Post No # 176 Best Regards!!! Umair

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hello Venca, What settings you are using of my system About RSI &amp; ATR...? They are working for you are not on your MT4...?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I tried this one already, but it plots the ATR into a different window, the comment says it should be dragged onto the RSI indicator, but I do not know how to do this. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Walb !!! Any Mt4 user can helps u i guess...Coz i almost never use MT4 Before... Coz Putting ATR With RSI is the most important thing....See my previous posts with screenshots &amp; Results .... GoodLuck

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Umair this is screen shot of my platform. But i think there is something missing. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi walb99, at the top of your mt4 screen click on view, navigator, then click on Custom Indicators, left click ATR hold it down and drag it to your RSI window. Dan

--- 帖子 #259 ---
How to plot indicators in the same window: simply point the indicator in Navigator (left side of screen) then click and hold left button of mouse then drag it all the way into the window of another indicator under the chart and drop it. You should have 2 indicators in the same window now. Umairs2004: is this chart correct ? My template: umairs30tf_mt4.tpl in D:\Program Files\X-Trader 4 XTB\templates

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Finally I managed this dragging riddle. Thank you. I made screenshots of both charts to compare the different settings, one is the chart from powercharts with the original settings the other one is the MT chart (without MACD). I think it's clear, that they are not equal. Best regards Walb99

--- 帖子 #261 ---
here is the second one...

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Yar where is MACD(5,34,5)...? Its missing...also u didnt combine RSI With ATR....? first set RSI=7 &amp; ATR= 20 then inthe smae window with RSI ....why dont u see screenshots which i have posted...coz if u put rsi and atr alone in two different windows then you,ll find something different story.... Rmember all conditions mut met....to enter in a trade coz rulzz are rulzz...see my past post with screenshots...how i enter according to all condition if they met....so far im very successful...see results of my system...your other indicators are alright...try to set your chart according to my system &amp; post me screenshot....again Goodluck burhan...

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hey Venca so far your chart seems to me alright but better can you post me screenshot again with rsi=7 &amp; atr=20 coz rsi=4 &amp; atr= 14 seems little fast in your chart....i,ll confirm your setting after comparing both....but meanwhile here ur chart seems to me accurate ....im pointing entry candles in your chart ...as ur entry is same almost like my entry...See ur own chart screenshot ....

Walb!!! thank god that your problem is solved.... Can u post ur MT4 screen shot with setting of RSI=7 &amp; ATR=20 Also with other settings too.... I,ll confirm it ....coz it seems RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14 seems little fast ... But if u use fxcm powerchart then Put rsi=7 in atr=20 ...

--- 帖子 #265 ---
See E/U... After that no signal yet on E/U....

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I normally avoide to enter in a situation like that....See the screenshot for more....

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Thanks man.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Venca I think RSI=4 &amp; ATR=14 suits u batter....coz this setting is almost same like mine...as compared to rsi=7 &amp; atr=20... did u enter for long in E/U....set your chart according to my system with rsi=4 and atr=14 ....see the 3rd candle from your right of ur chart....i enter and exit inthe same candle for 11-pips coz ssto was near to cross at overbought region.... well so far i analyze that rsi=4 and atr = 14 is the best settings for mt4 users... gooodluck

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hope now everything is OK, would you please look, whether the charts are really the same. I used the ATRonRSI now instead of the standad ATR. This one is much better. Best regards Walb99

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) S ee this how u may enter ...in ur mt4 chart...but concentrate more on ssto before ur entry &amp; exit....

--- 帖子 #271 ---
see screenshot...

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Great shot walb....it seems u have perfectly solved problems for mt4 users....let me examine it more...i,ll respond u again sooon...great man

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Can u post more screenshots in a same comparizon style on G/J also...? i wana do some little research on it...it seems by first putting ATR=20 and then RSI=7 is working for mt4 users....

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Here it is!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
This is the comparison of G/J

--- 帖子 #276 ---
sorry the last one was crap, I will try again..

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Walb! wht setting u have used in ur post no 269...in E/U....coz ur setting on E/U sound great but here its not seems to me working well on G/J.... anyways im unable to open ur last screenshot of E/U...i can just see the posted screenshot..thts why im asking about its settings of ur last E/U screenshot...? did u use ATR =20 First &amp; then u put RSI = 7 in it in ur E/U settings...? Or did u use RSI=7 First &amp; then Put ATR= 20 in it in ur E/U Settings...? Then u have compared it with fxcm,s power chart and it seems same like mine...in E/U ur 2nd last post...

--- 帖子 #278 ---
this is the right one, please look at this again.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
No walb!!! Never use ATR=20 first and then rsi=7 in fxcm,s chart coz it will change the whole condition with situation.... im not sure about mt4 charts.... but better i suggest all mt4 users to use RSI=4 &amp; THEN put ATR=14 in it.... coz i have examined the results and situations are almost same like my charts....

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Umair, I put the RSI (7) first then dragged the ATRonRSI (20) on it.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Your post no 269 and page no 18 post about E/U screenshot is same like my chart...see it by urself.... But see venca,s chart in which i have pointed the entry candles ...he is also mt4.... i have posted lot of screenshorts of my chart with trades on daily basis...and the puropse is just to compare ur charts with my chart...even whatever charting packages ur using.... If rsi=7 &amp; atr= 20 suits u then best is that if rsi=4 &amp; atr=14 suits u then even also best dosn't matter... just compare ur charts with my chart and analysis which is batter setting for u.... coz other chart users may fit rsi=7 &amp; atr=20 best but mt4 may suits rsi=4 &amp; atr=14 best...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi Umair, in this version of G/J comp the settings for SSTO are corrected. Have a good day walb99

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Clear G/J Short signal as it pulls back also but enter important news is coming....

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Your settings on your mt4 seems perfect according to my G/J Chart....but see the fxcm ,s chart it wrong settings of rsi &amp; atr it seems tht u first set atr=20 &amp; then put rsi=7 in it....but u have to set as rsi=7 &amp; atr=20 in it according to my system rulzz and requirments....onthe other hand ur setting on G/J on ur mt4 chart looks same like my chart whatever setting u have set there in ur mt4 chart...

--- 帖子 #285 ---
See the screenshot

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi Umair, i have tried but don't know how to combine RSI and ATR in MT4.. Can you please use your MT4 and plot your indicators and settings, and give us final MT4 template file?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Now I put the RSI first on powercharts and also on MT-charts, the MT-chart displays a comparison of RSI 7 + ATR 20 and RSI 4 + ATR 14

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Page No#18 Post No#259 of my thread Go there and learn it... Yar i almost never use MT4 Before in my trading life...I dont know much about it....read the other posts of my thread...maybe somebody using mt4 may helps you...im using Fxcm, Oanda &amp; Xtick charts

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi burhan! you wrote: i have tried but don't know how to combine RSI and ATR in MT4..Can you please use your MT4 and plot your indicators and settings, these are all standard indicators with th settings discribed on the fisrt page of this thread. the only trick is to get the dragging thing with the ATRonRSI fixed, which is also discribed in a recent post. Hope this helps walb99

--- 帖子 #290 ---
??? correct ???

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Blue line is of rsi....? which is above...? I have also entered in a 2nd candle with 2nd long signal for +30 pips already,,,,see ssto and rsi they are going to overbought...if u enter like me in a second candle with 2nd long sar dot then see how u gettin pips...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
See macd it crossed in a first candle then meanwhile sar dot appears...i was also about to enter in a first candle when macd was almost near to crossed but before i enter G/J pulls back strongly then i expected...i just wait and let the macd crossed then i entered in a second candle with 2nd sar long dot

--- 帖子 #293 ---
RSI is blue, ATR is red. All blue lines must be above the red lines for long. Or vice versa: all blue lines must be bellow the red lines for short.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Good that u got some pips... Know u may know how all conditions met to enter for a valid trade,,, just practice hard...i,ll soon post more easy scalping method...gooodluck

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Thank you. Good luck to you too. I will use SL=20pips for EUR/USD and SL=30pips for GBP/JPY. When condition met I will wait for some retracement on 5min chart. It should work.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Listen... If all condition for example met for long and the candle u want to enter is already move upto 15/20 pips then dont enter in a same candle until it pulls back or even if it didnt then enter in a next candle...u,ll sureshot get some quick pips in a next candle....coz G/J got great volatality and there is chance of hitting SL if u entered in candle for long if already the candle u wana enter moves upto 15/20 pips...but if u still enter then u have to change ur SL strategy for G/U AND about E/U its ok ....

--- 帖子 #297 ---

I will stay away.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi Umair! One qustion about ATR on RSI indicator is irritating me. If the price is advancing down, we should see with higher volatility ATR going up and RSI going down, so there will happen to be a crossover. In contrary, if th price is advancing up, the ATR and the RSI are both going up and there will not be a crossover neccessarily. Maybe this is a very silly qauestion, can you clearify it a bit. Best regards walb99

--- 帖子 #306 ---
No Vince!!! See rsi is below atr see ssto is almost in a overbought...Batter stay away

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Listen Vince!!! Forex is a deadly game...No system in a world is perfect...Even Im a professional trader ...But still i got a loosing trade today...But i think after last 20-trades i lose the first one...my success rate is very goood if i,ll show u my balance sheet at the end of month u,ll amazed lolzzz.....But never disappoint ....i recommend all the beginners to practice my system if they like it....for almost 2/3 months then in the 3/4th month make a new demo and consider it as ur real and then see urself. see my previous trades for more detail...you ,ll see that what ur in a forex...u can survive or not u,ll find urself with ur position in a forex...But never compare urself with me...im a professional inthat field with more than five years of my past experience...i have learned alot from my mistakes....My success rate is so goood that this loosing trade is nothing infront of me... +11+30-20=+21 see my todays result still +21.... But ur a beginner maybe with a small account...but using any system at once on real without any experience is a stupidity...still u need lot of experience ...No trading system in a world is 100% perfect...even my favourate cawbanga system in babypips got lot of loosing trades with ofcourse winning also...i really like that system but still lossing trades are there also....with goood success rate...&amp; about my successrate see my all posts with my winning trades and screenshots...that is my first loosing one. in my last twenty trades..i just recommend u to try hard on demo....Now im working on my scalping system...i,ll in which introduce two styles of trading...1) scalping 2) normal but targeting few pips...see my todays result but on demo....as im almost very much sure about its +ve results but im still using it on demo...

--- 帖子 #308 ---
See ur chart and compare same with mine no trade ....see how...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Umairs, When are you going to publish your scalping system? Thanks

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Soon Bill maybe next week but i still need little work to do on it....I want this system userfriendly specially for Mt4 users....I dont want any charting problem in it for any user...I hope my scalping system will be easy to use... Like i said that im not a scalper but it really sounds intresting to trade for few pips with 3/4 lots...

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Walb!!! Ur still using ATR in RSI ...? First tell me...Or RSI in ATR...?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I followed you advice and put RSI first.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
It is strange but it seems that MT4 is lying about crosses ATR and RSI. If I use zoom +1 I see the same cross as on Umairs chart. If I use no zoom which is standart setting MT4 I see a few more crosses. Compare the charts bellow. The red vertical line is on the same candle. First picture is with no zoom and second one is with zoom +1. Strange. Which means for me: USE ZOOM +1 TO LOOK IT AS UMAIRS CHARTS.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Remember Rsi moves with price...if price moves up rsi will also moves up and vice-versa...if we use rsi first and put atr in it...u,ll see if price moves up then rsi also moves up and atr goes down and vice versa...according to my point of view i use rsi and atr combination for trend...if rsi crossed atr upward then trend is up and vice-versa....By this combination i confirm the trend then other indicators like ssto helps me for avoiding overbought and oversold region...sar use for more confirmation for long and short...then macd crossing i use also for trend....and by combining all we have a Umairs System Lolzzz Maybe my theory abt. Rsi and atr combination might be wrong but its wroking very good for me...

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hey u got the point vince...That why i dont use MT4 lolzzz....Zooming mt4 chart describes us another story...

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Me Sighning off for a while~!!!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi Umair, as I understood before ATR is a masure for volatility of price, but I think this is wrong and the ATR on the RSI is a masure of the volatility of RSI? You said, it makes a big difference what you put first. If this really makes a differnce than the ATR as a second indicator masures the volatility of RSI, I guess. Best regards walb99

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I agree. I don't understand how using a cross of RSI and ATR accomplishes anything. Rising ATR indicates lengthening candles. That would have the same effect on a short as it would a long trade, whatever that effect may be, it would apply equally to buys and sells. The RSI- ATR crosses you see on your chart are a fiction. If accurately displayed, ATR would be a straight horizontal line, almost at the zero line. RSI crosses ATR everytime it crosses zero.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Would you go long Umairs ??? It seems to be a correct set up to me.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi billbss! In the picture you see that ATR of the price has a different movement than the ATR of the RSI...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Se e how important it is RSI Working with ATR....See the screenshot clearfully...See i also didnt use ssto so my charting window is showing wide gap of RSI &amp; ATR Crossing just like MT4 Users...

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Venca &amp; Walb!!! FF Have some problems while posing screenshots...both of ur,s screenshots is missing....Again post it....

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I found out that reloading the page helps to display the pictures Umair I have a question. After quite a long time trading this system would you say that it is a good sign when the SAR dots come later after the other indicator are in line. I am asking this because after only a few sessions I had the impression that in situations when the SAR dots were there first, but the others didn t connfirm, the dots were taken out again by price. What is your expirience? walb99

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Mt4 user dont be confused that your charts are not looking same like my charts specially RSI &amp; ATR ....see screenshot that how...? I have dragged ssto window that down that we cannot see it now see RSI &amp; ATR...looking same with gap like MT4 charts.... Another Example!!! Also see screenshot of!!! Post No # 313 Page No# 21 Almost same kind of thing with screenshort....

--- 帖子 #325 ---
interesting that on MT the first dot apears now on cable but not yet on powercharts...

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I think every one here may understand the importance of working of RSI &amp; ATR together that how together both works to confirm a trend...This is my thinking and threoy &amp; see the screen how its working to find a trend for me...Anyways i might be wrong but i have no care coz its working for me...Also Mt4 users may understand that zooming and dragging is the main problem.....I might not be available for most of the day tommorw coz im much busy tomorrow...I,ll catch you all maybe in a second session &amp; Remember im again saying that never use any of system at once on real...1st chose any system u feel impressive then forget about other system &amp; just try to be habitual of taking profit from ur chossen system on demo then come on real Thats my promise that u,ll get ur +reward but Just thorugh practice....Goood Luck Traders!!!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hahahaa walb!!! Set P-SAR dots to 0.1, 0.11 instead of default setting...you may find sar dot appearing most of the time with other indicators to enter a trade...but main purpose is just to avoide from false signals....from my experience i think default setting is best ...getting pure signals are batter then fake...maybe u maygot +ve results even much +ve results then me but lot of chances may accour for false signals...see my all trades with screenshots almost no false signal yet only today on E/U...even that was also the write coz i have to enter in a first candle but i was late even first candle with short sar dropps down for almost +15/20 pips if i may enter then that might be the winning trade for me but i was unlucky...anyways batter to follow default sar...otherwise not specail problem with new settings...

--- 帖子 #328 ---
that s what I thought allready... by the way, I found out that your ATRonRSI method is also know as quantitative-qualitative estimation (QQE). With the internal setting of ATR 20 and RSI 7. If you put the smoothing factor to 1 the RSI line looks pretty much the same like your indicator. Only the ATR line is little different. Look at the sreenshot please. Good night.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I was not in an action i was out and just saw the apportunity to enter for +trade see the screenshot...im again sighning off coz im very busy today maybe do any trade at 2nd session....

No valid looking entry in G/J See ssto...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Are these correct entries ?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
No Problem with ur chart venca its seems to me very accurate....see that was the clear long signal...we may enter in any of candles which i have pointed in a screenshot with black circle....but we may enter only for few pips...and that happened ...if i was there i just target +15 pips Just coz of SSTO....see now how E/U bounces back coz of ssto...after moving almost +25 pips....

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I didnt enter yet in G/J It seems to be a side ways ...so watchout coz its confusing me!!! Thart news make it confusing for me,.... ''Machine Tool Orders y/y''

--- 帖子 #338 ---

S o far news dominates...I did just a singal +ve trade yet with some successful (scalping) but on (demo)...Me leaving and will do no trade for today now...i think just single one is enough just bcz of news...

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi Umair ! First of all thanks for introducing your system ;-) I'm trying it on demo because I had a big draw down some time ago and have to built up confidence again... I started with 150 US $ and built up my real account to about 900 US $ in about 3 months time. Then I became greedy and wanted more.... So I changed my leverage and there it goes.... down the drain !! Have you tested your system on the lower time frames such as 5min and 15 min ? What Atr / RSI combination do you prefer for this time frames ? Carry on and happy trading ! Bernhard

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Thanks for ur wounderful feedback... well u can trade on lower time frames but chances of false signals becomes more...Although im getting some goood trades for more see results which i have posted...Only thing i hate is news time...coz its really becomes very crucial for any system... I,ll soon post my very simple scalping method with new simple indicators and for any chart user... And about Lower time frame...i,ll recommend to first to try my system on demo... on 15mints or 5Mints chart Set Rsi=5 &amp; ATR=10 Let other setting same.... But my systems best working is on 30Mints TF.... Recommended Pair= E/U.... Coz its less volatile and give u some pips also... Yes u can try my system on lower Tf,s But first practice on demo and also i have a lack of experience with Lower time frames but got good results ...Gooodluck

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Se e the screenshot for +35 pips for today...I was bit late but manage to get +35 pips....See how to enter in a perfect conditions &amp; see how to avoide from fake signals....All conditions must met before our entry...

--- 帖子 #343 ---
E/U Again looks in a sideways mood...So becareful before entry...Coz it seems to me bit slow also....So im just watching its movement...

--- 帖子 #344 ---
See the appurtunity in G/J....I just enter and get pips...

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Guys, I have noticed that the ATR20 and the RSI7 indicator gives different signals on MT4 compared to Umiars charting platform. Weird.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hammm i dont know i have no idea about that really coz as i mentioned lot of times that i dont use MT4....but see my previous posts in which i have mentioned the dragging and zooming problem for MT4 users....

--- 帖子 #347 ---
S ee below some of examples of my system with trendlines...I call them my trendlines...I dont care if someboday think that i have draw them wrong lolzzz but im researching onthem so far they are perfectly working for me to enter and also to avoide from false signals....See the screenshots How....?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
hey umair is it important for a long trade that the rsi and atr cross near the 30 level or they should just cross. BK

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Batter they should cross near 30-level or before 30-level for short and vice-versa for long...I there4 use ssto just to avoide from oversold/overbought region...Same as rsi also...If rsi crossed atr for short near 30-level or before it then according to me downtrend starts and once i find all signals with there respective conditions to met then i enter...

--- 帖子 #350 ---
So far im getting very good results from your system. great system man thanks for sharing with us. I am also a professional trader with more then five years of my experience and im looking forward to have a nice gentle chat on forex with you. You also seems to me a very good trader as trendlines working great with your system. Thanks again Umair

--- 帖子 #351 ---

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Dear Umair, Thanks for sharing your strategy with us, I like it becoasue its based on logic factors, and you just add also a Demark Trend line break, which also A good step for more improvments. I live also in Abu Dhabi, you can call me to talk about Forex 050-6633814

--- 帖子 #367 ---
If u think ur mentiond indicators working best for u then carry on man but try to focus more on ssto and trendlines....I think trendlines are good addition for perfect entry and to avoide from false sigals...

--- 帖子 #368 ---
So far i got very good results. i Know the importance of Ssto and trendlines thanks Umair

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Dont worry i,ll with in few days post a new and simple method of my same system without RSI &amp; ATR in a same thread as an alternative ....but in that method i,ll focus trendlines....Im working on it....

Herry and all other viewers... Im giving a tip about my existing system that how to enter..... Ok see your chart with the help of my system....put all indicators according to my system and then forget about all other indicators....accept P-SAR .....just see the series of P-SAR Dots for long and short....when first P-SAR Dot appears for example for long then and only then focus other indicators...judge by urself that they are fullfilling the entry requirments for long...? if they are then enter for long....so main purpose of all that is to focus only onthe movement of p-sar dot first then others to enter...

Herry u put all indicators in a perfect manner according to my system...but try to focus on p-sar dots...see ur chart after every half hour or five minutes before every half hour to over...just focus psar dots ...see all pairs according to my system ...if there is any first psar dot appears for long or short then see other indicators ...are they fullfilling ur entry requirments for long or short...if the others are then enter...if not then wait for another half hour and focus the same pair...
