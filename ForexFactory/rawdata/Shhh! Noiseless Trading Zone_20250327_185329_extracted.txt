I see change templates :-) Then I had a moment too, but then I gave her the ice to confuse me :-) good trades ....Otherwise RSI works quite reliably. But Doda I fired because I was puzzled, already showed the possible direction, but .. I just did not suit me :-) Stoch shows better and is especially important to have a sense, to determine the next possible trend ... When I get back, I'll try to explain how I see it :-)

Went for it today, Non Farm Employment change and our screwed up stalemated Goverment. Was looking for a spike up yesterday but didnt happen. Probably due due poor Eur economic news and better US news. Today US news, not as good and yes our lovely politicians that took their ball home and not gonna play together.

19.6% gain

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Yes, something like that :-) You held that position for so long and I witch you should visit is the result .. nice trade .. nice trade

It's me again this sleep and I had to take the remains top:-D

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Only held about 45 minutes. I cut way to many winners short, but i,ve been profitable. Looking to close 50% and let remainder run after BE set. If further movement move BE to first 50% close. Looking back at trades it would profit me to do so.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Jtee, as you must know, there is an error in MACD_Colored_v102 that keeps it from correctly drawing the two right-most bars of the "signal" line.  The attached  fixes that problem.  The line "limit=MathMin(Bars-SlowEMA,Bars-counted_bars+1)" is changed to "limit=MathMin(Bars-SlowEMA,Bars-counted_bars-1)".  The indi simply was not calculating the last two bars under certain conditions.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Yes noticed an issue and thought something was awry. Thanks Easy!

I took the day off and apparently so did everyone else. Love the renko candles. Better read on price action. John you cant argue your success, love what your doing. Keep it up! I've been 15 to 20 % per month on part time trading. I think you are going to exceed this by far.

Exactly reading chart to me is much easier and easier and even determining the S / R it read better.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi Friends,

I have a problem while solving the question :-) Renko is beautifully arranged and even indi to him by me respond much better. If we stick to the rule, such as the trade in the direction of Dragon + Stoch and RSI and account for 80% it works perfectly. If the market does happen to move elsewhere, so 80% goes off at BE or a smaller profit .... But sometimes a situation where Stoch is up and crawls like a snake along the top and bottom will not ... How to eliminate this? Yesterday I sat late into the night, thinking and testing what I might help to eliminate ... What is India? RSI is not much use, because Kdýr is Stoch above, we do not know whether it will still RSI up or down ... We need to determine whether it is still possible growth ... or fall .... I tried to add more Stoch, but in a different setting (15,5,3,), then the question arises whether we need to turn the original Stoch, who while handing out more pips, but she may experience a situation that I write ... many .. ..

Everything You display the graphics, because that's probably too much sense not to:-D

I will be very glad if you share any ideas ...

The best time for trading Renko + proper function indicator (for me) is 1500-1700 (USA 0300pm-0500P?) Just this afternoon:-D

Hello John Chipsa,

I tried to send you PM, but I can't for some reason. I'm currently developing similar stategy, my entries are on pullbacks in direction of a trend (buying on higher lows/ selling on lower highs). I trade on 5 pip Mean Renko chart. I'm currently not using any oscillators as filters, the most important for me if to know if there is a trend or no. I use THV Coral as main trend direction filter (very similar results as with Dragon). I'm using couple more tools to filter my trades, just testing them to know what might be useful. I'm also testing different exit strategies, my goal is to have RRR>1, optimal RRR is 2 or higher, but it's not always possible, it depends which pullback I'm trading. Higher I buy (or lower I sell), lower RRR I have. First pullback is always best for high RRR, but not always is entry signal also. Sometimes I don't have clear entry signal until second pullback, and possible RRR is lower. Is it possible to speak or chat with you on skype? I would like to discuss about our systems, maybe we will find out something useful. If you are interested please send me PM.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hello,

I will certainly be happy if someone will work together and come up with new ideas. I have Skype :-) But I would like and I think that Jtee1 other if (Unless you from your side it is not secret) that we discussed here in the thread and the public. Share ideas and maybe someone else something happens to cry .. everybody else is looking at things, a different idea .. understanding .... because I was for the discussion and resolution of the matter right here .... There are few successful people, who are divided and I like to share on because what works and brings me ... does not mean that others will ...... I know what was my quest for forex, how difficult it is to find the right answer ...

So share your thoughts and see where we move

Hi all .

I tested the new system , which, as seems to be really good to use for my purposes . Since I was looking for something I can identify trends and especially filtorvat and eliminate unnecessary false signals . A few days later I drove through various sites and when something intrigued me so I tested a while . Unfortunately not been heard me right in the eye ( I tested it for a long time and quality) but I remembered the one thing that I had discovered her but I was misunderstood (I was young and did not understand souvyslosti forex , etc. ... ) It is nothing than good old Woody CCI . I downloaded quite a lot indicator , various fixes, version , etc. ... And I gave it dokupy what might really work well . Type your rules , but it is still a BETA version of the rules and I will be happy if we collectively shape the rules , or at least I write notes on what you missed . :-)

Personally, I try to find a system that will generate quality rather than quantity .I want to work with larger volumes ( 1-3 lots ) and less time. I do not want to spend endless hours at the PC before I come Signal ( now it is obviously necessary to test and find the right time to trade).

1 - Renko bar , I finally decided to 3pips bar .

2 - Panel WCCI

3 - Stepchoppy v1.2a

4 - LSMA EMA

Rules ? Testing :-) ( Rules that might work descriptions in the chart )

HI

You have Renko 5 pips?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Add RSI 14

1 - UP +50

2 - Down -50

Check whether the trend has the opportunity to grow. And in order not to enter the top trend.

Top 70/30 in this area and I bought does not enter.

Everything looks OK, and that trend will continue, but to eliminate the trend end? RSI shows a level of 70, therefore the market is overbought and will be corrected, or go down ...

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hiya Pard

Rules are pretty much in the first post for system. But market opens and news i treat seperately regardless of indicators. Just look for signs of continuation or reversal at market opens through fundamental news and from there its pure speculation. When up 5 pips its BE time and eliminate most losses with system, that I believe has made me profitable. It has eliminated some good winners also, but i just get back in on next signal. I set alot of straddle trades at consolidation  periods and wait for breakouts either way and manage from there. Usually it only hits one stop order and goes. I just let the market get me in and make the decision for me. Been a good month already up 38%. Summer months averaged 20% and had to work at that.

Just look at us opens and see the patterns. Statistically it will reverse, but i play both sides with straddle trade. The 5 or 15 min donchian breakout or just high or low of consolidation plus 5 pips.

In above pic i added a longer period ichimoku for referance. Every indicator is just a line in the sand that price crosses. I still love to scalp the 1 min thv but this is more long term trading or trying to catch the runner. As you see from yesterday. I was not home yesterday and lost 90.00 on phone trading.

Post 69 chart zoom. Break of yesterdays high and all triggers meet for system to buy on same candle. 1 2 3 pattern already eastablished and broken. New HH and LH. Both ichimoku says buy long and short term. Still no guarantee on outcome just entry. Most important part is to manage trade. Friday is good time to take profit and get out I was up almost $200 and closed with 2.8%.

Well done

Nice plan and very simialar to what i set. You may want to take 1/2 at tp and let other half run. Trade times are very important 3-6 am est 8-11 est and S & R levels are so easy to spot with renko charts. You will catch some good runners only if you let a percentage ride past your 20 tp. Depending on type of news and trend or countertrend trade i adjust my tp.

Watch for 123 patterns and trade them.

I let the market get me in and i always play both sides. You have to be right when you play both sides. Much like todays Euro news forecast, it was all wrong. thats why i set buy stop last night before going to bed. I Thought no Brainer there its going up tommorow. I Just got lucky there, but I only risked $10 to gain $60 with .2 lots but 5 pip ts stopped me out at $27.00. I missed the best part of london session, was sleeping.

Hi,

share you MACD colored v105 mod? Thanx

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Cleaned up template and new Template on first page also. to many redundancies, but i was looking for filters. Main difference is added 15 rsi which mimics TDI when combined with 5 RSI i had on.  With RSI you can see a better LL or HH difference. Waiting for Waddah attar explosion to break MA seems to be a bigger moving trade.  Early entry would be Waddah attar explosion and colored macd = same color and 5 rsi crossed 50 line and crossed over 15 RSI. If you get in earlier definately set BE at 5 pips profit and can always re-enter if it hits BE and signals again. Pay attention to wicks on candles for possible trend change.

SL hit, -15, ouch. Gonna use my kumo cloud

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I always treat news releases seperate regardless of indicators. Today is friday and i am usually more cautious today. A large move in any direction usually has a correction of decent size. Short answer is its a judgement call. Yesterday i set stops at points where waddah would reach above moving average and were inside the cloud but very close to coming out. A good 123 pattern is hard to resist. I also try to use candles to left to get in at close of candle plus spread on buys bottom of candles for sell. So candle closes and valid signal.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
My biggest loss yesterday was a 15 min prior to news. Do you have scripts for placing stop orders and a straddle order also?  You can drag and drop. It was a good entry other then prior to news, which i had to scold myself for yesterday. I also missed a good trade posting yesterday while you took a smoke break.

MM speaking, I was using since two days the following rule of thumb

SL 15

TP 20

BE +5 (close half lot)

Standard TS at 10 (TS 10)

Everything enforced with MPTM EA.

However this has been a source of frustration in terms of R:R. Many trades won at half lot +5pip, but the first "full lot" loosing trade is killing all the profits.

I am looking for something simplier (or not), but more efficient.

Price moved down at us open on weak news and more on forecasted news. 10:00 News came out opposite of forecast, price stopped and reverrsed. I had buy limit set at low of morning,after a move up and waiting for a spike down to take out stops. I was already in when I posted buy price. .Short answer buy due to fundementals and price stalling out. It's all an educated speculation. I expected traders closing out trades from 11 to 12 am and price to trickle north.

Busy day today at work very little time to trade.

5 pip renko mean adjust the "renko boxsize" to 5.0?

A beautiful example of the emerging trend.

1 - Closure of the 50 ema (you can also use as a potential output / input, but I have not tested), of course, if the conditions are met ...

2 - RSI and Stoch the surface 50

3 - Waddah přkročil deadzone 400, so the demonstration that there is something (RSI and Stoch confirmed it)

4 - MACD crosses and in color (such certificate or filter and používách him as "Slow Stoch" which burrows for up to ...)

Of course no one can know what the trend arises Longer-term? Short term? So it is up to each of us as the counting starts MM :-)

I mostly erased all my profits today :/

Stupid decisions.

let's start over next week ! good week end all !

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Then again, I was wondering, because seeking clearly defined inputs, I have a problem with it, I can see all the action, which is wrong :-( I went through the forum and I found something, we'll see how it works ..

I did a preview of the image, so let's see if you can try, which I also appreciate, everything is plotted on the image. :-) I drew the perfect outputs, which of course is not possible, because we do not know how long it will take to that side, but as we all know:-D but only for overviews

Do I threw MACD, because it shows much like Waddah and to him I put Stoch (12,9,26) but the truth is much to it .... Aside

A Combo added RSI (8) and CCI (14) Buying / Selling in color (blue / red)

The base is therefore governed by a bit, but the idea remains the same

--- 帖子 #211 ---
All my trades last week were at market openings and news releases with a mental picture of what way I expected currency to go. I set stop orders both side of fence approximately 3 minutes ahead of release. This is due to many times currency will move at pre release and take off. Once i see outcome of news I will delete the one stop order that is on the wrong side of news or replace it with a limit order to catch the proverbial head fake and get in at a better price. I do not take every signal, nor would i suggest anyone else. I pay close attention to support and resistance also which is very easy to see with Renko bars.
The news outcome is your best indicator not the forcast. Its your only leading indicator other then the ichimoku kinko hyo all the others are lagging but essential to some degree. Again nothing is ever for certain. Ichimoku traded in its purest sense guards against losses and lets your runners run. As seen here

Hi Jtee,

Very nice trading. I have few question hopefully you could share with us.

1) What platform you currently use? I see you using M3 chart rather than M2? Is there any differences?

2) Is there any differences between the renko you bought and the one used by others (free download) here?

Alpe

--- 帖子 #215 ---
M3 is what i named my chart no difference other than that. Metatrader 4

My candles have the ability to use wicks or not. I like the wicks they start showing a possibility of trend reversals or weakness in market and leave a history of it. Not sure what it shows on their chart as it happens. I'm sure there is a sign of something happening.
JTee1

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hello all !

Wish you many pips this week !

@Jtee1, can you say again your ichimoku settings ? I see you added a long term trend kumo ?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I'd go for a Combo RSI/CCI of 15/15 for a best filtering (w/ Renko 5 pips) don't you think ?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
congratz mate that's impressive !

Had hard times and loss 20% :/

I need a strict, simple, rule of a thumb money management rule.

TP/SL/TS "fits it all" rules. Being discretionnary is too difficult at the moment, I don't have the "artist" mind yet.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
minimum 1 to 1 R:R ratio with 15 to 20 pip sl on renko system.  I prefer 20 pip sl, but if news says i'm in trade the right way i will put in another buy to get a better price while in draw down. If market gets me in pre news and release of news says opposite of my position i will get out and take loss.  My  big $110.00 loser today would have won with 20 pip sl. But would've and should'ves didnt set sl I did.

It's a fight but the news gives you the artist mind or confidence to ride it or add to a negative position. Your tp,sl is only one way to manage a trade adding to a negative position with news release in your favor is another. I like a 2% acount risk, but will double down at times. Only if news is with your position.

Been enjoying my retirement and some golf and very little trading. Been trying to hold trades longer and most have been off of my phone. I'm usually out and about while I'm trading. I've set and looked at charts to long for to many years. I'm Using 4 hr through 5 min tf.. with 15 min as my trigger. News plus daily traits of charts. Typical reversal times due to session trades closing out of the trend and reversing, theses are shorter trades. Then back to a  continuation trades after us session and mid Asian sessin.

Watch price action at certain times of each session and you will see the patterns that repeat almost daily.

Great trades JTee !!

What are your rules to enter in these trades ?

Thanks ;-)

--- 帖子 #363 ---
This last trade was taken off of previous resitance. 4 hr trend was down 15 min chart was reversing after US open and was heading into resistance. Typical trade is based off abounce off of resistance and 20 ma on 15 min tf with higher tf trend.   Previous resistance was key along with going back to trend. Hope this helps.

Have been travelling to Asia then came back and right now like Chipsa have a bit of personnal issues, plus, it's difficult to emulate Big J.T. talent and posting my last demo trials would have been a bit discouraging.

But i've kept monitoring this thread and will keep on.

I dunno what to focus, tho. Renko or simple chart setups. The setups are changing all the time

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Okay, my lame way.

Entry short as per stochastics touching 80 on M15, as a trigger.

H4 below EMA20 as a higher TF filter.

SL on last spike. TP=SL.

TP on EMA 20 on M15 if possible.

Can't get any simplier.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Looks very reasonable. track your progress and go for it.

I like the renko bars for clarity, but I'm out and about most of the time. Therefore no renko on my phone. I flip through time frames and make a decision on trend then consider any news plus look for support and resistance and consider time of day and look for patters that are repetitive with that typical currency. I wish I could explain it better.
I trade trend and reversals, the reversals at support and resistance go against everything on the renko chart. But that's a riskier trade and just how it is. With every good move there is usually a good reversal. It's not a gut feeling it's more of a pattern thing off of previous  Support or Resistance. But it doesn't take long to figure out its not working out and take a loss. Then you lick your wounds and move on.

I know what your feeling, I've been there and still feel it.

I think I have read somewhere that, the new MT4 600 builds has changed of .HST file format.

I guess that could create many problems with Renko or Range bars generator since they are writing offline charts.

I am interested in getting feedback whether your Renko generator works well or not on build 600 !

Been setting sl on previous highs or lows of 10 pip renko bars. sometimes as high as 50 pips. But I've also been going for 1:1 ratio of sl for tp. Has had some larger drawdowns, but also been trading 2 lots at times. Going to scale back trade sizes to keep sl at a 3% level of risk. 3% is approaching $600 at present.

n market for about 20 minutes total today. I was out and about with friends but made a 100.00. Every hour of the market has its own peculiarities.  Just got to be aware of what's happening or is going to happen.  But those peculiarities aren't a given.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Getting several pm's on trades. Charts have 3 moving averages 2-5 ma's one is applied to open and the other is applied to the closed price.  Then I have a 20 ma applied to close. I like 4 or 5 ma's to be going in direction of trade on the 1,5,15 minute trade. I like the 1 min tf to be close to or on the opposite side of 20 ma and then a turn of the 5 ma back to trend of the majority of ma's. Then close when in profit as soon as possible,  unless a news release in your favor.  Clarification (I consider the 2-5 ma's as 1 ma in my count of ma's going in one direction).JTee1:-)

More then any system or indicator try to know the market patterns at certain times of the day. Definitely news time but also ranging and retracement times ( when market makers are taking profits ) If I had to categorize times it would be as follows. These are what I am thinking at these periods. IMHO

EST

3-6am movement

6-8am ranging

8-11am movement and more of a London reversal over 50% of the times

11-12am retracing

12-1pm ranging

1-3pm more of a continuation of 8-11's move

U/J  $144 perfect entry on ichimoku at market open

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Can u explain your Strategy a bit more?

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Post 464 is the best example of a trade. the 15 and 5 min tf show an up trend for a buy. The 1 min is a trigger for entry which is a break through of the cloud to trend. Best when after news release and in direction of news. Its that simple. With that said read up on ichimoku trading and watch for trading into support or resistance lines. I will get out at next S/R point and will get back in after S/R is broke or respected. Support and resistance off of a higher tf and the higher the better. I trade E/U and U/J in the appropriate session time. SL AND TP is your choice. This is one way of many ways to trade. I trade renko bars as seen on initial post but not on my mobile and I'm out and about. Retired and playing golf, beach etc.

EST
3- 6 am trend trade
630-730 look for retracement.
8-11 am trend trade
1130 to 1230 look for retracement
1-3 return to trend
Nothing is for certain its a game of probabilities, take your losses and move on.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Nice trade. How do u know that support is going to hold?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
You dont know! Support held 4 times earlier and it was lunchtime and it usually is ranging at that time. You have to pull the trigger some where. Its a calculated risk. The market gave me that support area. I had a tight stop set. shhh listen to the market, it talks to you all day. We just have to listen.Jtee1;-)

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Stress Free Trading its a matter of time until you hit the good runner. Simple rules. Keeps SL low and lets runners run. The only indicator is price. Regardless of what we think we know its price action that determines where the money is. Simple 123 patterns or a good trend then a retrace with a move back to trend.

FEB 1 hr chart and 5 pip renko bars

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Jan 1 hr chart with 5 pip renkos

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I write this because of pm's I get asking me what are the rules of my trading. These are the simplest rules I Know 5 pip renko bars filters the noise. You trade 1,2,3 patterns plus 5 pip breakout for reversals and retrace and back to trend. These are time tested rules of trading. Cut your losses on a reversal bar and set up for next trade. Have an emergency sl in place approximately 15 - 17 pips and follows with 5pip jumps and preferably hidden from broker. The market can and will move fast at times you must have orders placed Buy stop and sell stops. Poised and waiting for the move. All trades should be based on something the market has proved with no assumptions, this is important. Either news, price action or prior support or resistance. SHHHHH the market is talking to you, just listen.

Roughly 18,600 for Jan Feb March April on the above charts, and its impossible to trade every minute of the day. Human error will be a factor but emotions should not be with above system. When I trade renkos I have a script with sl built in and I drag it along moving it every 5 pips with the direction of the retrace waiting for a move back to trend. I also have a trade set at a 123 pattern plus 5 pips the opposite way of trend waiting for a reversal. These are the only two triggers you should have to worry about. I trade off my phone a lot but look at renko charts before leaving the house and will set the reversal trade. On my phone I rely a lot on Prior Support and resistance levels

I have taken 13,283.37 since Jan 1 only trading 2-4 hours a day at most and a lot of it has been buy the pool or on the golf course with my phone, but I trade 2 lots on average. This removes the stress and noise from the market. You decide. Simplest way to trade I know of. Demo until you prove to yourself you can be profitable.

JTee1   Disclaimer the last 4 charts were on 1hr 5 pip renko bars and will show up differently then 1 min charts with 5 pip renko bars. They show a larger history then 1 min charts. The proof is in the trading and traders own hands. Every trader would trade this differently and every renko bar can start at a different price. Every ones results would be different.

Further Explanation for newer traders

thats a nice way^^

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Last 13 days on a 1 min chart in very ranging conditions. 150 pips high to low in 13 days.

Second chart in black outline is the same period on a 1hr chart as the first chart in 1min. Theory the same but 1 hr. shows more history.

Summary 1 min more trades and 170 more profit. I would use 1 min chart to trade its more accurate.

Hi Jtee,

I want to congratulate you for sharing your experience !!

When do you trade with the Renko system and when do you trade in 1min TF with Ichimoku strategy ?

To trade with 1 lot on EUR/USD, what balance do you suggest ?

Many thanks friend.

Wish you green pips.

Cheers,

Goodgame42.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I trade 1 min tf when I cant be close to pc. Which Is frequent. Minimum 5000 acct on 5 pip renko bars a SL of 2 renko bars plus spread should keep losses at a 2 to 2.5% of acct. And thats with a US broker with 50:1 leverage. Jump stop 5 pips at every new candle in trade direction I always look at r enko charts before leaving the house and look what way to trade and S&R levels.Jtee1 :-)

--- 帖子 #546 ---
hello J!

i have  a q.

i dont understand why this renko is having a longer wick then 5 pips and didnt form another renko brick - as it is not time related and it just should paint a new solid brick instead of a long wick.

do u have some explanation or a way how u look at it or how does it effect you or not when this happens?

any input will help to understand it better.

thank you

--- 帖子 #547 ---
just realized,,,maybe  5 pisp didnt happen from the ''END'' of the previous bar in the prevailing direction ,maybe just 4 - thats why the wick,,,but complete 5 pips from the opposite edge of previews bar....and if it stays within no bar is formed...

i dont have proper renko bars yet at the moment so i just guess.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Looks correct to me. a new bar will only form above or below a previous bar. No bars will form side by side. And the wicks are a good sign of weakness and imitate a hanging hammer pin bar. I think this is what your referring to.

May see bounce north with a new trend heading south 123 pattern. So far news leading us south. This is where fundamentals play in to trading. A bounce north if we get it will be profit taking around 11-12 est. Let price tell you.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
If no move north before lunch and sideways flag until 1 est I am looking south after lunch. Again price must confirm. Just my thoughts No move north means traders are holding on to trades and not taking profit yet.

When it's 10am for your broker, it's 2pm for mine.

How do you filter false break of cloud because if we trade at each break of cloud we loss...

Many thanks.

Every good trend has a good reversal we'll see getting in at rock bottom

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I look for my biggest breakouts at news time. we are in a 3 hour sideways movement at present wait for a move then get in on retrace and break with move direction.

Again times of day are relevant how the market usually behaves. Not an exact science but calculated risk. We don't want to trade just to trade. set your clock for news times to alert you to pc.  Then listen to the market. Plot support and resistance lines try not to trade into one or at least get in at a price where there is room to make money. Hope this helps.

Hello,

after a long break I'm back a little to contribute and perhaps even help :-) Before I go back over the border.

It's only a test version, because my real money on real trading might arrive in a few months. Until then ... test ... test ... test :-)

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Just a quick question JTee1 - you normally set a 20 pip SL on your trades but I see that you rarely let it reach the 20 pips. What triggers you to cut a loss short rather than let it play out.

Just trying to get my head around what you are looking for to tell you the trade might not go your way.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
20 sl  is more of an emergency stop but other side of cloud is stop for ichi trade, news trade previous high or low. depending on distance but when in profit I look for weakness and get out when I think its about to reverse. Then I look for re-entry instead of drawdown.  my tp of 80 will let the news trade take off and catch the runners.

Hi JTee1

Can you explain how you use the triangles on chart?. Few pages ago you've shown pure price action rules on renko - very valuable piece of information. On the other hand your last screenshot shows that you mostly don't comply those rules. Does it have anything to do with triangles?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I left a lot of money on the table as you can see with trades on chart but I you also see no losses due to sl moved to Breakeven very quickly. I would be content with $50-100 a day. I love to trade but I'm trying to spend less time trading and more time playing. Fridays and non news times I trade differently. Triangles mark divergence only looking for a reversal of trend or a good pullback. Fridays chart was 2 pip renko bars with 75% brick shift. Price has to move 1.5 pip for new brick to form and 3.5 pip for a reversal brick. Renko bars have less noise and sl moves into place very quickly if not tp first. You must find a point to pull the trigger and manage it from there, both are equally important

The Sonic pva candles and volume was the biggest influence on trading that day, you'll notice trades were around higher volume bars. Bigger is not always better.

Oh I Forgot one thing sell the highs and buy the lows

Thanks -

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Initial sl is 15 pips on my stop order script and 100 tp but I re-adjust to previous high or low. Also depends on what I banked already that day also depends on time of day. A hard fast sl and tp can be your worst enemy or best friend. But previous high is the best sl. I also look at a 5 and10 pip renko chart.

Hiya Patient pip, things going well here, I hope same with you. I have to keep a business running to qualify for a  SOLO 401K. At least until 59 1/2 to avoid penalties. Great method to use to fund forex account, grows tax free and you have checkbook control to invest as you see fit real estate, stocks etc.. Later in life (59 1/2) you draw it out as needed or I use it as a my personal bank. You loan to yourself and you make the interest yourself.  Typical 401k you can't do that. Great way to build wealth. My business is www.totalcondocare.com unfortunetly its a necessary evil.

Added sell stop to trade at break of prior low, trade triggered 5 min prior to news release. Done for the day going to the pool before the afternoon rain gets here.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
The last 6 or seven posts describe my trade. Starting with two positions at market open. Poor economic news overnight for the Euro, good news forecasted for US, but many times forecasts are wrong. Hence the 2 opposing positions. Set stop orders with a little wiggle room and adjusting them as needed prior to release, but keeping in mind the typical move opposite of news or aka head fake. News release 830 good for dollar and against a weakening Euro. Close buy stop and look for sell. All news today looking good for dollar. I always try to get in at a better price, sell high or buy low. But not always possible and can be dangerous, leave room for trade to move but was willing to close manually at break of prior high and get in at a better position.

This is why I don't set hard fast rules for technical trades at session opens or news. I usually get the message of why are you trading opposite of your system.

Todays results.

For the technical only traders, you can be statistically profitable.

For the fundamental traders you can be as profitable as the market makers allow. MM have to take profit and someone has to lose for them to win.

Every good run has to reverse for profit taking. They can see your stops and take them out.

I get many private messages asking for entry positions.

I trade with technical indicators but try to sell the highs and buy the lows, trying to get in on the fundamentals at the extreme end of the swings, when its ready go the back to the trend.  I do take reversal positions of the market trends when I believe they they are taking profit. This allows for tighter stops above the support or resistance lines.

My favorite trades are either 1,2,3 patterns as my first trade today or Support and resistance areas with small scalps at resistance of high tested several times today.

My long term trading is 50/50, but my scalping or day trading is almost 80/20.

Hi JTee1, congratulations on your results. Your trading system is truly impressive. I have read the whole thread but I couldn't understand what are your rules for entry and exit.

Would you be so kind as to repeat them, for everyone, and update the first post so as to make easier the understanding of your operations to newcomers?

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Best rules I can establish is study the fundamentals look a week ahead and trade the fundamentals. look for weak points to enter market preferably with stop or limit orders and let the market come to you. I do believe the first post rules are profitable but you still need to have a good idea of what's driving the market. If I could only use one indicator it would be the ichimoku. I wish I could put it into one set of defined rules, I don't sell the market when I get a sell signal when fundamentals say otherwise.
Best advice is watch support and resistance levels and set stop and limit orders with trend when upcoming fundamentals agree with trend. The limit orders can get you in at a better price with tighter stop set at previous resistance. For you to win someone else has to lose and they don't like to.
Hope this helps.

Hey JTee1 can i ask you what settings your using on your ranko chart? are you using the rankolivechart_v6 script whit boxsize=2 rankotime=275boxshift=75 ?

--- 帖子 #798 ---

V6 I typically use box size = 6 renko time = anything but standard tf then box shift =50

Ichimoku counter trend trade. All indicators are just lines in the sand. But Ichi  tells many stories at a single glance and its deriving its info from price action that's stabilized by the Renko bar. You can predict entries and exits for stop orders more reliably. You see support and resistance points much easier.

Simple Trade setups in yellow with entries marked in pink then manage. Higher lows or lower highs then 10-15 move with direction of new LH or HL. You decide.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Closed at Resistance and upcoming news release. I get a lot of pm's asking for rules.

Here's the Easiest rules there are. Renko takes all the noise out of the way, Times of day and market habits plus news releases are the other factors. Of course money management. 2% risk max.

Hope this helps.

JTee1

Patience, plus ability to deal with losses.

Of all trades today 1st and 3rd were higher risk trades. 2nd trade was more of a classic trade, got in earlier then normal  because resistance was to close for normal entry. With that said sl was less to. Tradeoff smaller sl to leave room for profit to target or S/R.

i made a new trade on the dobbel top.

Please tell me the rules?

1. Trading on break of the clouds? And why the chart has to be m2 tf?

2. Any other rules? Cuz sometimes there is a conflicting trades when I see OP's trades. Can you shed some light on that?

Thanks

Hey Togu.

Am new to this system, so im the wrong one to ask. but if you look through the pages you will find some very good tips and rules whit pic.

And read some of JTee1 posts they are very good...

On the pic above, i close the trade and got 50 pips

Thks for ur reply,

So it is more of discretionary trades rather than technical entries? How do you reflect on news feeds? Do you trade before the news or after? Sorry to question you alot of questions but i found amusing how you pick your trades. There are great!!!

About support/resistance, is it the basic recent high/lows or some complicated MAs, FIBO/Pivots? And where can i find the live renko indicator which u r using.

Thanks

Togu

--- 帖子 #830 ---
I'll take my questions back, reading every trader's opinion got me confused. Now I see how you trade, it's suprising that you've been trading with one system for along time and built your account size to respectable level. kudos

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Simple strategy

--- 帖子 #833 ---
It's different from 123. And what time frame should we use?

What do you think? shorted because it was breaking the resistance.

I don't have an experience with renkos, but with this setup, Am I seeing the 1m tf or 2m tf on my renko chart? Also I'd like to know how I could use it on longer time frames like 1h-4h etc. I can't seem to use another offline chart maybe it's conflicting with its m1 chart. Does it have to like it has different magic number?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #834 ---
First trade of the week. 15 pip drop in price equivalent to 3 renko bars then entry. Trade was on phone, not at home.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Excellent entry. I put renko ea or script, depending on which renko you use on 1 minute timeframe. Open offline chart under new timefrane name.m2 is what i use. Not sure what size bars your using. But you should be seeing the size you set in ea or script.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Another quick scalp

--- 帖子 #837 ---
I'm using renkolivechart ea.

Inputs: RenkoBoxSize set to 5.0 and I'm using on 5 digit broker alpari. Maybe the boxsize is too small?

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Great entries and you have the right idea. Yes setting should be 50 for Box size. With that being said I will use a setting of 10 to trade during the ranging market times.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
I'm home at pc now. Here is first trade signal after market opening on the renko charts that I took on my phone metatrader.  Its Sunday and slow time I took the 200 and ran with it.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
No trade

--- 帖子 #841 ---
yeah, renko makes it easier to spot price action, I use price action trading on weekly candles. that's why there is only one ichimoku indicators and no others. I don't trade on Mondays but I just had to experience it. Very promising.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Here's what I would be looking for if I was trading tonight. I look for action Tuesday Wed. I will probably trade Monday opening of US session.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Your first trade was same like mine, but having the different renko bars, what made you to short? Is it the support line breaking?

Hey JTee,

Been watching your trades for a while now and I'm truly impressed!

few questions.

What time of day do you usually trade?

When you have an open trade is there certain times you look to close them? If so what is the general concept?

Thanks,

Just like right now the US session will retrace 70% of the time from London Session. But I wont take it unless there is a 123 pattern which may result In a buy soon. I expect price to touch low of today and move back to buy. Will it happen who knows but that's my game plan.

Here you go. Let the market show you where its going and get in.

BB I lose but I go right back at it after loss. I take the next available signal, but I keep time of day as a reference to what normally happens the retracement periods or trades closing for profit. When you get nervous on entries that's when you miss the next big move. I've made that mistake to many times.

This is what i See, do not take this as the gospel but what way the E/U should go with news forecast. News outcome can be different then forecasted.

I am in trade for a buy late friday betting there will be a gap on opening in the buy direction as a correction from last week.  Will close at opening bell and reverse if in profit to catch the close of the gap.

hai JTee1,

i am also using similar system to yours but i use filters, but what will be your exit?, i am trying ti find a good exit but exit strategy never worked

--- 帖子 #964 ---
hai JTee1,

I have learned something from your thread , so its time to give back, i am sending the following indicator to you, it is in testing phase please analyze the indicator and tell how to improve it. basically it will alert on 123 setup and double bottom and double top, but i have put a special filter so the indi will accurately pinpoint  these things
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

it has following  inputs,

alerts == false: if you turned this as true, then it will send the alert to your email and notification, for getting emails you should set your email at mt4

trendlines == false; if you turned this as true it will draw trend line  from last signal to current signal.

please leave other two options untouched, it is not necessary

please check your pm, and let me know

--- 帖子 #965 ---
I try and restrict my trading to The london session and first half of US session. I also didn't see where you attached the indicator to your post. But I use the cloud for tp points from the past. But the news forecast plays an important part in that decision also.

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Hai Jtee1,The indicator is not yet finished, it is in testing phase , so if I attach in forum every one can download, if the indi sucks, your thread crediablity will be in danger, so I will send u personaly , you analyze it, then we wil release it.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Thought there would be a correction in the form of a gap over the weekend. Thats why i bought late friday before closing.  I guess this is the correction, all news for Euro says sell. No stimuli coming up in US session.

Hi JTee1

Do you make any use of your indicators? I ask because I see that your entries are mostly pure price action and sometimes your interpretation of fundamentals.

And the entries are perfect - do you wait for price to come back to perfect place after creating a brick or you are just quick or use pending orders?

And I see that you don't care about S/R and such - you trade based on nearest left and time of the day tendencies, do I see properly?

And I must say that reading your thread cures my resentment for EURUSD - I used to dislike this pair but seeing how you dance with it is so releasing.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
I let the market react and i flow with it. It's talking we just don't listen all the time. My precepts of what way the market should be going ihelps and hurts me. The Renko just eliminates the chatter.

Your synopsis of my trading is 100% accurate, Bravo. Thanks

So let's look at situation as on the picture - price goes nicely up and retraces - you put buy stop on the top of the highest brick and wait how situation develops. May be even moving down the pending order if price continues down but not too far.

Krystyn my fist day live trading i lost 7-800 dollars. I demo traded a year solid  prior with 15 pip sl and 15 pip tp. First day live I bailed on all 11 trades early that day. Reality was I should of won 9  and had 2 losses per my rules that day but i bailed early on every trade. That translates to $1350 - $300 = $1050 . But I lost almost $800 dollars. End of one week my account was down 0ver 30%. I was trading one full lot per trade. I adjusted my lot size to .3 lots per trade and I was much more comfortable trading and within a month regained my losses and i slowly increased my lot size.  5k became 10k them 30k in under a year. Don't give up take the next signal This is the easiest trading i've ever done. Set your trading time and Demo for 3 months. I would trade london session exclusively if those times work for you . I use to get up at 2 am to 6 am everyday and then go to work. This took a toll on me. Our biggest obstacle is ourselves. I hate to say it but you could flip a coin and be right 50% of the time in forex. I use to set BE at 5 pips profit and then trailed by 10 pips. I very rarely had a loss and I may be going back to that. It will keep losers to a minimum but you will miss some runners unless you get back in again.
Their will be losses. I beleive you know that.

Thank you for your words.

Looking left I see lots of money today. I'll spend good few hours at weekend training eyes in price action. London opens 9.00 my time so at least I don't have to push myself to trade. It apparently is a psychological problem - to take next signal after loss. So I will test all data available on my platform and will make statistics testing different options of trade management.

A year ago I made coin flip experiment - one month and around 230 positions SL 50 TP 100 and SL - 30 TP 90. Outcome was BE. Later I've read about other experiment - also coin flip but SL- 150pips TP 450 pips and it occured to be profitable - such breath makes possible to take trend that is visible on Daily candles.

Hi JTee , First of all thanks a lot for sharing your results and system with hell lot of traders here. It will definitely be of inspiration / gold mine for atleast few of them.

I am also following up your thread from last couple of weeks and definitely there is an improvement i can see in my trading a/c. Thanks to you again.

I have one small query - can we set multiple renko charts in one profile ? In one of your recent chart posted above i can see EUR/USD and USD/JPY in same profile. Actually i am trying this from last one week but it is not working for me (though the first renko currency chart will work flawlessly , but the second one will not move if i add it in the same profile). Do i need to change any setting ?

Please provide your valuable inputs.

Happy trading

Cut winner short. On the hindsight looks bad but this trade was going for 2 hours endangering my SL or dancing around BE. Closed it half hour before NY open being afraid of NY reversal. This time wrong but too many times hesitated around BE on positions running too long time and took full SL.

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Just woke up. But yes wise decision. Doesnt look like much stimuli on the calender. I guarded everything close yesterday and i faired well. Even Asian session i will post later. I'm in a buy now just because of the US reversal you were worried about.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Asian session results. Most were off of 1 min chart and when in profit set small trailing stop 2 pips. Locked profit but allowed room for growth if it continued, no losses again my lucky day.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Mahajans thanks for the kind words. Answer is yes you can set up different size renkos for same currency and on different pairs. You just need to put ea on different 1 min chart and then open another offline chart for the same currency you put ea on. I can put a drain on pc though. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
One thing I relearned was dont beat yourself up for taking profit, especially when there is no stimuli that could have told you otherwise. I expected to much from the asian session the other night and let 3 winners become losers. Good entries and reason to enter trade  but bad trade management at least BE then re enter later.

[quote=Krystyn;7793669]Nope - I thought it was higher low and opportunity to go long.[/quote]

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Yes thats what i see.
Monday news for euro is buy. Bank holiday for US.

Tuesday German Economic sentiment is a big factor and is sell. So i would look to sell a double top Monday afternoon if I was looking for a longer term position. Some of the time at 4-6 pm est I will do a smaller lot trade on the next days news with a sl at 2nd high or low back. Adjusting lot size for 2 % risk, to many times market opens will take out a previous high or low to only go the other way.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Price was going down and news release was ever so slightly in favor of USDollar so Euro should go down. Which it did. and this system gets you in usually on a retrace and back to trend at a better price. So your not buying the highs or selling the lows. There is room for profit instead of buying at the end of a trend. Retrace then first brick back to trend is entry. Unless there is other stimuli telling you something else.
Formula is Stimulus - Retrace - move back to stimuli= enter then manage trade is safest trade. But as you see stimuli can be trader habits closing trades for profit. Also everyone piles on trades at a break of previous lows but we should already be in at better price and reap the reward

1 min chart buystop and buy limit order set

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Krystyn

Here is from 3 am until noon ( in the blue box) which is all of london session for last week. I marked entry points and all are valid signals plus taking opening candle of market if its above or below cloud. The first half of session fairs better. All buy stop orders would be placed at top of next candle plus spread. If not price would be hit before candle is formed. Sell stops are set at exact price new candle would be formed ( no reason to allow for spread). SL at conception is prior high or low plus spread. Hope this helps, London session is easier to trade.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
JTee1 thank you for your effort in showing me those examples. Also notice about pending orders seems so obvious when you written about them but I didn't thought about it before.

Today I've done test of EURJPY (low spread, good enough movement and I don't have most of this chart in my head) since 8th August.

Stripped everything off my chart and using F12 to pretend it is live. Trying to read nearest left price action. Quite surprised that it took me almost all day (with necessary breaks). There were places where price was nicely readable but in others I was sitting and thinking - what do I see?. Looking at your charts - ichimoku is helpful in such situations.

My settings - SL 15 TP 30, 2% risk and 3 different options of management:

BE after 5 pips - 300 pips (28% up)

BE after 15 pips - 660 pips (72% up)

Waiting till TP or SL hit - 750 pips (82% up)

Of course there were some situations that SL or TP were just licked by price and I 'dont know how would it be on live chart. But it is good approximation.

Tommorow plan to retest it again but with :

1 - proper counting of HHHL LHLL (you can't call HL till previous HH is broken and reverse)

2 - the method you have presented on page 27

3 - Ichimoku with your settings

Can't wait till I get those data but now tired.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Hi JT

Have been reading your thread today, and have downloaded some indis etc. I will try out it for the next few weeks or so.

You seem to have a flare for scalping, not just using renko, but reading price action in general. Subscribed

Cheers

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Looking forward to results, even 28% which was the low end is a good rate of return. My biggest issue is cutting my self to short on trades. But the US 8-12 is the toughest trading period in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Just finished testing the method from page 27 and 5 pip bricks. Wow - 369 trades 265 negative pips. Looked at it also using 10 pip bricks looks much better as this size makes possible to catch 100 pip runners but august would not be tradeable so couldn't really test it.

Also tested 10 pip bricks with ichimoku (2,6,13). Trying to be as objective as possible so choosen to take only breakouts and bounces of Kumo and the first brick opened around Frankfurt Open but not farther than 2 bricks away from Kumo.

2 options:

1- SL 20, TP 40 - 140 pips, 14% up

2- SL 20, and then trailing by 3 brick swings - 442 pips, 44% up.

Looks promising so will test it on 5 pip bricks but not today as I'm fed up.

Just finished test on 5 pip renko EURJPY, ichimoku JTee1 settings, trades only when price breakouts or bounces of kumo. Period 10 august till today 2% risk. And 2 options:

1- Fixed SL 15, TP 30 - 540 pips and 72%

2- SL 15 and then trailing by 3 brick swings - 595 pips and 79%

Personally prefer option 1 - set it and go living.

For now kumo with 5pip renko seems the best - nice outcome and objective entries - good for trader who doesn't have enough screenhours. JTee1 proves post by post that experience is the most important thing. Making those tests I'm pumping my own screenhours.

Now test with proper counting of HHHL LHLL is to be done.

Edit : I missed here at least 2 entries and the last one is a brick too late.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
All good entries with some good runners. I like the long term ichi on chart also, those are the ones that I will let run and loosen stop to prior highs and lows and then tighten as US session gets close. TY for the markup

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
I will consider it. Just have to experiment with color scheme to see price well see clean suggestions from ichimoku and not burn my eyes. I spend too many hours with charts so it is important factor.

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Just finished testing EURJPY 11 august till today on 5 pip bricks using proper counting of HHHL LHLL - taking trades only in the direction of current count.

2 options of management:

1 - SL 15 TP 30 : 315 pips

2 - SL 15 and then trailing by 3 brick swings : 100 pips

The runners in trailing method were surprisingly rare losers more often though deceivingly acceptable for psyche as losing streaks were shorter (fixed SL TP method given longest streak of 8 losers, 4-5 were numerous)

So of all tests there are 2 winners - reading immediate left price action and breakout/bounce of kumo with fixed SL TP.

Hmm when I look at my own conclusion - how about taking only breakouts/bounces of kumo supported by immediate left price action? This could even change outcome of different methods of thade management.

Thanks friend.

Keep it up !

M3 is 1 pip with 5 pip shade box so I can scalp inside the trend.   London trade I put 15 pip sl and BE at 10 pips no trailer. US session  BE was 5 pips TS 10 pips but took profit to early in US session and to early on most trades.
