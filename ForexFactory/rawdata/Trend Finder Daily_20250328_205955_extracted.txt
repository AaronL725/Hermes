What pair do you trade using this system? Seems like a pretty powerful system. If you are trading this system live, what's your win/loss ratio and how many pips are you getting on an average?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Isn't "Stochastic Histogram" just Stochastic crossing the 50 line?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hello, I trade this system on all available pairs. The win rate after 4 months of demo trading is 82% The win rate after 2 months of live trading is 84% The average amount of pips earned for the second trade. (The one that runs until there is a reversal) is 215 pips. However, i've had trades go as high as 600+ pips, as well as the second trade going back to break even for 0 additional pips. The first trade either goes to -100, 0, or +100. Bull101

--- 帖子 #5 ---
That is correct. When the histogram changes to green, that is the same as the regular stochastic's main line going over the 50 line. The reason I use this indicator is because I find it easier to read, and I believe it will lower the amount of confusion for newer traders. Bull101

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi, your system looks very similar to ozfx...... might work fairly well just like his. thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #7 ---
That is true, a friend of mine had mentioned that to me. After reading over his system it appears that the main, if only real difference, is that I use the Awesome Oscillator as opposed to the Accelerator Oscillator. AO is usually slower compared to AC, however I find that it is MUCH more reliable than AC. My system also uses the stoch histogram, but that is the exact same as the standard stochastic indicator, it just displays it differently. Bull101

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks for using the histogram. You are right, it's easier for new traders like myself. I'm going to start demo trading this system tonight when I get home from work. I love how this system is simple and very easy to understand. Do you recommend a broker to use for the charting? For instance, some brokers create daily candles at different times. If you could let us know what broker you use for your decision making, it will help with getting as close to your results as possible.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hello, I have been finding these signals using ODL. Their daily candle opens at 0:00GMT, so any broker that opens at that time, you should be fine with. My live broker is FXCM , however, I haven't switched to their MT4 account yet. So I find entries with ODL, trade live with FXCM. Hope that answers your question, Bull101

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thanks for such a quick response. I will open a demo with ODL tonight. My live account is also with FXCM so I will be using ODL for my charts and FXCM for live trading this system (when that time comes after demoing first).

--- 帖子 #11 ---
So with the daily setup you do wait for the candle close correct? What pairs do you trade? Do you the same take profit and stop loss setting for all pairs?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hello, I do not wait for the candle to close. I analyze the charts when the candle opens. If there is a signal, I take it. I trade this on all available pairs.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Looks like a short signal on both GBP/USD &amp; EUR/USD. Please take a look at the chart to confirm.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
How long will you analyze this? Does the color change back and forth? My trades are based on candle close with both indicators agreeing (same color) so I guess this is incorrect.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Since the AO changed on the last candle, I consider entering now to be a late entry, so I would not take these trades.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Whenever I finish analyzing them at the candle open. So I would say roughly 10 minutes at the most.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
This may be a stupid question but I'm new to mt4 and stuff like that. How do I get the templet to my odl platform?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Place the .tpl file in C:\program files\ODL MetaTrader 4\templates Then restart mt4, right click on your chart, go to templates, and select the template. Bull101

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Forgot to mention you'll also need to place the indicator files in c:\program files\odl meta trader 4\experts\indicators

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Bull, thanks for sharing ur system with us. my question is.... i) based on ur 1st post, both indicators are showing same color(either green or red). at some point it's still showing red color whereas the trend go reverse. i mean the market in bull market. ii) and some time when indicators are both green; the market get to reverse. therefore how do you determine the market and enter ur trade??? i hope u will answer my Q. thanks

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hello, When the indicators both change to green, that is a buy entry. They will usually not change at the exact same time. It does not matter which one goes first. You exit the second trade when AO shows a reverse signal. However, it is true, that sometimes when the indicators line up, everything looks perfect, you enter the trade, and the market goes in the other direction. There is no way to predict the market 100% of the time. This is however very accurate, but of course, not 100% of the time. I hope that answers your questions, if it doesn't, please don't hesitate to ask some more Bull101

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Bull, i really appreciate for your help and time spend for this. i just discover that it is better to place a trade when the 1st line of both indicators are showing same color. in mid of the of the indicators, we have to judge based on the stochastic. if the indicators and stochastics are in different direction then we have to judge on our own. the summary::::enter when the 1st line of both indicators are same in color

--- 帖子 #24 ---
maybe someone try to do EA for this... BTW, anyone could teach me how write EA...i really appreciate that...

--- 帖子 #25 ---
This is for Bull101. I have a question about a trade. I did not take the trade because it's from a few days ago but I'm wondering if you can help me out. The problem is, I got a message saying it's too large to add to my post. Is there a way I can pm you or send you an email? I was notified that you don't accept emails, so how can I get in contact with you so you can see my chart?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Sure, I just switched on accept emails, however, you could upload your chart image to http://www.imageshack.us then post a link here so everyone will be able to see it in case they run into the same problem that you're having. Bull101

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I tried that link and have no clue what I'm doing. I'm going to send you an email.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I've sent the email to you.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks Bull101 for sharing this system I think the next thing that we should work on is to find out the most suitable SL and TP for each pairs.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Letting you know I replied to your email

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I agree, although -100, +50, +100 does work rather well, customized SL and TP would be even better. I'm trying to find a good way to share my future trade results. I have seen some doing it with google docs, I am going to look into that some more. Maybe after a couple months, we'll have have decent averages for several pairs, and begin customizing the SL's.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Bull101... thks for sharing your system. I just see your system, Anyway i have a few Q 1. Is AO Indicator changing value during the day? 2. Is Stoch_Histogram I ndicator changing its value far away from open value during the day? (I know its changing by time rapidly). Is it possible for histogram to change its colour before end of day? Thks again

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hello, Yes to both Questions. Both indicators can change color at anytime before the bar closes. However, if you try and play it safe by waiting for the bar to close before entering, you will find that you are getting into trades much later than you could be. It does happen. You will enter the perfect trade, and suddenly the market goes the other way, and the indicators change. However, as the system states, no matter what happens, after you open your trade, you hold it open no matter what the indicators close as. This is also the reason that back testing can be deceiving with this system. I am planning on starting to post up some trade results as they happen so everyone can follow along with the system. Hopefully this will clear up many questions and expand everyone's knowledge of how the system works. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yes, i agree with you about backtesting can't represent precisely how good this system is. Nice idea to post forwardtesting here, might be someone could find the best tune for your system. Thks again Bull

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I think you posting some of your trades would clear up a lot of things. I don't think you need to post every trade you take because we need to learn how to spot the trades ourselves but a few post when you open a trade here and there can show how profitable this system is and it can clear up some questions.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Bull thanks for putting the systerm up. How and when do you move to B/E are you watching the charts through the day or do you have some EA to move to break even. With Thanks David

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hello David, I usually set an alert in MT4 to alert a sound when the pair makes it to the break even point. However, if I know im going to be away from my computer, I setup an email alert that goes out to my cellphone, then with fxcm , I can call in and have them move my stop loss.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Do anyone know what is black line in the Stoch_Histogram indicator? Is it useful? if it is not may be someone could help to remove it.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
like i said in ur other thread we can use fibonacci as our probable profit targets and add sars and heiken ashi to d chart,wat do u tink

--- 帖子 #40 ---
pls are u trading fxcm metatrader live?how has it being are they good brokers,pls help

--- 帖子 #41 ---
No matter when both are green or red, you will always enter the following day, am I correct? So there would never be a need to watch when to get in on a position during the day, you would just check start of day every day.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
See Post # 12 Hello, I do not wait for the candle to close. I analyze the charts when the candle opens. If there is a signal, I take it. I trade this on all available pairs. Ignored http://forexfactory.com/images/buttons/quote.gif

--- 帖子 #43 ---
hi, bull101, how many trades can you make every month on average for this daily strategy? and how many trades for the 4h strategy?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I am backtesting this strategy, for example, at the beginning of jan 14 2008, both bar were green, so I bought at 1.2779. and set a stop loss at 1.2677. then during the day, both bar suddenly turned to red (so weird), and hit my stop loss at 1.2677.... that means, this one is a failed trade. am I right? please see the attached pictures! btw, I use the every tick model and visual mode in the strategy tester to backtest (using my eyes ). (of course, first we need to download the 1m data(1999 - 2008) from the metatrader "tools-history center" to make the every tick model test. I hope you know this.)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
and I noticed a weird thing... At the very beginning of the day(01 14 2008), the stoch histogram is a half green half red bar.(the upper is green, the lower is red)...In this case, we can't trade, right? is this a regular one?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
www.metatrader.info/node/34 The indicator is programmed so that when the stoch is above or equal to 50, the line is green, and when the indicator is below or equal to 50, the line is red. That there is a value of 50. As for the rest of you: attached is an EA for this system.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I have noticed that and think it is a "bug" of the indicator, as if I change timeframes and come back, it shows only one color.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
A really nice , simple system , I'll get trialling it. Many thanks to Bull for the system, and thanks to Ronald for again sharing his programming skills with the FF people and making an EA. Cal

--- 帖子 #49 ---
OK, I have saved the EA everywhere, dragged it to the chart and the symbol is now sitting on the top right hand corner of the chart, with an x next to it. I've allowed live trade, I've set lot size to 1.0, but still the x is there. This is only my 2nd time working with EA, each as demo obviously, and have not been successful. RR where am I going wrong?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Look at the toolbar at the top of your metatrader screen. Make sure the expert advisor button is green. Otherwise, it won't trade.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I'm now standing in the corner wearing my newbie hat. Thank you so much, now back to making money.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hi, ronald, Are you sure there is nothing wrong with your EA? it looks like a so "great" strategy.... we can use it as inverse indicators.... look at this backtest result:

--- 帖子 #53 ---
is this really a bug or not? I hope it's not, it's just a special bar indicates not to trade .

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Strategy tester doesnt usually reflect real market conditions very well. Ronald is an excellent programmer who has simply coded the rules as presented. The EA needs some forward testing before any of us can really comment on it's performance. If the EA is compiled, added to daily charts and you don't see any errors in operation, then feel lucky that Ronald spent his time to make an EA that was freely posted for all to try. Just give it a chance in forward testing for a few weeks- you can't really judge a daily bar strategy until you've trialled it for a Month as a bare minimum in my humble opinion

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I'm curious. What is your modelling quality? Did the EA follow the entry rules?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I'm curious to see if anybody has entered any trades using this system and if so, what are your results?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Bull101: This is a 2-PART QUESTION: So you've got two versions now on ForexFactory, the 4h and Daily TF approach. From a psychology standpoint, I think I like the 4h version better because it provides some degree of instant gratification and probably the drawdowns when you in the middle of a trade are less. But ultimately what matters most is...which one is going to make you the most money and with the least of amount risk? Unless I've missed it, I'm surprised that no one has asked you that question yet. So which method makes you more money...the 4h or Daily version? 2. I very appreciate your sharing this system. I am amazed at how simple systems often become weighed down with layers of complex nuances. Phillip Nel's 4h systems is great, but it seems to have a steep learning curve when you look at all the different patterns and interpretation you have learn. I also think that OzFX and Fozzy are also great. But both have evolved in that direction as well. They appear to be simple systems, but it doesn't appear to work well if you apply them mechanically. Granted, I don't think success in Forex trading comes on a silver platter. I know there is inherently a great deal of thought-process in money management and executing trades. Nevertheless, I like the simplicity of your methods and I hope they stay that way. Given the way that you have applied your 4H and Daily Methods in your real account, are you able to more or less apply them mechanically...just following simple rules?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I took 2 trades last night on a closed candle with all indicators agreeing, however, this is not by the rules. You would need to monitor the daily open to see if both indicators change color according to the author of thread.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
What was your reasoning for waiting for the close of the daily candle rather than entering on the open? Can the Stochs and AO bar change colors before the new daily candle is formed? I thought those indicators did not repaint. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Did the two trades you take turn a profit for you?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Repainting is defined as an indicator whose value for a specifc bar changes after the aforementioned bar has closed. During a candle, the indicator's value for that candle will always chance as the price changes. After the price stops changing, the indicator's value should also stop changing, if that doesn't happen, you have repainting.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thank you for clearing that up for me. You broke that down well enough for a newbie like me to totally understand exactly what you are saying.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
This is correct, you would not be able to trade at this time.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
The black line just goes over the top of the indicator. I do not find it useful. You can remove it by going into options, and selecting its color to "None"

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I have never had a problem with FXCM . However, I have not yet tested this MT4 platform. I do not want to transfer my live account to their MT4 without testing it, but unfortunately they are not offering demo accounts yet. Hopefully another couple of months and they will be offering MT4 Demo accounts.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
That is a possibility, I will look into using that. Thanks for the suggestion

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks again for your work Ronald

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I agree with this. I have also found that back testing EA's is usually not very accurate.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hello, To your first question, the Daily Strategy has produced more money. The main reason is because the 4hr strategy will produce more losses and smaller gains than the daily system. Although you will have more trades, there will be more losses than the Daily. To your second, I apply both systems 100% mechanically. I don't believe in analyzing anything else when i'm using a certain system. Stick to the rules 100% of the time, and it will pay off in the end. I hope that answers your question, let me know if I didn't. Bull101

--- 帖子 #70 ---
it's working, thks.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Just one question: The below is just an example... WEDNESDAY: STOCHASTIC BAR CLOSES AT RED , aWSOME OSCIALLTOR BAR CLOSES ON GREEN. QUEST 1: ON THURSDAY IF BOTH BAR OPEN AT GREEN, I SHOULD GO LONG. RIGHT?? QUEST 2: IF THEY OPEN DIFFERENT COLOURS BUT DURING THE DAY THEY BOTH TURN GREEN, SHOULD I STILL GO LONG?? QUEST 3: IF THEY TURN GREEN DURING THE DAY AND I ENTER LONG, BUT BY THE TIME THE CANDLE CLOSES, THEY BOTH TURN RED OR GREEN AND RED. SHOULD I STILL STAY IN TRADE??? QUEST 4: IF I AM IN LONG TRADE, YOU MENTION IF YOU GET REVERSAL SINGAL, CLOSE THE TRADE. REVERSAL SIGNAL MEANS THE BAR CLOSES THEN OR WHEN THE BAR CHANGES THE COLOUR DURING THE DAY. CAUSE DURING THE DAY THE STOC AND A.O WILL KEEP CHANGING THE COLOUR UNTIL THEY CLOSED. i HOPE BULL101 CAN REPLY TO THIS PERSONALLY.... QUESTION BY QUESTION?? THANKS FOR CLARIFICATION...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Yes you would go long in this situation. No, if they are not both the same color at the opening of the candle, I do not take the trade. I analyze the charts for maybe 10 minutes after the opening of the candle. If there is no entry signal at that time, I wait for the next day. You should hold all trades open until you have gotten to at least +50 and have set a break even. You are to hold all trades until you reach the break even point, and ignore reverse signals until you are at least at break even. If I missed anything, let me know. Bull101

--- 帖子 #73 ---
thanks for sharing your very nice system. awaiting some "signals" from you so we can learn to trade this system like you do. looking forward to testing it.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Sounds good, i'll begin posting entry signals this week starting at 0:00GMT Monday.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Entry Signals No good signals today

--- 帖子 #76 ---
The signal doesn't appear alot in a year, so i think we won't see it so soon. Anyway, which pairs do you use?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
EURCHF had a signal today. (Not taking sunday candle into account). Shows as well on the 4H trend system. Maybe not too late for an entry... as 4H candle just started 5 minutes ago. Entry price on Daily would have been around 1.6100.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
When pairs are moving with their trends, it will produce about 3-4 signals a week. There are down times when pairs are retracting though. I trade this system on all available pairs. Bull101

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hello, This would be a signal if you ignore the Sunday candle. Personally, I do not trade the Sunday candle. I do now consider this to be a late entry.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
personally i prefer trade everyday

--- 帖子 #81 ---
wow great system... just wanto to try the h4 first. hope it works with me

--- 帖子 #82 ---
the 12th of june would have been a good day to place a trade on eurusd. i still see potential for this and am shorting(late entry) Bull101 what is your stance regarding late entries ?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Looks like the last signal on EUR USD was the 13th. Shorting now would most definitely be a late entry. I never take late entries. The way I see it, there is always going to be more signals, there is no reason to try and catch every move. And when I put my money on the line, I want to have the best odds possible. Taking late entries will not give me the best odds possible. Hope that clears it up, Bull101

--- 帖子 #84 ---
you are right. still got some newbeness in me lol never break the rules of the system

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I'm glad that your released your system. I have wanted to focus on the Daily TF for some time and for a while I studied OzFX. But I was uncomfortable with the win/loss ratio. It seemed streaky. That's not to knock OzFX. It seems to work for many people, but my concern is what happens if you start trading it while it's in the midst of a losing streak. That having been said, it's intriguing you were able to identify such a big difference in performance simply by using AO instead of what OzFX uses which is AC. I did some research and one of the things I've read is that both AO and AC are variations on MACD. Do have any comments on the process by which you decided to use AO? And for that matter, did you play around with other indicators?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hello, AO is slower than AC, however it is much more reliable for good entries. AO uses a longer period, and is able to determine an actual change in direction much better than AC. It is true that they are both moving averages, similar to MACD. I have played around with other indicators, however, I have found that adding anything else will cause late entries, and missed entries. There are of course losing trades using stoch and AO only, but the win ratio is much greater than the loss rate. Also, using only these two indicators will generate more signals. I hope that clears it up, if it doesn't, let me know. Bull101

--- 帖子 #87 ---
i think nzdchf is on the verge of making a signal. watch out for this pair

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Daily Signals: Three signals today. GBP/USD: Buy at 1.9633 NZD/USD: Buy at .7535 NZD/CHF: Buy at .7875

--- 帖子 #89 ---
how about nzdchf ? signal seems to have been triggered.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
NZD/CHF is a valid long entry signal. Forgot to check that pair since my live broker doesn't offer it. I'll begin posting signals for all pairs that ODL offers for now on. I have added this pair to the above post.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
we should also begin tracking results beginning from this week it would be nice Bull101 if you could post weekly results of the system in the first post along with the system rules

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I will be tracking trade results in a spread sheet. I'll try and come up with the best way of displaying them for everyone.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
USD/CAD? I took this long as well. Mistake?????

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hello jcorp, Thanks for bringing this up. I will only take an entry signal after there has been a complete reversal signal. So in order for me to go long on USD/CAD again, there must be a complete short entry signal first. Let me know if that doesn't clear this up, Bull101

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Tracking Results... The following link will provide trade results, i'll program in a statistics sheet after we have some results down. http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?k...=0&amp;single=true

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Crystal Clear....Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
what do you understand by complete reversal signal ?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I see a valid entry for the GBP/USD but not for the NZD/USD? Yes the Stoch Histogram changed to green but since the previous bar for AO was( on the 16th) already green there arent any changes.. What am i missing?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
In the example of USD/CAD, there has not yet been a complete short signal. Only after there has been a short signal displayed, will I take another long entry. This helps ensure that we are getting the best entries possible.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hello, The indicators do not need to change at the same time to be a valid entry. Bull101

--- 帖子 #101 ---
A complete reversal signal (as in this case, USDCAD) would have been a short signal completed (not only a red bar on the AO yesterday) with due follow-up. Yesterday's red bar is like a "bump" in the uptrend continuation but the long entry signal was (on my chart) on may 26 so that would be a very very late entry, as per the system rules. P.S. In fact: besides being a "no-trade" condition, the fact that yesterday's bar is a red one and that today's stoch histogram is much LOWER, could give a hint of a possible short reversal so would be quite risky to just assume that if the day began with a green bar it's long again...

--- 帖子 #102 ---
This is 100% correct. Thanks for explaining that for everyone.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
http://i236.photobucket.com/albums/f...ihan/nzdss.gif Ok i am confused here.When you say" Ac or St.H." has changed to green" means their previous bars was red right? But when you say they dont have to change at the same time makes it hard to understand...Can you clarify please?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
What I believe he means is they don't have to change and match on the same day. For instance, let's say on Monday EUR/USD creates a red AC candle at the open of the daily candle but Stochs creates a green candle, that is not a valid trade. Once stochs turns red, as long as AC is still red, that's a valid entry short. Keep in mind though, in order to have a valid entry short, the last valid signal for that pair must have been a long entry. So if the last valid signal on EUR/USD was a short trade, and you missed it, you would not want to take another short trade on EUR/USD until there has been a valid long entry first. So for example: Monday: EUR/USD valid short entry (AC=Red &amp; Stochs=Red) (You missed this trade because you were out shopping or something) Tuesday: EUR/USD another valid short entry (AC=Red &amp; Stochs=Red) You would not take this trade because that is a late entry because the last valid entry on EUR/USD was short, which generated the previous day. To sum it up, if I'm understanding the rules correctly, you will never have two short trades in a row on the same pair and you will never have two long trades in a row on the same pair. In order for your signals to be valid, if I'm understanding the rules correctly, after a valid short trade, they must be a valid long trade before you can go short in that currency pair again. After a valid long trade, there must be a valid short trade before you can go long again in that currency pair. Hopefully this clears things up for you. Hopefully Bull101 will read my response and clear anything up if need be. Also, Bull101, if I offended you by answering a question that has to do with your system, I'm sorry and mean no disrespect. I figured I would try and answer the question to help others as I have been helped in the past. If my answer to the question was incorrect, I'm truly sorry for that. I believe I have a pretty solid understanding of the system as the rules have been stated thus far, so I wanted to try and help a fellow trader.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Dl's response answers your question perfectly. If you need more clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. Bull101

--- 帖子 #106 ---
This is 100% correct. Thanks for answering Dl Bull101

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Trade Updates: GBP/USD Reached +50 and a break even stop loss was set that was later hit. +0 for GBP/USD. NZD/USD is Still Open, currently at +25, stop loss still at -100. NZD/CHF is still open, currently at -2, stop loss still at -100. Bull101

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I just wanted to say that I believe this system has great potential and in just a few days of this thread being open Bull101 has been so generous and kind to all of us. He has answered every single question I have asked and it a very quick manner. I think with the results we are seeing from the 3 calls from yesterday, this system has great potential. It's nice to be part of a thread like this one!

Bull, Impressive looking system so easy I could do it LOL. Thanks

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I have a quick question for Bull101. We are to never risk more than 3% of our available balance at one time, which I think is a great idea. Let's say for instance that we get 6 signals in one day but ones capital is not enough to trade all 6 and still risk only 3% of our capital. Is there a method that you use to decide which trades may be the most profitable or in a situation like that, is it best to just pick the pairs we are most comfortable with out of the 6 signals? I know some people have the opportunity to trade nano lots where each pip may be $0.10 or something like that but my live account is with FXCM so I don't have that option as a mini lot is the smallest lot possible. Of course this question is more for future reference as are just beginning this system so it's strictly demo trading now.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I have kind of the same problem, an I've traded with FXCM for a few years (not very well I might add LOL) A big part of the problem is money Management for me because like you I do not have 10000 dollars in my pocket to properly fund a mini account. We end up with way too much of our money on the table and instead of a drawdown we're wiped out (sound Familiar?) I just punted, I'm currently running a demo on interbankfx and will open a micro account with like $500 in a couple of weeks when I have mastered the system and TF I want to trade. Because until I find a system i can trade with consistant profits, using more than a weekends beer money is crazy. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #112 ---
It sure sounds like we fell from the same tree! That's exactly what my problem is. I'm looking to start with $500 also. Granted I know that is not much and many people may laugh but that's the best I can do right now. I can't give up on my dream of trading forex for a living one day though and I know I must start somewhere. I'm not too concerned with making a lot of money right now. I know my capital ($500) will not allow that to happen. I've been working my current full time job since I graduated from high school (I'm currently 25) so I'm not in no rush to try and trade for a living next month or anything like that. I know it's gonna take time due to m lack of funds. Maybe Bull101 can outline an example of a money management plan for the traders like myself who are "capital stricken"!. Maybe something like, for every $2,000 you have in capital, you trade one mini lot or something like that. That way as your capital increases, we can increase our lot size. Our stop loss and profit targets or rules of the system would not change but we could slowly build our capital that way. Like for me, since this is a daily system, I'm not sure what amount of capital is enough to be trading a mini lot. So, if Bull101 can give an example, it does not have to be very detailed because I know that is very timely, I'm sure that would help the young traders like myself or the ones, who like myself, don't have thousands to put in an account and start trading with. Any help, from anybody, not just Bull101, would be greatly appreciated. Jimbop is correct with everything he said. Our capital is so small that rather than have a drawdown, we get wiped out and have to exit before we get a margin call or something like that.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I really think you should try a Micro account, The rules all work the same, you just don't win or lose quite as much.... Like you said you're 25 you have PLENTY of time to build that up (BTW I think me and everyone else here who isnt already would like to be full time successful traders LOL) I'm 41 I have money but my wife wont let me spend alot LMFAO!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hey, I'm going to PM you Jimbop so we don't take up space on the the thread for the system.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hello, This situation does not happen very often, but when it does happen, I will take the pairs that have the next highest support or resistance level the farthest away. The reason for that is because I believe it will be easier to get to +100 when the next point where it may have a reversal is furthest away. Let me know if I need to clarify that, Bull101

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Truth is that you can pretty much start with any amount of money. Just as long as your with a broker that will let you trade small enough to only risk 3%, you'll be fine. The system will always be positive over the long run, and your balance will build, slowly increasing that 3%. Just as long as you are not ever risking more than 3% of your balance, any starting amount of capital will produce positive results. Bull101

--- 帖子 #117 ---
This may be a viable option for many starting with smaller amounts of capital. Your balances will build, and you will increase what that 3% makes over time. Bull101

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Feel free to put your questions out to the public if your comfortable doing that. The more questions being answered to the public, the more everyone benefits Bull101

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I have heard some say that FXCM might be allowing micro accounts soon, but don't quote me on that. Bull101

--- 帖子 #120 ---
That would be a good thing if they did that. I would then not have to worry about opening another live account. Hopefully they will do that by the time I go live. Thanks for all the answers Bull101. It's good to know that any amount of money is good enough to start with this system. A micro lot is best for people with small capital because 3% on a $500 mini account is 15 pips and that's not even enough to cover the 100 pip stop loss. To all the people posting on this thread, lets make this the best thread and system out there. Bull101 was generous enough to share his system with us and he is working with us all. Let's not see those efforts of his not get noticed! 1 hour before we see if we have any new signals for today!!!

If you use an MA set at 1MA LWMA Median and a 1MA SHIFT 1 LWMA Median you create a shadow of price movement and enter at the cross. Gives you a very definite entry point with this system without getting in too late. The entry and exits are much better defined.

I'll have to take a look at that, thanks for the input! Bull101

--- 帖子 #127 ---
GBP/USD was a signal yesterday. We had our break even stop loss hit. I would consider entering now to be a late entry to yesterdays trade, and would not take this trade. Thanks! Bull101

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hey Bull, Good solid system!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
sweeet... awesome bro

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Ok I thought I would add a piece to your system. When the 1MA, step 1, LWMA, Median (the blue line) is crossed by price plus the spread of the currency it will send a warning sound plus post on your screen a message and put an arrow on your chart. This is just a warning device to let you know a possible trade is coming up. You can then look at your other indicators to check to see if you want to make a trade. Since this is basically a Price plus pip spread crossing a 1 MA shifted 1, you will occasionally get some false signals but it will catch the change of directions for you. I posted a pic and the indicator. I have not tried trading with this yet but I will try it out today. The indicator will ding when you change currencies at times. That does not mean there is a fresh signal but it will give you the last signal of that currency pair. Part of the warning device. Good luck with it and I hope it helps. The white dotted line separates the months so for the month of May it gave you 5 buy signals and 3 sell signals. For June you have 2 of each. This is the Eur/USD Daily chart. The yellow line on the screen is the 1MA Median with no shift. I call this shadow trading where when price crosses its own shadow it signifies a possible change of direction.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Bull101, in the entry &amp; money management section of the system, you say to put a stop loss of 100 pips, but then, when the trades reach +50 pips you say to move stop loss to break even, which would mean a stop loss of 50 pips, not 100. why ?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
That's a standard practice in trading. If the trade moves in your favor by 50 pips, it's a safe bet it will continue in your direction. With the odds in your favor, it makes sense to protect the remainder of your account by moving the SL to break even.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
i agree, but considering that the timeframe is daily, wouldn't 100 pips s/l be more ok ? because i have found many instances where price moved 50 pips in your favor, then retraced 70 pips for example, but in the end continued in your direction

--- 帖子 #134 ---
You're right. Probably the best answer is 50 pips is generous on the daily for some pairs, and way too small for others. Same might be said for 100 pip targets and stoplosses.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I agree, AO is definitely more reliable than AC. I personally use both in my trading for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
If the capital you have doesn't suit this system, I suggest you put this system on the backburner, and take up scalping, or news straddling, because inadequate capital is a good cause of many failures.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Ron, I think any type of trading method is unsuitable if one doesn't have a sufficient amount of capital.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
That begs the question then: What kind of trading system requires little capital? Scalping comes to mind =D

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Ron and Ash, 500 in a mini account is not nearly enough you are both correct. (I have personally proved that to myself many times LOL) 5k would be as low as I would consider starting a mini with now. 500 in a micro would be sufficient as each pip on your trade is only 10 cents, you 100 pip sl gets hit for 10 dollars=2% of your account=pretty much right where you want to be with your MM. By the way I've enjoyed both of you posts immensly around this forum...Ash I've been to your site very nice, Ron your brilliant I wish I started at 17 !

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hey guys just a silly question. Is a 4h TF not reasonable?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Bull, first of all let me thank you for all your efforts and marvelous and simple system. I like it a lot, specially because its daily also. One query please if you could help me out, from the charts you see, is the discrepancy in the dates you mention because as I understand it I cant see any buys as per the system. Any help understanding this would be much appreciated. thanks

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi, I have no idea what you are talking about, can you tell me how to put these items on a chart please Paul

--- 帖子 #143 ---
MA = Moving Average (Menu &gt; Insert &gt; Indicators &gt; Trend &gt; Moving Average) 1 MA LWMA Median = Moving Average; Period: 1; MA Method: Linear Weighted; Applied to: Median Price (HL/2) 1 MA LWMA Median Shift 1 = same as above, Shift: 1 (the above, on Metatrader 4).

--- 帖子 #144 ---
This can, and does happen. However, I would rather play it safe and protect myself from a loss in these situations. Bull101

--- 帖子 #145 ---
This is true. After a couple more months of trading, hopefully we'll start being able to come up with some customized SL's and TP's. Bull101

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Here's a quick question for B101: Do you have some sort of indicator alert that rings when the criteria is met? It seems that legitimate signals (all green) sometimes appear and then disappear as the market pulls back slightly. Last night most of the signals on the Google Doc you did not show up an official signal in my platform (FXDD). That led me to believe that you noticed a signal, took your entry and then a slight pullback occurred which made one of the greens turn red. Is there a way for a person who isn't watching the market continually to avoid that type of situation?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hello Major, I do not use any alerts for entry criteria. This is true that they can change throughout the day, however, as far as I could tell, they didn't change back and forth yesterday. I believe the problem may be that you are following along with FXDD. I recommend opening a demo account with ODL so that you will be seeing exactly what I am seeing. Bull101

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I prefer the Daily, all technical analysis holds true more often on the daily charts. It also catches bigger, longer moves. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hello, Please ensure you are using an ODL account so you can follow along correctly. Here is the entry to GBPUSD.(attached below) The Stochastic bar is very low, however it is still green when the original entry was called.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Thanks Man, Now i understand it

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Thank you very much for the clarification. I had the impression that different brokers would have caused these differences. I appreciate your help. Like you I trade with FXCM and am one of the first ones to start trading with the Metatrader platform, plenty of glitches in the beginning but seems that they have sorted them out, for the past couple of weeks the platform seems steady now. The main problem was that trades used to get closed without hitting any stops and without any input at all, but they seem to have resolved the issue now, the last one that happened to me was over a week ago. I will get the ODL demo account and use their TF and then trade on the FXCM metatrader. One thing is for sure, different traders do show sometimes different candle patterns. Thanks again for your help. xrunner

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I ran this by B101 in a PM chat that I had with him. I know it's still very early with using his system but maybe on the second lot, using a 50 pip trailing stop might work pretty good. B101 has said that he has seen the second lot be up 215 pips sometimes (or even more) and then retrace all the way back to get stopped out at break even. Now I know all of us would love to lock in 150 pips out of 215 rather than seeing it get stopped out for 0 pips. This is just something I wanted to share and throw out there to see what others think. Yes, by doing this, you can get stopped out prematurely but I would rather take 150 pips off the table than to walk away with 0, even if I could have had 250 pips, but that's just me. I'm sure everybody has their own opinions about this topic.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
hi bull, really appreciate u sharing this here... when i first looked at it, that was yesterday... i instantly liked it its some kind of easy on the eyes with the indicators... i myself was working on a very different trading approach the last few weeks... but now that i realised some weakness in my own setup... and so i decided to take a break from optimizing my system and spending hours on searching brackets in mql4 i like what ur idea very much. setup is nice... definately there can be some future variations with sl, or ts instead... but for now i will take the few minutes everyday arround midnight to check for the new candle and give u some feedback on what is happening. so... as i got my new candles almost 2 hours ago... i went long on eurusd @ 1.5537 long on audusd @ 0.9473 short on usdchf @ 1.0460 and short on euraud @ 1.6400 so far... AUD is really bad moving against me... but maybe i should just relax, not give it any attention and wait for tomorrow... what is kinda challenge for me since im usually trading very short timeframes... would be great to check if u took the same trades... will see u later, Cash

--- 帖子 #156 ---
E/U hit +50 pips so make sure you remembered to move your stoploss to break even. Anybody open any new trades today?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I opened these trades today.Can anyone confirm? Short on Usd/Chf Short on Gpb/Jpy Short on Usd/Jpy anyone else??

--- 帖子 #158 ---
short USD/CHF short USD/JPY short GBP/JPY short GBP/CHF short EUR/CHF long CHF/JPY short AUD/CAD

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Looks like you really are looking at some good trades. Seems like this system is one that will have many trades open at one time. We still are in all of our trades from yesterday. Waiting to see if B101 is going to post any trades he took??

--- 帖子 #160 ---
hi di1982, no worry bout SL... using inital SL of 100... and for later on TS 50... we'll see if it brings different results... interesting system... lots of open trades...

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I think a trailing stop of 50 pips will do wonders for the second lot by locking in some pips. Let us know what the trailing stop of 50 pips does for your results.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Took all those myself, except AUD/CAD....according to this system, they all look like good trades. Good pipping luck to us all!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hello everyone, sorry about having no signals today. Someone ran into a power line on our road and I couldn't get online until now. I'm going to post what trades I would have taken in a few minutes.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
GBP/JPY Short GBP/CHF Short AUD/CAD Short USD/CHF Short USD/JPY Short EUR/CHF Short I am going to manually track these as if I had entered at the open of the candle for statistics purposes. Also, EUR/USD has reached +50, so there is now a break even stop loss for both trades.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Will be answering questions in a few moments, gotta get my clocks reset

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hello, The reason I did not long CHF/JPY is because there has not yet been a reverse signal since the last long.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Quick question for Ron, the EA Meister.... Bull101 has stated that he will take a trade if one appears within the first 10 minutes of the new day's bar. Does your EA do that? or will it take a trade anytime during the day a valid signal appears? thanks....

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Goodmorning everyone, I know most of you are still just crossing the midnight zone, over here its already sunny and bright, I am in the UK, Just wanted to make sure if this chart shows a signal xrunner

Hi BUll Its quite come great system you have out together here, i really like its simplicity. I have though been using the EA but i want to understand the system manually. My broker's ( FXPRO ) time is GMT+3, what time shoulg i then look up the chart to setup my trades. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hello xrunner, You are 100% correct. That is a short entry signal. Thanks! Bull101

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hello ventis, Thank you for your compliments. To ensure that you are able to follow along correctly, I recommend you open a demo account with ODL. Their daily bar opens at 0:00 GMT. That is where I find my entry signals, and then pass them to my live account. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #172 ---
thanks for your prompt reply. how does this strategy perform during any major news as it affects the cuurency pair in question? I hope you get my question right. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
http://img205.imageshack.us/my.php?image=gbpusdou5.gif i want to draw your attention on this. as you can see there was a signal where the red thumbs up is. however, before moving further upward with the trend, it went down 100 pips, thus you would have been stopped out. what do you do in situations like this, where you get stopped out in the very beginning, but afterwards the trend goes your way ?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
In this case you were so close to staying in, it was probably the difference in the spread that knocked you out. Its amazing how often a 100 pip stop will get hit but the trade comes back and is a winner. Some options are: accept this as the nature of the beast, sometimes it happens and look for the next trade apply the same system to a 1 hr chart and look for another entry have a look at Jacko's forex house of pleasure and pain anti-hedging strategy apply normal trading techniques to get back in, at 10 am gmt there was divergence, quasi hammer and a couple of other reasons to have got in around 1.95

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Bull101, in your money management and exit strategy section you say that one should open 2 trades for a signal and together they should not risk more than 3% of one's account. you have 10 open trades now. how is you money management on these trades ? because i'm sure you won't risk 20-30% of your acccount at any time, or would you ?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
...so far... EURUSD went +4 pips (breakeven)... all the other orders still open, causing me stomach pain when i look at them... i have to correct myself, SL im using is 45 not 50 pips. but okay... anyway im taking notes of everything for analysis... could someone tell me... i really forgot since i read to much different things yesterday... my trade stays open until it hits SL or TP, right? i would not close it just because a new candle begins? and then... what if the trade stays open... and i get a complete reversal signal? i mean, i wouldnt go short and long on the same pair at the same time? anyone had a situation like that already?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
update... EURGBP and USDCHF got both stopped out at -100... that hurts... EURAUD seems to move the right direction... giving me some hope... balance for now -196 pips... okay, i consider this unlucky start and will give it a few weeks... since i see u guys having some result with this...

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Bull101....your short entry rules for this system state: Short Entry Criteria: 1. The Awesome Oscillator has changed to red. 2. The Stochastic Histogram has changed to red. On xrunner's chart the Stoch Histogram did change from green to red. But the AO didn't change to red....it was already red from the day before. I thought they both had to change at the same time from green to red or vice versa for a long signal. What am I missing here?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
GRPip you have to go back and read the posts that B101 has written, he has already clarified this aspect about the bars not needing to change colours both at the same time, nor there is any specific rule regarding which one changes first. When one changes colour to match the other one regardless of the fact that the other one was already of the same colour then its a signal. He also mentions that he won't consider a signal if its a repeat one, he will wait for the opposite signal in that case. Hope this explains, but if still in doubt you got to go back and read all the posts he has written xrunner

--- 帖子 #180 ---
My EA takes the signals as it sees them. Bull, is this "Time Window" an absolutely important part of your system?

I do not re-enter trades, so this would have been a loss with no re-entry. Bull101

--- 帖子 #184 ---
The current situation does not happen that often. However, if I had been able to trade yesterday, I would have taken each trade.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
The only time you would close both trades before a TP or SL is if the AO changes to the opposite color of entry. The second trade will always either be closed by a stop loss, or the AO changing to a reversal color. Bull101

--- 帖子 #186 ---
No Worries, the system will pull through Bull101

--- 帖子 #187 ---
That is how I have always traded it, so I have to say yes. However, I have never tested any other way, so I honestly can't really say how important it really is. Bull101

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi Bull when you say stand aside when will you stand aside i.e what happens if you are in a trade already will close it or trade through it? when there is interest rate do check the date when it is coming and do not enter new trades for the pairs that it could effect? Could you please tell us exactly what you do so this can be traded exactly the same way that you have been trading it so that it will reflect the same profits that you have been getting in the past and in the future. With thanks David

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hello David, For open trades: It depends on what point the trade is in. If the break even has been set, I will usually just let it run. If there is the original -100 stop loss, depending on how far above 0 it is, I will set a break even stop loss early. If the trade is negative, I will usually just close it. When there is major news coming out, I will post exactly what I am doing about it. Hope that clears it up, if not, let me know, Bull101

--- 帖子 #190 ---
xrunner....as you suggested, I went back and re-read Bull's posts and you are correct....thanks for the help!

--- 帖子 #191 ---
alright, thanks for answer AO... yes, sir!

i do absolutely believe in that system... (otherwise i would not test it) EUR AUD went nice from 1.6400 to 1.6300... yesterdays short signal made 100 pips... current standing -76 pips, but still AUDUSD open and looking good so far...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Boy, I love to make work for others!!! (Raygun.... "Possible" additions to the EA: 1. Add a TradeStart and TradeEnd time.. we can set to Bulls 0000 - 0010 gmt, or to any window we want... 2. Add a "ExitAtIndicatorTurn" yes or no input. This would close trades if both indicators turn the opposite color (doesn't have to be at the same time, and can be anytime throughout the day.) If both "halves" of our trade are open, both would be closed. (Bull mentioned he does this.). If the first half closed at +100, then the second half would close at StopLoss (which by this time would have moved to +1p, breakeven), or if the indicators turn. Making it Boolean would allow us to use that trade mgmt, or not... What fun... some day, I gotta learn mq4...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Buuuutttt..... wouldn't a valid short signal be the end of the long trade? In other words, wouldn't the two indicators turning against the trade be the signal to exit all positions long, and enter short? Is it because the one indicator is just BARELY red... (very small bar....) as I look at it now, about 0230 gmt, the very short bar has grown to be a decent red bar.... Seems like a clear signal now??? thanks for the clarification in advance... still learning over here!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Caught the foolishness in this method today.... the bar colors do change within 24 hours. Do not waste your time unless you base it on closed bars. This thread will die within 15 days. So long!

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hello, The reason I do this is because I see all trades out until they run their full course. Regardless of what I see, if the first trade has not closed yet, I allow all trades to continue running their course. If that doesn't clear it up, please let me know Bull101

--- 帖子 #213 ---
This is correct, the bars can change colors during the day. However I have found that using this system, and waiting for bars to close creates late entries, and overall less profit, as you would have seen if you had read the thread. Thanks for your time and input, Bull101

--- 帖子 #214 ---
How gracious =D

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Back to post 212... still a bit confused... You wait for the long trade to "run it's course..." before looking for a Short... I didn't explain myself well... Doesn't the valid short signal "end the course" for the Long trade? ... so don't the indicators both turning red at the beginning of the new day (or within the 10min window), constitute the long trade "running it's course"? Maybe I don't understand the full "life" of a trade with this system... what "running it's course" really is. Here is how I understand how a trade closes out, other than hitting the SL, or BE Stop. Trade is in two parts. The first half closes at +100p, the 2nd half closes when you get a valid signal the opposite direction... (which is what we have here...)... Or maybe the confusion is in the brokers... the broker/trade in question is on a different time than GMT, so the signal may be different than yours... Are you saying that for your broker, you didn't get a valid Short? If so, then you would indeed ignore that trade, and wait for a valid short on YOUR brokers' chart... Maybe that's it... and to FXHOUNDs comment about waiting for closed bars.... as I understand it, that is EXACTLY what Bull does (and we are learning to do)... Wait for the new day, 0000gmt, on any broker that is on GMT, this is when the previous day bar CLOSES, and the new day bar starts. At that instant, the indicators for the new bar are the same as the CLOSED bar, so you are looking at the CLOSED bar. If we have a new signal we enter. If not, we give the new bar a 10min window to change to give us a signal. If it does, and we get a valid signal within those first 10 min, we enter. If not, we are done for the day, and wait for the next day, at the CLOSE of this days bar... do it again.. .right??

Hi Bull thanks for the info David

If you add a crossing MA 1 crossing a MA 1 with a +1 shift you would have a good signal to go with this. At the cross wait for his signals with the histograms and go with the trade. If price goes above the MA lines you can consider getting out. It is about the same as drawing a tight trend line. When the trend line is broken go with it. when it unbreaks bail out. I dont think this method is foolish at all. I prefer a 4H chart better but 1 day is cool.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
this can be helpful. i notice it with EMA, it is an ema right ?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
with a 1 it makes no difference what you use but I usually use LWMA it reacts the quickest of all of them. If you use open it makes a nice trendline, when the trendline is broken you can look to go the other way or exit your trade. Notice in the pic how the yellow line makes a nice trend line on a daily chart. With other time frames you would change the numbers. If price is above the yellow its a buy, below the yellow its a sell. The indicator confirms the trend and you can go. If price goes above the yellow on a sell you can look to get out of the trade, you dont have to wait the 100 pips. It gives you an indicator to enter or exit the trade. With the MA it just gives you one more visual thats quicker than his signals but you will also get some false signals also so his becomes a good filter.

I agree with B101. There is no way you can tell how a system is going to be after just one week. I still think you can get the 80% win rate that B101 has been getting. Plus if what he said is true and you rarely have 10+ trades open at one time, I'm sure we can get back into profit very quickly.

Hi Bull do you not think it is a good idea to keep the google page that is updating the performance every 5 sec or every 5 min i for one find this very good to see at a glance what is happening. Also i want to say very well done to you and your effort that you are putting into this, yes it as been a first hard week but i for one would like to see the downside early on in systerm and to see how the systerm comes though than to have really good results at first then have a problem with it and say that it is not working and then go looking for somethink else, anyway thanks for doing what you are doing.

This system is so familiar with OZfx. Its a de ja vu when there will be a requested to donate for some charities, when there is a post of profits- thousands of virtual pips, and there will be a paid signal service for a limited number of subscribers. Bump~!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
It most certainly will not be like that at all.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Well the losing streak continues. I have decided to re-add the 200 simple moving average to this system. I had removed it during earlier testing, but after recent results, I have concluded that it is a required part of this system. It will keep us out of some trades, but the trades we take will run longer, farther, and entries are much more accurate. Thanks everyone. Bull101

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Good move. Taking half the trades last week was more than enough action. I was fortunate in that, by and large, I took the trades that were profitable or were BE trades. I must say that I admire your guts for posting signals live like this. You deserve a lot of credit for that.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I agree 100%. Most would just stop posting until their system became profitable again and then start posting all the time. This shows just how credible B101 is. I thank you for being honest with your system and not trying to fool anybody. I'm sure there are some who have already stopped trading this system because of the results but to be honest, if they have, they are not people we want in this thread anyway. I'm a sports fanatic so I'm going to use an example. Michael Jordan is said to be the best to every play in the NBA (some will argue but that's not the point of this). He missed 20,100 of the 35,087 total shots that he took (field goal, free throw and 3 point attempts combined). That equates to hime making a little more than 42% of all shots he took. Now look at the success that he had in his career making just 42% of his shots. He did not let the numbers game sidetrack his determination and work ethic. There are many people here who would quit trading forever if they got 42% of their trades correct. The point I'm trying to make is, nobody, nor system is perfect. This is especially for the new users to this forum who may come across this thread and see the results. So to B101, I give you a ton of credit for not getting caught up in the numbers game staying the same even through this losing streak. To those who continue to trade during the rough periods, it will all pay off for you in the end. I'm 25 and I've been trading on a part time basis for a little over two years and I've had rocky times but I've never given up. I truly want to see all of those who fight through hard times succeed. Good trading to all!

ronald raygun, would it be simple to add this 200sma to the EA you have written for this trading system?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I've got a signal on NZDUSD (using ODL demo) though I can't tell if it came on between the first 10 minutes from the open as I couldn't be on the computer exactly at that time. Would that be a valid signal? (Of course, taking it now would be a very late entry). http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f2...ece/nzdusd.gif

--- 帖子 #250 ---
See attached. Just enter in the period of the SMA you want to use.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hello, This was a correct entry signal. However as you said, it would be very late. The reason I did not call this is because of the re addition of the SMA, and that it had just closed out previous long. I have decided to wait until it has given another long signal, and then entering on the next short. Let me know if that doesn't clear it up, Bull101

Trade Updates Break evens have been set for USD/CHF and NZD/CHF Thanks Bull101

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I guess the obvious question is (so easy to see in hindsight, so I'm not bashing you at all): Why did you remove the 200-day MA criteria during your early testing? While I suspect that it produced lower overall returns, but reduced the number of bad weeks. And the biggest question of all: How many of the losing trades from the past week of trading would the 200-day filter have eliminated?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hello major, My reasoning behind removing the 200sma was that I had though that it kept us out of more trades than it would save us from losses. I believed that it would in fact make us less money than it would end up protecting. If we had been using the SMA the entire time, we would only have 2 losses right now. (It would have prevented 4 losing trades, or 800 lost pips.) I have decided now that it is in fact a vital part of this system, and will not be removing it again. Thanks major, Bull101

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Wow...that is very comforting to know. I think one way to look at is that when you have strong system with minimal drawdowns and a high ratio of wins to losses, a trader can confidently increase return by simply increasing the position size. That is preferable to a system with higher, but more volatile returns. In that case, it's hard to increase position size because you can wind up doing that at the beginning of a losing streak and then get yourself in a major hole.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
This is very true. We should see the regaining of those lost pips very shortly. Bull101

Hi Bull, Thanks for the great thread and easy to understand strategy. I have been following this strategy and others and found a different MM strategy to use that has yielded some good pips over the last week: - Use Bull's strategy for entry - Open 4 minilots (or lots) rather than 2 - Close each minilot at 40-50 pips profit (depends on pair) - Break even at first TP I have converted an old OzFX indicator to display TrendFinder signals for all currency pairs on one chart. I have attached the indicator and a spreadsheet detailing my results for the last week. I am not a programmer; just someone who can read some of the great code RR and others have written and make small changes. BTW, I placed all of these trades on an MIG demo account, so everyone may not see these signals as I did. Again, thanks for the great strategy. Bioquim

hi bull101 does the stoch histogram paint the past ? thanks

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Yes it does. Not only does it show you the past, it does it rather slowly. Go into your standard indicators and drag a stochastic oscillator into the same window as your histogram (same settings on both). With this set up you can see the stoch movement before the color changes on the histo(history)gram. I hope this helps. Jim

Hello MM, I would not recommend entering later than 10 minutes after I post my signals. To ensure your getting them fast enough make sure to sign up for the mailing list, and check my website as I post them there first. However, entering into Friday's signals on Sunday I would most definitely consider that to be a late entry and would not recommend doing it. However, there will always be more signals to come Bull101

Hello, They use the exact same values, so either one will work fine. I just find that the stoch histogram is easier for newer users to use. Bull101

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hello Smknyc, Any broker will work fine, however, you will need to use an ODL Demo account to find your entries. I put my live orders through FXCM , but use ODL Demo to find my entries. Thanks, Bull101

hi bull 101 i have a question lets take the exemple of EU , it has been a few days above 200 and AO green ,stock histogram green , let s say today is green too and above 200 , is this considered an entry ?? or the entry is only when the first ao and stoch histogram turn from red to green ? thanks imad

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hello imad, This would be considered a late entry. You must enter at the open of the day that the indicators change. If they change in the middle of the day, then we would need to wait until there is a brand new entry signal. Hope that helps Bull101

--- 帖子 #300 ---
the sma 200 is really usefull... even im trading the 4h trendfinder, taking the 200sma off the daily chart tells me which way were going... its a good addition... nice to see the system evolving

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Knowing how and why things work always helps to build confidence in a system so... Does anybody have research on why the 200-day MA works as a filter for Daily TF trades? Same question for the Awesome Indicator. It is amazing how well it seems to work on the Daily TF. But does anybody know what it is and why it works?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Here's a description of "what is" the Awesome Oscillator: http://www.metaquotes.net/techanalys...ome_oscillator

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hello major, The 200 period SMA works by taking the closing price of a day, adding it to the number of days calculated, then dividing it by the total number of days calculated. The longer the period used, the slower it is. By using 200 days to calculate it, it determines, very well, which way the trend is going. By only tranding with the trend, we will get better entries that will go for higher amount of pips in a single trade. The page that doblece posted describes how the AO works very well. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #304 ---
As of 0:20GMT I have not received a new candle on ODL. If the problem is resolved before 1:00 GMT I will still post signals for today. If not, I will consider anything after 1:00 to late of an entry. Thanks, Bull101

The daily candle has come, but there are no new signals for today. AUD/USD has been closed at +97. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Bull101 First I want to thank you for sharing your system ! Do the Awesome and Stoch have to change colour on the exact same candle ? or is it ok when one is already red, and the 2nd indicator becomes red ? I have looked back and never see them change exactly on the same bar. Where in MT4 can I check which time my broker uses ? Or can i tell MT4 what time to use ? I have also another chartingprogram which does not have the stochhistogram. As an alternative you mentioned that your histogram is the same as the main line crossing the 50-line. Which one do you consider the main line, %K or the %D ? Also I have installed the indicators and the template on a demo account from MIG. I dont see the USDCAD signal from july 1. Can you take a look at my chart to see what is wrong ? link to http://www.plaatjesupload.nl/bekijken/775617.html chart: http://www.plaatjesupload.nl/bekijken/775617.html as you can see there were already 2 green candles before your signal. tnx !

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Bull101....you stated on your website that there were no trades for today. What about AUD/USD Long? Today on ODL the daily chart shows a red stoch and a green AO for yesterday....today both signals are green and price is above 200 SMA. To be a valid long signal does the change have to be from two reds one day to two greens the next day? Can Bull101 or someone help me understand?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Bull i got 2 clear signal on EURCHF and EURGBP today, but i think i'll wait till it back into open price, correct me if i'm wrong. MM79

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Look again. They do. Just as an example: http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f2...ece/eurchf.gif Bull101 uses ODL charts. You can't "tell" your MT4 platform to use a particular time, but you can compare the candles with other brokers (H1 candles) and see if they show at the same time or not, and calculate the difference.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
On ODL charts, EURGBP signal was in yesterday's candle. EURCHF has indeed a signal today, but it's a LONG signal and the price is below SMA200 (see chart above) so we do not take those signals, as it has been discussed in previous posts.

Wow Guys, i am trading since one year with a few breaks when i burned my accounts and i was in a few trading and chat rooms while this time. But what i can see here, impresses me tough, i had a very tough learning phases, but i never saw anything like here where people help each other kindly and become successful together. I was rereading almost the whole thread and i would like to install this system on my mt4 platform and i dont want to ask double questions if it is not necessary. My Congratulations to Bull and the Community for this, how it looks like, great job and i hope it´s okay when i say, we see us. greetings, tickticker

--- 帖子 #314 ---
what do you mean by a complete short entry signal? can you be specific?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Is it right guys, that Bull will post here the new trading signal, as far as there exist some? Cannot see a new daily candle on ODS till now, do you know when it shall come out on ODS in GMT Time, just asking, i live in GMT-1, so when they would give out their candle at 0:00 GMT, than they are a lil late, or i am wrong greetings

--- 帖子 #316 ---
ODL's new daily candle begins at 7 p.m. Central Daylite Time....or in about 55 minutes.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thanks a lot GRip, didnt know that, that explains maybe also why the system loos slightly different on other brokers charts, on xtb i have already a new candle since now almost one hour, thanks bro

--- 帖子 #318 ---
My point of view: Given the fact that a setup must be above SMA 200 to be LONG and below it for a SHORT, there are times in which AO and AC may have changed to the opposite (let's say we have a LONG valid signal and thereafter a SHORT signal but there is no setup for a reversal, being still above the SMA 200) so when it gives a new LONG signal it is like the continuation of the first LONG. Bull101 seems to take "alternative trades", that is, if he has taken a true SHORT on one pair, next trade will have to be a true LONG, and viceversa. No consecutive trades on the same side, apparently.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I haven't seen two consecutive long/short trades in a row based on the system anyway, so I think it's already built-in

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Ronald, I wasn't referring to the EA, but to the fact that you can have sometimes a change of color for just one bar in both and after that the previous trend resumes, but it is a "no trade" bar color change. It happens sometimes, as for example in the last days, an apparent short signal on EURGBP but above the SMA200.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Help me out guys, so am I right to say that signals for today 4 July 2008, Friday are GBPUSD short EURAUD short thks

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Think only EUR/AUD short is a valid signal....at least that's the only only pair I traded tonite. The AO bar on the GBP/USD was red previously and stayed that way today, so wasn't a change....but the stoch bar changed from green to red. At least that's the way I understand this system....someone please correct me if I'm wrong. And btw....I'm down 30 pips on that E/A pair right now! Hope all you good folks have a great 4th of July!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
So isnt the GBPUSD a valid signal as AO is red (yes, it wasn't a change) and the Stoch has just turned from green to red, and price is below SMA200; According to Bull101 post #12, he does not wait for the candle to close ie today's candle and he analysed the trade for about 10 mins ( between 00:00 to 00:10 GMT)

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Please have a look at posts Nº 13 and Nº 15 which address this precise issue.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Post 13 and 15 clarified that GBPUSD is not a valid signal today because AO has changed to red long ago and is considered a late entry. Quote: Originally Posted by zamiriqbal http://www.forexfactory.com/images/buttons/viewpost.gif WEDNESDAY: STOCHASTIC BAR CLOSES AT RED , aWSOME OSCIALLTOR BAR CLOSES ON GREEN.

Yes you would go long in this situation. -Unquote- ------------------------------ ok, I was confused by post 72; so it seems that AO must reflect a change while Stochastics need not reflect a change ie Case A: Thurs Fri AO red red Stoch green red Not a valid signal for SHORT Case B: Thurs Fri AO red green Stoch green green This is a valid signal for LONG

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Bull i got clear signal on E$, and on 4hour chart it seems it will bounce for a while then it'll goin down.... correct me if i'm wrong

--- 帖子 #327 ---
i know price still above 200 SMA,but it seems like E$ had strong down signal,since it break the TL....

--- 帖子 #328 ---
hi all am reading the trade and setup with interest, have a small question if someone can help pls: - once you trigger the sell/buy from the setup of the daily, would you use a smaller TF to monitor the trade just in case their would be any sign of reversal? or its a set and forget system and just let it try hot you TP? thanks

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hello everyone, Due to a family emergency I was unable to check in on the forums. Please note I took the following trades for 7/4/08: GBP/USD Short at 1.9835 EUR/AUD Short at 1.6337 Also, all other open positions have now been closed due to reversal of the Awesome Oscillator on those trades. I need to get some sleep for now, I'll be going through all your questions as soon as I wake up Thanks everyone, Bull101

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Ok, Bull finally posted his signals today and GBPUSD short is a valid signal contrary. So as of today, forgetting all previous posts it seems that as long as AO, Stoch are aligned in the same colour, doesnt matter which turn colour first or whether it had stayed in the same color previously, and of course with the sma200, the signal is valid

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi I am a forex trader but due to family pressures I cannot trade during the day at all now. I was looking at this eod system to fill a gap..it seems logical but looking at some of the chart I'm slightly confused about the entries.I will be entering the trades approx 9pm in the evening UK time. I have the 3 inds in histogramme on my chart and if Im doing this right a sell signal is when all 3 confire red...soooooooo The top 2 can be red already then the bottom histograme goes from green to red and thats our signal..is that correct.I know you guys use a 200 day moving average also I know how u use this but here is my chart each vertical red line is a short signal when all 3 concure red ..Is this correct cheers paulus

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Ronaldosim....seems you may be correct.....now I'm more confused than ever! In Post #1 on this thread Bull states: Long Entry Criteria: 1. Price is above the 200sma. 2. The Awesome Oscillator has changed to green. 3. The Stochastic Histogram has changed to green. Short Entry Criteria: 1. Price is Below the 200sma. 2. The Awesome Oscillator has changed to red. 3. The Stochastic Histogram has changed to red. The key word in the above entry rules quote is " changed !" According to Bull's last post, the GBP/USD is a valid signal, although the AO was already red....it did not " change ." Bull....can/will you clear up this confusion and give us a final set of rules for a valid entry signal? Sure would be helpful!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I think Bull has already answered that question. The bars do not need to change simultaneously. Note these previous posts:

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Figured I'd find you lurking around here Yen

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hello, The %K line is the Stochastic Main Line. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hello Lawrence, There must be a complete reversal signal before re entering into a specific pair. For example, If we have just taken a Short Trade on GBP/USD. Stochastic Histogram must turn Green, and well as the AO turn green before we would re enter into a short trade. Bull101

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hello, This is correct, it does not matter which indicator turns first, just as long as they have aligned. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hello Everyone, I'm pretty sure I went through and answered the questions I have missed the last couple of days. If I have missed any, please don't hesitate to ask again, i'm always ready for more questions Open Trades: GBP/USD - Short, Currently at +21 EUR/USD - Short, Currently at +31, Break even has been set for both lots. Thanks Everyone, Bull101

yen44x....appreciate your help....and Bull, thanks for a good system....maybe I've got it straightened out now and will be ready for next week!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Darn . . . caught me red-handed. I figure if it's got the RR "Seal of Approval" there must be something worth looking at.

If its got the RR AND yen44x "Seal of Approval" it must be worth reading and studying it. All the best to both of you Forex37

Hello everyone, I hope you all had a great weekend. June 7th 2008 No new signals for today. Bull101

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Wow, I apologize for that mistake. The trade is EUR/AUD, not EUR/USD. Very sorry for that mistake, it won't happen again. Bull101

--- 帖子 #345 ---
how about this?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Ha ha -- no prob whatsoever! You've already gone way beyond the call of duty as it is. But my sincere hope is that your active role and leadership in this thread will, in itself, help to take your trading success to the next level! Same for those of who are learning from you as well.

Hello Gren, GBP/USD was a signal on July 4th. Bull101

June 8th 2008 No new signals for today.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Bull....it's already July....remember? 8^) And....I reckon I'll never get this system straight! Can someone tell me why NZD/USD Short isn't a valid signal today? The Stock has been red for six days, but the AO just turned red today after two days of green. Today's candle is under 200 SMA, so looking for shorts. So everything seems to be lined up red. What's wrong with this signal?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
BTW....forgot to add....this morning both trades of my EUR/AUD short from last week hit stop loss/breakeven at price of 1.6334.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
ok, let me try. This is considered a late entry because the Stoch has been red for too many days (6 days as you said). The next question is - so many days shld we consider the signals to be not late?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
NZDUSD as a SHORT entry hasn't had a complete reversal (a valid LONG signal) since its last short signal.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
This is the correct answer to GR's question. There must be a complete reversal signal before we would re enter any pair. Note: A complete reversal does not include the 200sma. --------------------------- Trade Updates: EUR/AUD - Both lots closed at Break Even. GBP/USD - 1 lot closed at +100, 2nd lot currently at +94.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Bull101 Just to have a complete understanding, I have attached a chart for nzdusd showing the valid signals and today's invalid signal because there is no complete reversal. Please verfiy my interpretation of your system to be correct. Many thks!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hello Ronaldosim, You are 100% correct if you are disregarding the 200sma. If you are using the 200sma, then all of the longs would not be valid. But you are correct about today not being a valid short. Thanks for the image, Bull101

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Thanks Bull and Ronaldosim for your help....think I understand the system better now!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Great to hear

--- 帖子 #358 ---
July 9th 2008 No new signals today again. Most pairs are going against their trend for the time being. There will most likely be a good amount of trades by the end of this week/beginning of next week. Thanks all, Bull101

Bull....have you or anyone else noticed that the Stoch bar is trying to change color on the EUR/GBP from green to red?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Yes, it did change color on my screen too, flipping from green to red and now back to green

--- 帖子 #362 ---
The EUR GBP trade is a good call. It is bouncing off a support line. The only problem is it going 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hey GRPip, Yes this is true, it did start switching back and forth. It was green at the open though, and I trade this system 100% mechanically. Bull101

Bull are you sure the entry on .7924? because it seems the the lower price today at .7932 Thnx, MM79

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Signals for July 11 2008 Hello everyone, This is a late entry as I was away from the computer. This however should not happen anymore as I believe everything around here has finally begun to calm down EUR/USD - Long at 1.5798. I do believe this pair has enough power to make it to our exit points even with the late entry. Thanks all, Bull101

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hello MM, I am sure that this was my entry, here is a post of currently open trades below. Please ensure you are using ODL to check these entry signals, sometimes broker's prices can be slightly different. Thanks, Bull101 http://img509.imageshack.us/img509/8...ntradespz2.jpg

Hi Bull: Nice thread and nice effort. keep it up. Lately i don't see any signal update on your web site, nor do i regularly get your signal. Just wondering. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hello forexxer, I decided to just post the signals on the forum on my site, still working on a good way to get rid of the main page and keep the menu system in tact. I'll put a redirect from the main site to the forums for now until I can work out a better system Thanks, Bull101

well,i missed one of those....but that's ok i'm closed my EU +125 pips today, better u put ur glasses on next time Bull....

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi Bull101 and others, What a great system. I am kind of new on this thread but following very well. Seen great profits on demo following trade signals as given by great members of this threat. I have a little problem setting up the 200 SMA on my chart. I click indicator, selected MA, Put on simple and changed the period to 200 then OK. But it will not appear on the chart. When I select other periods like 20 or 14 it will appear. I am I doing anything wrong? Please Help

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Try zooming out after applying the 200SMA. Remember that a moving average is just that, an average price over the however many bars it says.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi Ray, Thanks. I get it now.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi Bull, Wonderful thread. Thank You for creating it and keeping it going. Just an idea, how about an alert sent on Yahoo Messenger?. It is easy for everyone to create an yahoo account and get Yahoo Messenger. Then whenever your ready just send out a message to everyone on it. Just an idea. It is free and would not cost anything for anyone. i know some signal providers use that to deliver their signals. Jeff

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hello Bull, The signals you refer to is Stoch and AO and 200 SMA Above/below Daily candle. Correct? Also my brokers open daily candles at Midnight est and 8 est.Would that time be OK to trade your system? Thank you

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi Bull, Would you then place a limit sell at reversal? I'm not clear on this.I though you go long on green? Thanks

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hello Jeff, That shouldn't be a problem to setup. I'm currently on Yahoo under the name ForexBull101@yahoo.com . Let me think about it over the weekend, and maybe starting Monday i'll send out the signals via Yahoo messenger as well as email. Yahoo would definitely be a faster option for getting the signals out. Thanks for the tip! Bull101

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hello, ODL opens at 0:00GMT (8pm Est) So that would be fine. My actual live account broker opens its daily candle at 5pm EST ( FXCM ) But I find my signals via an ODL demo account. Either way, you should be alright. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hello, That did come out kind of confusing. What i meant by that post was that we would not enter into Another Short trade, until a long signal has been shown. For example: Monday, Price is below 200sma, AO and Stoch are red, we take a short position on GBP/USD. Tuesday, AO Changes to Green, so we exit the trade. Wednesday AO Changes back to Red, however, stochastic did not ever turn green (It remained red the entire time AO was Green), so we would NOT take this short entry. Thursday, both AO and Stoch turn Green, but the price is below the 200SMA, so that is not a long signal, however, it now allows us to take the next short entry. Friday, AO and Stoch turn RED, and the price is below the 200sma, so we would now enter a short trade. (Please note these indicators will not move this fast, just naming the days for the sake of the example) What i'm trying to say, is that we would not take another short trade until AO and Stoch have shown a long signal. That sounds confusing as i'm typing it out, let me know if that doesn't clear it up. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Actually, this is the best explanation of this rule that I've seen yet. Perhaps you could add it to your first post, as I think it would clear up a lot of confusion regarding what is and isn't a valid signal. Good luck on your thread.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
ok I new to your system and I would like to know if that entry would be a good one. candel close just above the 200 moving average and I got a 1st green on AO and on the stoch. Sorry for my English, I'm French Canadian. I don't know if the link for the fxcm micro is on the thread so there he is http://www.forexmicrolot.com/ http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/7...rendzo8.th.jpg

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Bull, Thank you so much for taking so much time and energy to explain all this to us. I pretty much get it except this. What i'm trying to say, is that we would not take another short trade until AO and Stoch have shown a long signal. Let me answer my own q. to see if I understand it fully. Because it is continuation of a short trend we need to establish a long signal on Stocs and AO at a pull back and hope that the signals would change again from long to short and the price must be below 200 SMA at the same time we get long signals on indicators. Am I at least close? Thank you again

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hello, This would actually not be a correct entry signal. The Reason, We only take signals based on what the indicators are saying at the very start of the candle. Since at the beginning of this candle, the price was still below the 200sma, there would be no long signal available for this pair. Hope that answers your question, Bull101

--- 帖子 #386 ---
That is 100% correct. We would of course not take the Long signal (because the 200sma would not be in agreement,) but it would then open the door for taking the next short signal. Bull101

--- 帖子 #387 ---

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hello Safive, I actually choose to ignore the Sunday candle. However, EUR/USD was a signal on July 11th, so I would consider entering now to be a late entry. Currently we have closed out the 1st lot at +100, and the 2nd lot is at +166 at the time of writing this. I will be posting todays signals in about 2 and 1/2 hours. (0:00GMT) Bull101

Hello nedal, Have you added the indicator to your mt4 directory under, Experts/indicators? If that is not working, you can load the regular stochastic indicator and follow the main line.

hi Bull first thanks for your great signals i have a question you have said that we enter short or long when the color of the ao change from green to red or from red to green . but in the case of nj today , this is the second ao red , yesterday we had one and today a new one red ? so what makes it valid this signal and is it still following the orginal rules or you have used some discretion here regards

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hello imad, The reason for not entering yesterday is because Stochastic had not yet changed. Both indicators need to be the same color before entering a pair. Please note, they do not have to change at the same time, just as long as they both change. I think I need to clarify the rules page a little bit. Let me know if that doesn't answer your question Bull101

--- 帖子 #414 ---
hi well i think it does . yesterday the stochastics where crossing down but didnt reach yet the 0 line . i understand from you now that it is not enough they cross heading down it should be crossing the 0 line too with the ao red . am i right ? did i get it ? or not yet regards imad

--- 帖子 #415 ---
by the way bull i am using the stochastic 5.3.3 and not the histogram because i saw somewhere it is not as accurate as the normal stochastic , would appreciate your comments thanks

--- 帖子 #416 ---
This is correct. AO Needs to be red, and Stochastic Histogram needs to be red. If you are using the regular stochastic indicator, then the main line needs to have completely crossed its 50 line. Also, please make sure you are using stochastic in a separate indicator window, and watching to make sure it is crossing the 50 line, not the 0 line of the AO indicator. Bull101

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I have heard this as well, but I have yet to find a situation where the histogram has not displayed correctly. You can use either one though. The histogram turns color when the stochastic main line has crossed the 50 line. Bull101

I have released a new money management strategy as of today. This will begin being used at 0:00GMT Tomorrow (July 18th 2008) The new strategy is as follows: Lot 1: Take profit at +50 pips Lot 2: Take Profit at +100 pips. Original Stop Loss for both trades: -100 When trades reach +50, set both lots to break even. You can view the reasons for the change at the following post on my site: http://trendfinder.freehostia.com/fo...c.php?f=4&amp;t=28 Thanks all, Bull101

Hi Bull, I was wondering to these change in management rules also apply to the 4hr system i.e 50 pips for the first lot and 100 pips take profit for the second lot. I think this would work better too for the 4 hour as well. Please let me know Alkis p.s - Thanks for this great system, I am having good result on both 4 hour and Daily timeframes

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hello, I have made these changes to the 4hr system as well. I apologize for not supporting that system and answering questions on it at this time.

For the last few months, the market has not been trending as strong as it normally does. Therefore, our 2nd lot has not been running nearly as long as it usually does. I have decided to stop allowing the 2nd lot to run. For now on, 1st Lot: Take profit set at +50 2nd Lot: Take Profit set at +100 After the market begins trending strongly again, I may add on a 3rd lot to allow it to run, but at this time, it is +50, and +100. Thanks everyone, Bull101

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hello bull101, I have been following your tread for several days. Thank you for sharing your system. The next pairs are for giving a signal for today; EURJPY, NZDUSD and CHFJPY. From the last candles movement it could will happen. (Sunday 00:00 gtm) If these pairs get both indicators in same color could be acceptable signals? Thank you

--- 帖子 #434 ---

Looks like you were correct on all 3. Good call Bull101

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hello, I have only tested this system using ODL, so I would recommend using the EA on ODL. Bull101

--- 帖子 #439 ---
My EAs should be broker independent. So it doesn't matter. They are all the latest version, I believe I released them at the same time. the EAs don't paint lines for you. They are calculated internally. If you want to see the 200SMA as confirmation, go ahead and attach it.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Is this website's signals using the same trading rules as this thread?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Be careful, everyone: The Trend Finder Template shows different color (AO and STO) between FXDD and ODL. The signals posted in this thread is according to the reading on ODL.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
i am using an alpari chart and the signals seem to be very different to the ODL chart. Does this mean that the EA could only be used on ODL? Also on the CADJPY the signal to go long - price was underneath the 200 MA on the Alpari chart. Was it different on the ODL chart? Can anyone shed some light on this and if it is possible to use an Alpari chart to trade this system? Many thx

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Ron, Are you around? By running this EA last night: I had one pair of USD/CAD opened at 12:00 ODL market time and close at 12:01 with -19 pips lost (due to TS set = true). I think that most likely it's a bug.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I think it's because there was a huge spread. You mean to tell me the price moved 12-18 pips with a fixed spread in one second? Also, what was the TS set to? I think the default trailing stop on my EAs is 20 or 30.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hello, I recommend you open an ODL demo account so you can follow along. Sometimes brokers will have slightly different values. I am actually using FXCM as my live broker, but I find entries via an ODL Demo account. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I meant to tell you, that EA has opened a wrong pair as well.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
That's almost impossible. The EA is designed to open trades on the same pair as the chart it was placed on. The only way that's possible is if you are changing the chart which the EA was placed on. Could you please post anything from the "Journal" and "Expert" tab? That will help me most in trying to diagnose this problem.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I love to help. Where is the "Journal" and "Expert" tab at?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
They are at the very bottom of your Terminal window within the MetaTrader chart.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Great, found it! File is too big, won't let me upload. Can I have Ron or Yen's e-mail address? Just PM to me is fine.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Oh, Ron, when I said wrong pair: I meant, this pair is not a qualified trade: Market day 07/21/2008 USD/CAD opened on ODL 12:00 market time, and closed by EA on ODL 12:01 market time.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
You don't need the entire file . . . just take a "snapshot" of anything in those tabs that relate to the trade you're asking about.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Ron and Yen, I discovered the problem from the MT4 Jurnal log: It was because the EA attached to the USDCAD H1 chart, not the D1 chart.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
There you go =D. Hopefully that was the solution.

Trade 1: Set a take profit of +50 pips. Trade 2: Set at take profit of +100 pips. Both Trades: When you reach +50 pips, set the stop loss for both trades to 0. (Break even) Bull101....above is your changed money mgmt strategy as listed in Post #1....and I'm confused (as usual). My question is this....when you reach +50 pips profit for both trades, isn't trade #1 closed out automatically with the +50 pips TP? How can you then set both trades to Break Even, if trade #1 is already closed out by the TP?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
You are correct, trade one is closed at +50. I should have worded it better I'll correct it after today's signals. Thanks, Bull101

July 23rd 2008 AUD/CAD - Long at .9798

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Bull101....according to my ODL charts, this morning my EUR/GBP daily stoch histogram started trying to change from green to red with price going down. At the start of today's new candle, both the stoch and AO are red and I'm down 30 pips. Since this trade has done a complete turn around, do we now just hold everything as is, keeping the SL's at -100? Or do we at least move both SL's to -50 to minimize losses?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
This is correct, EUR/GBP is now showing a reversal signal. (Minus the sma.) I will continue to hold this position with the original stop loss of -100 as I do not believe it will retract enough to close us out. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks, Bull101....reckon I'll hold on too!

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hey Ron, Are you there? This is an interesting bug (?) in your Trend Finder SMA filter EA: I opened ODL trade station before market open (my time 7pm CT), and this EA has been attached on each chart. I saw a few pairs opened, and none of them matching the rules. However, this morning, they all make VERY GOOD profits (Surprising Good!) Check it out the journal and setting file, please.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
How exactly were the trades the wrong rules? The journal looks fine, and so does the code... BUY: AO Green Stoch Above 50 Price above 200SMA SELL: AO Red Stoch below 50 Price below 200SMA And next time, can you please include the contents of the "Expert" tab for the offending experts? Thanks, --RR

--- 帖子 #480 ---
RR, I meant I have no doubt about your rule logics in your programming. But all the trades were opened byond the rules given in this thread. That surprised me, and it is Demo account, and it is a good surprise.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
That's the problem... How were the trades beyond the rules? Because for all I know, you got lucky.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
new here; read thread; trying to determine how Aud/Cad gave a long signal today when AO and stoch histo are short; is it because these two indicators were long briefly at GMT open but now are heading into today's close short? Is this a rule that you can wait up to 10 minutes after GMT open to determine indicators? Its not included on first page but read it in thread? Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hello, This is correct. AUD/CAD was a valid long signal. Unfortunately, the indicators can change sometimes. This does not happen often, but it does happen. There is really no set time limit for signals. It generally takes me 10 minutes or less to check through all of the pairs, that is why I said 10 minutes earlier in the thread. Thanks, Bull101

Bull 101 When do you get out of a position that was once valid? Do you just stay in until stop is hit or TP? I have 3 losing positions in the AUD/CAD. Are you still in it?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hello, I will, under most circumstances, continue holding a position. My AUD/CAD was closed out at both lots -100 pips. At this point I would recommend you exit. Bull101

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Ron, I manually closed every trade, and post it here for you. I don't know how your EA opened all these trades, but they are good mistakes. Makes 16% of profit in one day. Find out what is that, please? Setting is in my previous posting, EA name is Trend Finder Daily SMAfilter . All I did jsut open the ODL trade station upon market open everyday.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Thanks bull, I also took -100 pip loss. Bull101 Well, maybe + next time around. Many pips to you.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Ok, I don't really have an up-to-date chart on me at the momenet, but it looks like the trades were opened properly, and within the rules. Can you please show screenshots of where there were problems? If there is a recognizable pattern, we may end up modifying this system (With bull 101's permission of course).

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi Bull, Are you now trading the Daily system with 2 lots, the first with a TP of 50 pips and the second with a TP of 100 pips? When do you plan to implement an extra lot to run without TP until the AO shows a reversal signal? Are you actively trading your 4 Hour system as well? Will there be any modifications to this system in the future? I am actually trading the 4 Hour as well with TP of 50 and 100 pips with a good hit rate and some nice profit. Many thanks for these two systems!! Alkis

--- 帖子 #491 ---
My every chart is set up properly, and I have all ODL charts opened. I make sure open my ODL trading station everyday at market open time. If you open my statement, you will see all positions were opened at market open time, 00:00. So, I am going to post all pairs here for you, before I can do my own screenshot. If you open my attached statement, you see that NZDUSD is a very good trade, so is GBPJPY . Why? We need to find out.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I say keep the EA running. We'll see if this was luck because of a news breakout, and check again if the EA will repeat this success. If it's consistently pulling 1k+ from the same lot size, we may just want to optimize for those pairs.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Ron, It is not by luck, I just figured it out: When I tried to look at the 4H chart, I click on the 4H and the chart switched, then the EA checked on the 4H chart if it fits the requirement or not? If, yes, then open positions, so obviously TrendFinder Theory works much better for 4H chart. (anyone here with me?) I am making money right away, again, with several positions opened. And the way, EA opens positions, it does not look at the past few bars. It only looks at the Current indicators bar (Stoch and AO) and 200SMA. And it makes good money all the time, so you can close with few hundred pips and go. So, from open to close only take 15-20 min, I got 600 pips into my account. What happened here: the TrendFinder works much better with 4H than 1D bar. Ron, play it on your ODLstation, then find out by yourself! then share with us! Look at the statement 07/24 positions. I am 22% profit in 2 days.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Yes, the EA looks at the TF of the chart it's attached to. Just so we're 100% sure, can you please run them in parallel? (1 Set of Daily and 1 set of 4H). And so you don't have to post continuous statements, I suggest you use www.sm-forex.com (I'm surprised that my EAs are still in the top 10, almost 4 months after I stopped sending data to that site). Using the EA they provide, you can have your computer automatically upload trade data to that site.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Can't do screenshot on mine. The reason I am asking you not that I don't get it (I am a programmer, too.), but because it is wired to have this pair opened. Oright, I will give it more time to test from now.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Trader, I have the EA on 4hr charts as I think you said you have. I was wondering if I need to do something on the inputs or maybe do a manual trade in conjunction w/ the EA trade? Thanks again for your help.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
You should be able to if you're using metatrader. Just right click on the chart, then click on "Save as Picture"

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Oh, mine! Not a rocket science obeviously. I have 4 pairs opened at mt4 at 20:00 market time (ODL) now, and I believe this is going to work. For we are going to always have multiple pairs opened, as soon as we see some profit we harvest (close all). - my own strategy. I used to write some EA and Script for myself, I had one: Close_All.(need to dig it out) If you can harvest couple of times a day, nice enough. Will give you picture, later on.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Ron, This EA has to be fixed, first. When you see the attached picture you will know, we still need to fix some bugs here. For the EA only picks up Current Indicator Bar to judge (with 200SMA). According to Bull, it needs to be the bar has changed color to green/red. Find each chart and place your cursor over the bar that the position has opened, you will know.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Have a look at this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=333 The bars supposedly only need to be the proper color, as explained here:

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Yes, losses are never fun, but I have no worries that these pips will be regained in no time Bull101

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hello, That is correct. I am trading 2 lots, with set TP's of +50 and +100. I DO plan on implementing a 3rd lot when I believe the market has broken out of the short ranges it currently appears to be in. At that time, it would be a 3rd lot that we would let run until we see a reverse signal. I am currently actively trading my 4hr system. My goal is to get everyone going well on the Daily System for a little while, then going back and starting to support and release 4hr signals as well. Look out for 4hr signals in another month or so Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #512 ---
This is correct. The indicators do not have to change on the same bar to be a valid entry. They both must BE the same color to be a valid entry, but they do not have to change on the same day. However, I will only take a signal after the pair has shown a full reverse signal. (Not counting the SMA) Thanks for your work Ronald Bull101

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Bull, Do you think a pair: 5 bars red (Sto) and 6-7 bars red (AO) and under 200SMA is still a valid trade for Sell now? Or they better, just changed color to match and not too many old bars same color, yet? Hope you can understand my question.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
It sounds like you're trying to prevent "stale" signals. It makes sense. How do you suggest we prevent that?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Yeh, let's discuss on the number of bars later? Now, please look at the picture I attached: NZD/CHF, is that a bug? (Not to find problem for you, just try to help )

--- 帖子 #516 ---
If EachTickMode was set to true: not likely, the bar probably changed color after the trade was executed. If EachTickMode was set to false: then the only thing that may cause that was chart switching.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
This would be much to late of an entry. You are only to enter on the day that the indicators align. Lets say: Day 1: AO turns Red, Stoch is Green. Day 2: AO Remains Red, Stoch Remains Green. Day 3: AO Remains Red, Stoch turns Red. You would enter on Day 3. Anything past Day 3 would be to late of an entry. Bul101

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Maybe you need to check the number of bars of (Sto &amp; AO): 1. have been matched color (green/red), and 2. have been (positive/negative) ie (0+/0-). ====&gt; May not need this one! More checking is only giving more quality trades. But think about it, all trades will give one profit number together, I only need to close all at once when I am good with the number. I don't need to care about each trade has to be a winning trade. While you have enough positions opened, you just need to turn off the Expert Advisor from the top icon (green hat). I have Close_All script done, then hit Cntrl_V can close all trades in your good total profit number. In this scenario, a trader can profit each day at least 1 - 2 times. Let's give it a try!

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Right, and that's why I said that Ron needs to fix the EA bugs. EA: TrendFinderDailySMAFILTER

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Ron, I set it EachTickMode=false on both mt4 station, both opened this pair (NZDCHF). One mt4 never switched the chart.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
When EachTickMode is false, the EA only places trades at the open of the bar following the signal. That was--to the EA--a valid trade. But I see your point. I'll look into preventing these sort of trades tomorrow.

Bull, Thanks for your reply, please be sure to let us all know when you start to implement a 3rd lot to let run until a reversal signal. Do you have any idea as to when you will implement this? When do you see the market break out of these short ranges that it has been in lately? Regards Alkis

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I will definitely let everyone know when I begin the 3rd lot. That is correct, after the market breaks from the range it currently appears to be in. Unfortunately, I am unable to predict when it will break, but I highly doubt it will remain ranging for an extended period of time. Bull101

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi Trader, glad to hear of your success on the 4hr. However, does yours only open one position or? Could you describe for me what the EA is doing for you? I would greatly appreciate it. I understand, from what you all are saying that there are still some bugs. The EA for me is opening one position. If there is a change of direction it simply closes out the position etc. So was curious how it's working for you. Thanks for your help. Many pips to you!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hi Bull Are you applying the same daily rules to 4hr or are the rules different?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Ok Trendfinder Update: I updated the EA to check the previous bar for the opposite color before entering. This means the previous bar needs an indicator value which does not qualify that bar as a signal bar.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Ron, Just want to make sure: It is the bar before the previous bar is not a qualified bar, because the previous bar is a signal bar . (Or the current is a signal bar, so the previous bar is not a qualified bar.) -------- You know what I mean. -----------

--- 帖子 #530 ---
RR....what's the difference between the two new posted EA's? Which one should we use and on what timeframe?

--- 帖子 #531 ---
One EA uses the 200SMA as a filter. The other EA uses the original system. As for TF, Bull101 says D1, trader8686 says H4.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Guys, This is Bull's ( Bull101 ) thread, and I am still in testing my own for myself. So, don't look at my strategy, yet. Until I am very positive for the result, I may post to share with you all. Good luck to everybody here!

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Ron, Hey good job, this EA looks much better. It's really good!

Bull....I took the CAD/JPY short trade last evening at 105.70....opened two positions at that price....both trades SL at -100 or 106.70....trade 1 TP of +50....trade 2 TP +100. When the price reached +50 pips, then trade 1 was closed out at 50 pips profit and I moved the SL on remaining trade to Breakeven or 105.70. Earlier this morning, trade 2 price hit Breakeven SL and stopped me out at 105.70. In summary, had a +50 pips total profit on this trade. Was trade handled correctly according to your rules? TIA....and am looking forward to a better next week!

Hello Howard, There are different rules to the 4hr system to help filter out incorrect entries. I plan to begin supporting the 4hr system more in roughly a month or so. I want to get everyone going well on the daily system first, as it is more reliable, and accurate. Thanks, Bull101

--- 帖子 #537 ---
This was 100% correct (I forgot to update the statistics page on Friday, so if your following that page, it still showed it was open over the weekend, but the 2nd lot was closed sometime on Friday.) And yes, I am confident that we will see a much better week than last Good Job on your trade Bull101

Bull...guess the old saying "Oh ye of little faith" aptly applies to me! I got disgusted and weak-kneed last week, after losing -200 pips on the AUD/CAD, I gave up on the EUR/GBP Long trade and closed it out with a loss. I see that you followed the system....stayed in the trade as per the rules....now it apparently is coming back strong this week! Oh well....go figger!

Anyone know what's going on with Bull? No communication from him here or on his website this week. Anyway, I closed out first trade of EUR/GBP today at +50 pips....second trade still riding and is currently at +47 pips. Tonite USD/JPY Long appears to be a valid signal. Anyone agree....or disagree?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Has everyone just abandoned this thread....including Bull101? Or is he on vacation? I think this is a really good system and it'd be a shame to let this thread dry up! Anyone know what's going on here?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
IS EVERYONE PREVIOUSLY ON HERE DEAD? Can/will someone please explain what is happening with this thread? Where is everybody that was enthusiastically supporting this good system? Well....I'm still here and tonite went long with valid Buy signals on both E/J and G/J....still holding on second Long trade on E/G from earlier this week and am up by +30 pips.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
What does it matter to you? Do you need a support group to help you trade? As long as the system works I personally don't care how active the thread is.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
RR- We actually tried to start a Trend Finder Support Group, but as you can see, it didn't go over really well.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
heyy lets bring life back to this thread the EJ long position just got stopped out

--- 帖子 #554 ---
HAHAHAHAHAHA I guess the system is so simple to understand and trade that the support group isn't necessary. I have to say though, that picture cracks me up. I need to polish my googling skills.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I too wonder how Yen gets his pics;the dud is very funny

--- 帖子 #556 ---
RR....as a novice trader, I need all the help, support, and encouragement I can get. What I don't need at all is your smart mouth! If you have something helpful, supportive, or encouraging to say to me, bring it. If not, in the future please don't bother answering any of my posts!

--- 帖子 #557 ---
I totally agree....let's keep this thread going, if at all possible! I also stopped out this morning on the second E/J trade for a 100 pip loss, but made 50 pips last evening on the first trade. The second E/G trade that I'd been holding all week, closed out this morning at breakeven, but also made 50 pips on the first E/G trade earlier this week. Last nite I also took the G/J trade....closed out the first trade with +50 pips....second trade still running and is -44 pips, but AO and Stoch both still green, so reckon I'll just ride it out!

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Ok, I think I'll bring it. My EAs follow the system as posted. If you don't want them to trade for you that's fine, set SignalsOnly to true, and pick whatever signals you want (Mail, Alert, Sound). As a novice trader, I understand that you want--no--need whatever help you can get. So I'll pitch in my advice. There are three things which you need in trading: Bucks Brains Balls You need bucks to trade with, brains to make sure you make yoru bucks grow, and balls to make sure you don't panic, catch paralysis of analysis and prematurely get out, or lose big. Bears make money, bulls make money, and sheep get slaughtered. Traders with no balls are sheep, don't be a sheep. Most traders concentrate on the entry, and promptly get slaughtered. They have this notion that their entry is right, and the market is wrong. If you are still insistent on making money based on 'perfect entries' get out now, and go invest in real estate or something else, forex is not for you. The market is never ever wrong. All professional traders I've spoken with insist that knowing when to get out is the most important skill. It's not about being wrong or being right, it's about protecting your capital. Here is an exercise I give all new traders. It's a game of sorts which helps them train the most important skill of all, managing your trades. Toss a coin. Heads is long, tails is short. Decide whether or not the trade is a winner or a loser. Act accordingly. When a trade is closed, return to step 1. I can do this exercise and turn a profit--however small--within a week consistently. Some of the guys I trade with at RBS can do it in a day. Once you can do that, then you are a good trader. Then you can start focusing on your entries, and increasing your edge. If you can make money from 0 edge, then you can definitely make money with a positive edge. There's my advice. I only seek to give you the information, I'm not here to make you feel good about yourself. Every trader out there is out to get your lunch, to borrow from Ender's Game " If you can cheat, so can I. I won't let you beat me unfairly - I’ll beat you unfairly first. " --Ender Wiggin You need to beat them before they beat you.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
RR....thanks for "bringing it" with the good advice/info!

In case anyone happens to be still following this thread, tonite there was a clear signal....GBP/CHF Short....stoch and AO both red and price below 200 sma. Sure am curious about what happened to Bull101? Good system....good thread started on FF....then vanishes into thin air, never to be heard from again! Kind of a mystery!

--- 帖子 #561 ---
GBP/CHF short....both positions hit TP overnite for +150 pips.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Valid signal tonite....E/G long....bought in at .7980 Anyone besides me continuing to use this good system....with EA or manually?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi Im subscribed and read the posts but not using at mo Paulus

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I'm still using as a kind of guide.. And the system still giving good signals.. .

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Just wanted to say thanks to all of you that are hanging in here with this thread. Don't know if Bull101 will ever be back, but it really seems to be a good system....would be shame to let this thread die. Hang in there, gang!

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Me still around GRPip, I am very fan of Bull system...I admit I do not post too much as writting english is getting harder for me since I left ireland.... I have to thank Bull and RR and all the people colaborating in this tread... I hope Bull is only on holidays and we all hope he is back soon...... Good piping for the week guys...

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hey GRPip, You seem to be doing well with this system. I would say that you should take the bull by the horns and start making the calls untill Bull101 (IF HE) comes back. This thread does need someone to keep it alive and I nominate you. So make some calls and posts some charts, you the boss now! Good luck &amp; Good trading to you, AZ

--- 帖子 #568 ---
AZ....thanks for your encouragement, but I'm just a novice demo trader, not much experience at all....made a few good demo trades with this system and have confidence in it. Just want to keep this thread alive and kicking! Will be outa town till Wednesday and will give it some more thought....good luck this week!

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Keep it up GRPip.....

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I think there is no valid signal for this system today..

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Arrived back home late this afternoon....have decided that at least temporarily when I'm at home, I'll go ahead and post daily valid signals. I'll need everyone's help, consideration, patience, and cooperation to try work with this novice to try to keep this thread alive. Any suggestions, constructive criticism, helpful info, and comments are welcome. Let's just hope maybe old Bull101 will return soon! Today there are two valid system signals: EUR/CHF....LONG....1.6203 EUR/GBP....LONG....(Buy at your own discretion) I call this a weak signal because the stoch bar isn't very strong and AO bar is just barely showing green. To me this is a weak signal and prefer to wait for at least an hour or so to see if the AO is going to change to red. Reason....several times in the past months I've seen a weak AO or stoch bar like this one change colors during the first one or two hours. EUR/CHF seems like a good strong signal. As far as posting charts, be glad to if someone will tell me how to get it done. Good luck, gang....let's make some pips tonite! EUR/GBP....after more than an hour the signal still is green on both stoch/AO, so am going to BUY at .7927 If trading live, probably wouldn't have taken the trade....just curious.

No new valid signals for today. Still holding all yesterday's positions on EUR/CHF and EUR/GBP. All signals still green/long....in fact, yesterday's E/G that I called weak has an even stronger signal today and is currently in profit. So hang in there and let's see what happens with these two pairs. Good luck, gang!

Hey, gang....good valid long signal EUR/AUD tonite....I entered two positions long at 1.7028....hopefully good start for this week! Made a big blunder last week and accidentally deleted my ODL demo account that contained my still active trades on EUR/CHF and EUR/GBP. As I recall, I had already closed out first position on E/G at +50 pips and was getting ready to move second position to break even. Can't recall exactly what the EUR/CHF was doing at that time but looks like both pairs are still green and going up this week. So reckon everyone still holding those two pairs should hang on for this week's ride! Have a great and profitable week!

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Here is the EUR/AUD Long signal for tonite.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
This trade is really moving on! Already closed out first position on EUR/AUD at +50 pips profit and moved remaining position SL to breakeven. Was a bit late posting this signal tonite....hope everyone saw and got in on this one before I posted it....if not, sorry!

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Grpip thanks i start to check also

Second position of EUR/AUD Long closed out overnite at breakeven. Total trade profit = +50 pips

--- 帖子 #582 ---
hi all, juz found this thread, interesting method, lemme give it a try..

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Three trades tonite, gang....all short....been a while since we saw this many signals in one day! E/J SHORT....160.95 N/U SHORT....0.6969 A/J SHORT....93.86 Supporting signal charts below. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I have the same orders ok

--- 帖子 #585 ---
for: E/J SHORT....160.95 N/U SHORT....0.6969 A/J SHORT....93.86 3 profit of +50 breakeven at 50 for second position

--- 帖子 #586 ---
First position on all three trades made the TP last nite for a +150 pips. At this time everyone should be at breakeven on the second position of each trade and waiting on TP of 100 pips. So far, a really good start for the week of +200 pips. Those of you still holding trades from last week may have also added to this current weekly pip count. Someone care to report what happened with the trades from last weeK on the EUR/CHF and EUR/GBP?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I didn't entry on trades last week.. But this week this system is making me really happy.. Looking at the chart.. It seems tha eur/gbp went well and eur/chf not ... Actually eur/chf is quite good signal for tom.. what do you think ?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Tomorrow's signals/daily candle won't be available for about six hours yet. As for the EUR/CHF, look at the below chart and you can see that although both candles are red, the price is above the 200 SMA....so not a valid trade. To be a valid short trade, price has to be below 200 SMA. If the E/C price continues going down, it could turn into a valid signal tonite. Hope this explanation kinda clears things up for you....glad to have your participation.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Tks GRPip... just now I realize that I was using 200 EMA .. so the price was bellow

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Fantastic week so far, gang! Three remaining trade postions from last evening closed out today...two break evens and one did +100 pips....grand total for this week is +300 pips (if my math is correct). Two valid trades tonite: U/J Long....109.47 G/U Short....184.24 Charts below....good luck!

NO SIGNALS TODAY

--- 帖子 #594 ---
No new signals for today. Both positions of G/U hit TP overnite, resulting in a great +150 pips profit....total for week is +450 pips! Other yesterday's pick, U/J, is not doing too well. In one of this system's rare occasions, the U/J had a buy signal at opening, but changed to short during the first hour, I believe. This happens on occasion and Bull just normally lets the trade play out according to system rules....win or lose....hold on and let the chips fall where they may. Hope for a good signal or two tomorrow....good luck!

Hi All, I'm a long time lurker, sometime poster to this forum...&amp; FF is truly a "keeper". I've read &amp; have been following Bull101's thread here. I want to try back-testing with this method &amp; need help with download of the template (Ronald Raygun's) Can someone kindly either walk me through the process, or direct me to a place which patiently explains the download-onto-MT-4 process? I try &amp; try &amp; try. Never seems to take. There is always something the the computer, or MT-4 doesn't like. Or it just won't start-up. Always SOMETHING. Let's assume I have little computer savvy....which is true. Lets assume I have even less patience....which is true as well. Lets's also assume that I have the attention span of zero. And lets assume that I don't know what "protocol" (or any other computer term for that matter) means. Anyone can help me out.....certainly appreciated. Thanks Peter O.

Valid signal tonite....CAD/JPY Short....took two positions at 104.11 This trade seems to have two fairly weak red bars at this time, but price is under 200 SMA so qualifies as valid short/sell trade. Has been a really good week for this system....hope for a very profitable week's end. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Here is the CAD/JPY Short chart....should have been in the above post!

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Not trying to be negative here, but in checking the stats, there has been 39 trades, and the final tally is -391? A great winning percentage, but not so great on pips made?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
in this forum not every day the results were published we would like to know like you have the statistics.... which the source of data is? in my case this week it only begins a pursuit I specify alone it would contribute data of my bill demo being my own experience

--- 帖子 #608 ---
This is from the first page of the thread where you can check the stats Wins Losses Break Evens Win Rate Loss Rate Total Pips . 39 16 11 12 72% 28% (391) With 16 wins and 11 losses, why not just go for straight PIPS rather than all this buying 4 or 5 positions like the OZ system does? If I'm not wrong, the OZ system suffered HUGE drawdowns because of the way he took so many positions on each trade. If a system has such huge potential drawdowns, people cannot trade it without going crazy. The only way you can trade a system with tremendous drawdowns is either by using micr lots, or on paper.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Granted there was a time that almost all trades in a week hit stop and bull went low because we did not encourage him. This system has proven to be beneficial, but I think more filters will make more wonderful...food for tot. This week has been very fantastic. All trades has hit TP on both lots except UJ that is almost hitting SL. For today CADJPY both lots have hit TP ie +150 pips total. Better week ahead mates

--- 帖子 #610 ---
exactly from the first one page until today... all the trades was not published conclusion the statistic is incomplete to have a complete statistic it is needed to use the strategy all days for one month or 3 months

--- 帖子 #611 ---
There is nothing to keep this system from having 10 or more straight losses. When you're going 400 pips on each trade, that's 4000 pips lost. How many of you can with-stand that type of drawdown at a dollar a pip? all you can do with this kind of poor money management is to go micro pips, so 4000 pips would only mean a $40.00 loss. On the other hand, a 5000 pip gain would be $50.00. So, if you just want to play in the forex market, use this system on a micr account. Or, just demo trade it. IMHO, anyone using this type of trading on a real account will kill their account eventually. The )Z syustem suffered HUGE losses, and this tupe of wagering is nearly identical. yes, look at it after 3,4, or even 7 months, and see where your account is, and see if you can sleep at night. there;s much safer systems out there than this one. Might as well use a martingale system

--- 帖子 #612 ---
good information so we can run only demo and look the diference .....good wind and good sea

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Why not try reading the system rules on Bull101's Post #1! To paraphrase: "Take two buy or sell positions on each trade with SL of 100 pips on each....on first position set TP of 50....second position TP of 100." When first position TP of 50 is reached, close out that position and set SL to breakeven on remaining second position." So the very most you can lose total if the trade goes completely sour is 200 pips ($2.00, $20, or $200)....not 4000 pips or $4000! Most profit per trade is 150 pips. My suggestion to you is find yourself another safer system and find somewhere else to spread your negativity. Oh....and by the way....have a great day!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Great week, gang!! CAD/JPY closed out overnite with +150 pips profit....grand total for this week's trades is +600 pips! Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I do the same thing; thankfully we are not shot by firing squad at sunrise. And many thanks to the vets that have put up with my questions through the year. p

--- 帖子 #616 ---
The results on page 1 only go to the end of July. From June 18 to June 24, there was a 1400 PIP drawdown, and one of those days in June, two trades were made that lost 400 PIPS. From July 21 to July 29, there was a 750 PIP drawdown. Why risk such drawdowns by doing this whole thing of making two separate trades where your gain is 150 pips against a potential loss of 200? With that sort of "money management" this very same trading system LOST 391 PIPS with a 72% win ratio! While the system itself is good with 16 wins and 11 losses, the money management part of it needs some serious work.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Why split trades? One trade, fixed TP, fixed SL. Don't maximize pips, maximize winning trades.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I see some potentials in this system though i dnt really agree with the money management aspect of it.i have been demo testing this system and i hav gained some pips though i lost some due to the fact that i disobeyed the rules but wenever i obeyed the rules,i gained.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
when I check out ur prev posts...I have noticed that u were an ex-kantor? Glad to know that u r talking/worrying about the DD occurs during trade... Great.. sonic

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi Sonic, I'm also an avid follower of your thread. I invested many hours studying the Kantor system, and the number ONE concern for me was the drawdowns. I was caught in the GBP/JPY meltdown, and learned a very hard lesson there. That lesson is that, no matter what indicators or fibs or fundamentals you may use, there is no way you can predict just how high a pair may rise or fall. Just when you think there's a top or bottom, a new top or bottom comes. After you swear that's it...that it can't go up or down any further, it does. That's how accounts are wiped. This one had a 1400 PIP drawdown just last month. What if there were a few wins, and then another drawdown of 2400 PIPS? How many here can withstand that unless you're doing micro lots. And, if you're doing micro lots, you don't really gain much when you make those 1000 pip gains. I don't know how to make indicators or anything. But, i know from experience that the number one thing you must do in forex is to not get wiped out by not using stop losses. With all due respect to Brian, the inventor of the Kantor system, not using stops is a recipe for disaster. Another recipe for disaster is using a system that has bad money management where you're going for 150 and risking 200. Yes, you're gonna have those months where you do just great. The months to plan for are the ones where you lose 2000 pips or even more. A win percentage of over 70%, and you lose money? Give me a break. Even someone with zero experience in forex can see there's something wrong with that picture.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
u should say that out..in the kantor thread...buddy..anyway they are gone now... -1400 pips can make me out of the forex business.... Recently, I posted nice pdf document regarding about trading mentality in my journal..go read it if u have time buddy... sonic

Hey, gang....hope everyone is having a good weekend! Valid signal today....EUR/CHF Long....opened two positions at 1.6155....stoch looks kinda weak, but according to system rules it is valid. Have a great and profitable Labor Day!

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Well, as you can see on the chart attachments below, the weak green long stoch did turn red during the first hour or so of today's session. This is a fairly uncommon occurance, but this is the second time in the last two weeks. I bought both positions, so reckon I'll just ride it out and see what happens. Sometimes when we have a valid buy/sell signal with one or both candles weak, it might pay to just wait until the signal has been valid for at least an hour. What do ya'll think about this problem? Some time ago after this system sustained some big loses, Bull made a change in this system. He decided to start putting a 100 pip TP on the second position instead of just letting it run on trying for a possible 150-250 pips. Will some of you veteran traders take a look this week and let us know if the conditions have changed and we can go back to letting the second position just run?

--- 帖子 #624 ---
My brokers time is GMT+2,so i did not see a valid signal for the EUR/CHF.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Thanks Grpip for supporting this interestinf thread Please, anybody is earning money with this system? Regards.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Think most are still demoing this system at the present. I have made and lost some demo money with this system....think the jury is still out on whether it will be profitable long term.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
No valid signals for today....still holding yesterday's two positions EUR/CHF, but about -85 pips....will hold until SL or TP hit on both positions. Have a great week!

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hey, gang! Took a big hit today as both EUR/CHF trades hit SL for a -200 pip loss....not a good start for September. But the trade had a weak green stoch bar and turned red within the first hour and it was downhill from there. Anyway, valid strong sell signal tonite on the AUD/CAD....price .8900....both stoch and AO have good strong red bars and price well below 200 SMA....see below chart. Good luck....hopefully we can recover some of those lost pips on this trade!

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Grip, what about this? i have this on my platform. is this valid for a buy?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
GRPip and sorsurus, I saw both of your signals for trades tonight and didn't see either of those signals on my broker. I figured out why this is happening. I know Bull recommends using ODL Demo for signals but ODL has a Sunday candle which on your charts will only represent a partial day trading. Sunday candles also affect your indicators, in my opinion, in a negative way. I would try to find a demo account that does not have a Sunday candle. I know Alpari does not have a Sunday candle and that is what I use and their daily candle begins at 6pm EST. I'm pretty sure FXDD does not have a Sunday candle either but I don't know what time their daily candle starts. Here are the 4 signals I got for tonight which as of right now are up over 300 pips total. Short AUDUSD @ .8370 Buy EURAUD @ 1.7352 Short NZDUSD @ .6869 Buy EURNZD @ 2.1141 Here are my charts for the two signals you guys mentioned.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
sosurus....sorry I'm just now getting back online...but you didn't miss a trade! My ODL USD/CHF chart is different from your chart....take a look! It shows the valid buy signal to be yesterday, not today. But yesterday, that buy signal wasn't there. Hope you understand what I'm trying to say here! 8^)

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Eclectic Joe....glad you're having a good run of pips today! Anyway, I don't claim to be a forex professional, just a novice who likes trading Bull's simple system and hope to be profitable live trading with it in the future. Bull said ODL was the best for his system, so reckon that's what I'll use. Anyone else is free to use any broker they choose, of course, but we really all need to be on the same page so we can compare apples to apples, not apples to oranges.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Eclectic Joe quote: " I know Alpari does not have a Sunday candle and that is what I use and their daily candle begins at 6pm EST. I'm pretty sure FXDD does not have a Sunday candle either but I don't know what time their daily candle starts." Eclectic Joe....I didn't mean to sound so inflexible in my above answer to you! I'm just a creature of habit and don't like change....a lifetime of that way of thinking is so darn hard to change. After I posted my answer to you, I was sitting here thinking.....he's up over 300 pips and I'm sitting here with +50. Something's wrong with that scenerio!! 8^) So E. Joe, again showing my ignorance, will you explain to me and others who don't know, what is the Sunday candle thing on ODL? All I know is that Bull said that ODL opens their trading week on Sunday evening, 7 p.m., Central Daylite Time, USA.....and he posted his trades every day within minutes after that time. When does your trading week start with Alpari and how does that make a difference with our indicators? Actually, if Alpari has better and truer signals, I'm not opposed at all to doing an Alpari demo. Please help me and others here to understand?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Please, anyoone has tested the 4 hours version of this system?

--- 帖子 #635 ---
hahaha.....pity on me. no wonder i always have a different setup from yours. already downloaded a new platform from odl. will use it for this technique. thanks for the clarification. lets pipping!

--- 帖子 #636 ---
No new valid signals today. Still holding second trade AUD/CAD Long currently at +41 pips.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
In all honesty I don’t know why some brokers created a Sunday candle and ODL is not the only broker that has a Sunday candle. I have seen forex mentioned as a 24/7 market but in actuality forex is a 24/5 market. So for a week of trading you should only have 5 candles but with some brokers you will have 6. And that extra candle will throw indicators off because Sunday night you are only getting partial data and Monday you will only get partial data. For me to explain this better I will use Eastern time to make this make sense. All these numbers are fictitious and I’m just going to use a long movement in pips. Now I know no one ever uses a 6 day moving average but I will use it to show the difference. The opening price will be 1.0000. ODL (broker for example only, since they have a Sunday candle) Sunday candle (6pm-11:59am) 15 pips, closing price 1.0015 Monday candle (12:00am-5:59pm) 100 pips, closing price 1.0115 Tuesday candle (6:00pm-5:59pm) 120 pips, closing price 1.0235 Wednesday candle (6:00pm-5:59pm) 125 pips, closing price 1.0360 Thursday candle (6:00pm-5:59pm) 130 pips, closing price 1.0470 Friday candle (6:00pm-5:59pm) 135 pips, closing price 1.0605 Alpari (broker for example only, since they do not have a Sunday candle) Previous Friday candle (6:00pm(Thursday)-5:59pm(Friday)) 110 pips (just to show how it will change an indicator), closing price 1.0005 No Sunday candle Monday candle (6:00pm(Sunday)-5:59pm(Monday)) 115 pips, closing price 1.0115 Tuesday candle (6:00pm(Monday)-5:59pm(Tuesday)) 120 pips, closing price 1.0235 Wednesday candle (6:00pm(Tuesday)-5:59pm(Wednesday)) 125 pips, closing price 1.0360 Thursday candle (6:00pm(Wednesday)-5:59pm(Thursday)) 130 pips, closing price 1.0470 Friday candle (6:00pm(Thursday)-5:59pm(Friday)) 135 pips, closing price 1.0605 ODL at the close of Friday will have a 6 day SMA of 1.0300 Alpari at the close of Friday will have a 6 day SMA of 1.2983 Now this does not seem like much here when you look at it (17 pips) but in the long run that extra candle will add up. The AO Oscillator is based on a 5 day and 34 day simple moving average. So just take for example the 5 day moving average over a year and that would be almost a 1200 pip difference on the 5 day moving average with that extra candle. All indicators are based on price (close, open, median, whatever you choose), so you can see how that price difference will change the indicators. I hope this made sense to everyone, if not, ask questions, and I will try to make better sense of it all. Golum and everyone about Bulls 4 hour strategy. Two weeks ago I found both his 4 hour strategy and daily strategy. I use the AO, the Stoch histogram, and the Advanced ADX indicator from his 4 hour strategy and applied it to the daily charts. Whenever all three colors line up and price above/below the MA, I trade in that direction. Now back to the trades I took yesterday. If I would have followed Bulls’ money management strategy, all 4 trades would have hit the 50 and 100 pip profit, but I have different money management, so all the trades are still open, and in profit. I will share the money management strategy tomorrow if you would like. I was also thinking that if you use this strategy on the daily charts, following Bulls’ money management strategy, and you take profits, then moving down to the 4 hour charts to re-enter when the 4 hour chart matches the trend of the daily chart. Anyone interested in seeing if this would work? I’m adding this, not to gloat, but from what I have seen, and also looking back on historical data, entries and exit, I think this is a very good system. I started a new demo account on 8/19 just to try this system and since then have made 617 pips, lost 192 pips, and have 1236 pips floating. I want to keep this thread alive and get everyone’s experience with it.

Hey, gang....no valid signals tonite. Those of you that held on to the second position of the AUD/CAD Short trade saw it close out today hitting the +100 pip TF....so that trade did +150 pips this week. If any decided to just let that second position run and you took the position at around .8900, then you are at +180 pips with still a good strong sell signal. Even if this trade is still going strong tomorrow morning, might wanna think about closing it out everything before the NFP announcement....just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Eclectic Joe....very interesting info you have shared with us....don't understand about the Sunday candle problem, but I don't have to. I just need to know what broker to use....what time that broker starts their week....and what indicators I need to use.....then I'm off to the races....or the poorhouse! 8^) I would like you to explain more about your MM for this system. Speaking for myself, I'd like to explore your "modified" Trendillator Daily System a little further and get more info about your MM strategy. I already have an Alpari MT4 demo account open and I'll put the system indicators....AO, Stoch, and Advanced ADX....on there and be ready to trade next week. Does Alpari open their week in U.S.A. on Sunday at 5 p.m. Central Daylite Time?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Grpip and Golum, Well since I had a heck of a day today, and today is the last day of trading for the week and it will take a little while to explain the money management part of this system or any system for that matter, I will work on it this weekend and post it well before Sunday opening. Grpip, You are right. There weren't any new trades today. And AUDCAD is still rolling!!! I know you said you are a creature of habit but I hate to hear that you don't want to understand because that is how I learned from my losses and how to better my winning percentage. My money management strategy changed because of ONE trade that got stopped out, I shorted the trade and it has definitely shorted, but if I knew then what I knew now about stop losses and gave the trade room to "breathe", I would be sitting on a 1200 pip profit just from that trade alone. The poorhouse??? Well I hope you are only demo trading this system for now, because I will demo a system for AT LEAST 6 months before I decide if it performs well enough or not to trade live. And the opening will begin at 5pm Sunday your time. I added the chart to show where I'm at with all my trades. I also added the template I'm currently using. Download the template to C:\program files\Metatrader-("broker name")\templates and then open Metatrader and apply it to all your charts. You must have all the the indicators in your indicator folder (Stoch histogram (Trend Finder 4 hour thread by Bull101, first post), AO (standard with MT), Advanced ADX (Trend Finder 4hour thread by Bull101, first post), ATR (standard with MT). I'm off. Have a good weekend and I will talk to you all soon.

Eclectic Joe....guess you misunderstood me....I do want to learn, I just didn't understand your explanation of the "Sunday Candle Effect" and really didn't think it was that important for me to put in a lot of time trying understand....just need to follow directions and execute the plan. As for proper MM, I understand the importance and will make every effort to educate and inform myself about your particular MM strategy....looking forward to your info. Thanks for including your chart and template. And no, I'm not trading live.....was only joking....have been demoing and trying out various systems for about six months. Will have my Alpari MT4 loaded with your template and be ready to go Sunday evening at 5 p.m. Will you start posting the signals for your modified system on Alpari? I will continue posting signals for Bull's regular system on ODL.

I started looking into this a while ago when I started running into problems with stops always getting hit, but looking back at the candle I took the trade on, most of the time the candle was in the direction of the trade I took. I read a couple of books recently and I also remember a thread of here that was using ATR (Average True Range) for their stops. ATR does not tell you which direction the currency pair is going, only the degree of movement or volatility the pair has averaged over a certain number of days. So I added ATR to Bull’s already great setup for entries and I set it to 13 days to match up with the ADX setting he uses. I also overlayed a 1 day ATR to keep an eye on where the pair is starting to become more volatile than the recent 13 day average. To understand the ATR (13 days in this case) values for stop loss and how they work against a fixed number stop loss, on all pairs that DO NOT have JPY in the currency pair, look at the last 3 numbers. For all pairs that DO have JPY in the currency pair, look at the first three numbers. These numbers are the recent average of pips that the pair is moving in a day. I just took a look at my charts and all the ATRs are greater than the 100 pip fixed stop loss that Bull recommends. If you look at the EURNZD chart I attached and the highlighted candle, notice the long tail on what is a long entry according the rules. That pair is trading roughly around 239 pips a day per the ATR value, which means, the trade could first move against you 100 pips from the opening price and then turn around and gain 139 pips from the opening price. The entry price was around 2.1141 and the low for the day on that candle is 2.1037. Now if during the trading day, the trading moved against you first to that low of 2.1037 before it reversed during the day to the close it made, you would have been stopped out. So what I have been learning from my experience so far is to use a fixed stop loss of 2xATR because all the pairs have a different volatility. Now on some of the pairs, that can be upwards of 500 pips and most around 200-300 pips and that is a lot of pips. For demo trading this is no problem because you are only seeing how well the system works. Open a demo account with a high starting capital and only trade with 0.1 lots so that you can take all the trades that meet the entry criteria and not have any margin calls to properly evaluate the system. If you decide to use this way of setting stop loss on live trading, use must learn about position sizing and trading the right amount of lots so that if this trade does go against you that many pips, that you still will not risk more than 2% of your account. I’m not going to go into position sizing here, and if you want to learn more about it, try googling it or send me a PM and I know a couple of good books that talk about it. So for demoing this system, take all the trades just after the candle opens and all three indicators finally are all the same color and meet the criteria of being above or below the MA, just like Bull explains it. After taking the trade, take the ATR (13) value as it shows in the indicator window and multiply that times 2. Subtract that from your entry price if you went long or add it the entry price if you went short. That will be your absolute stop loss. Write that stop loss down on paper or if you want to add a line on your chart with that price, but do not put that stop loss value in Metatrader or whatever trading platform you use. The reason I say do not put the stop loss into the computer to have it automatically closed out is that while wicks are very important to the formation of a candle and for candle type charting, they also represent what I call “noise” on daily trading. For me, entries, stop loss, and exit are based on the bodies of the candle (open and close). Close out the trade for a loss if the OPENING PRICE at the opening of the candle is above or below, depending on long or short, the stop loss price you calculated. Other than that let the trades run until at the opening of the candle, the AO or ADX has switched colors opposite your trade and then exit the trade. Also use this exit strategy for trades that are in loss even if they have not hit the stop loss you calculated. From what I see, re-entries of the current trend are possible when the Stochs and AO changed color back to the current trend. Also I forgot to add the candle time indicator that I have on my charts. So throw that in the indicator folder and re-open MT. I just use that because for some reason some charts don’t change to the new day and exactly 6pm EDT (5pmCDT). Sometimes they take a few minutes, so just make sure that the candle time says over 1400 minutes to go when you are looking for trade to go into or to exit. I will post what trades I took and when I exited. I always enter or exit trades within the first half hour of candle opening. And that does sound like a good idea about also using ODL to see if and what it does truly matter. Other than that, I can’t think of anything else at this time. Any questions just ask.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi everybody, This is my first time following this strategy, please can somebody tell my if this is a valid signal?. I'll appreciate your assistance. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I'd be careful. Gaps generally retrace until they are closed. I'd wait for the monday candle to close.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Bull....welcome aboard! Your U/J signal would be a valid long trade for this system....if it were on the Monday candle....not Sunday candle. This system was designed to trade with the ODL broker, beginning on Daily candle which opens with ODL at 7 p.m. each trading day. So yes, you are looking at the trade correctly....price above 200 SMA with stoch and AO both green. You're on the right track....just make sure you're on an ODL demo and check all pairs again tonite after 7 p.m. Central Daylite Time. Actually, signals have been know occasionally to change during the first hour of trading. So personally, I've decided that unless the AO and Stoch both have really strong signals, not just green or red dots, I'm just going to wait to take the trade until at least 30-45 minutes into the session....of course you can experiment and find whatever works for you. If you have more questions, just ask....will help if I can. Good luck!

Glad to see you here Bull. We might have to call you "lil Bull" though since "Big Bull" started the thread. GRPip is right about how quick the colors can change. I exited an AUDUSD trade I had because when the candle first opened it was opposite my trade and within 30 mins it had changed back to going with my trade. Well don't forget everyone, GRPip and I are seeing if there are any differences in ODL signals and Alpari signals. I'm using Alpari. New Trades Long CADCHF at 1.0574 Closed Trades Opened short GBPUSD on 8/27/08 @ 1.8376, closed 9/8/08 @ 1.7872 (AO change) 504 pips Opened short AUDUSD on 9/3/08 @ .8370, closed 9/8/08 @ .8328 (AO change) 42 pips Opened long EURAUD on 9/3/08 @ 1.7352, closed 9/8/08 @ 1.7261 (AO change) -91 pips Good luck and talk to you everyone tomorrow

No new valid signals on ODL....no open trades....good luck this week!

Hi GRPip &amp; ElectriJoe, I want to thank both of you for your comments and explanations. I'll try to follow and test this strategy.

There are four basic kinds of gaps: 1.common gaps 2.breakaway gaps 3.runaway gaps 4.exhaustion gaps If you ever wondered what causes gaps in price charts and what they mean? http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...nd_gap_analysi Hope this helps LR

--- 帖子 #652 ---
FOR Eclectic JOE: firstly thanks for sharing so much on this thread. SUNDAY CANDLE information, your template, ATR stoploss strategy etc. 1. Why use the 3xMA's you do from your template? Is not the SMA200 enough?Please kindly explain. 2. Why ise ATR=1 pverlayed on ATR=13? Please explain the reason. 3. I think Adv ADR indicator from 4h strategy on daily charts is great idea. I have been testing on my charts for a while. 4. Does one enter the trade at the EOD close and open of the next day? If yes, on the Alpari demo platform (NO SUNDAY CANDLE) one should wait till tomorrow. For GRPip: thanks for your committment on this strategy and daily reporting of trades. Greatly appreciated to both of you. LR

--- 帖子 #653 ---
FOR BULL: Thanks for sharing your chart. I am using the trend finder signal indicator too from the paperclip onthis thread. 1. How to you change the position of this information from thwe left to the right of the chart? 2. How does your indicator calculate &amp;)% of the ATR=14 in terms of pips and display it on the left of the chart? 3. What do the UP arrows indicate on your chart? 4. What does the AESTF stand for in the inputs of this indicator? Thanks, LR

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi Irathi Here you're the indicators that I'm using and the Template. Have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Thanks a lot Bull for YOUR indis and tpl. Could you point to the latest rules YOU are using? Thanks Forex37

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi Forex37 I just began to test this strategy this week, following the original rules: Long Entry Criteria: 1. Price is above the 200sma. 2. The Awesome Oscillator has changed to green. 3. The Stochastic Histogram has changed to green. Short Entry Criteria: 1. Price is Below the 200sma. 2. The Awesome Oscillator has changed to red. 3. The Stochastic Histogram has changed to red. And for real Short Entry Point you must need a Buy Entry point as a last signal (and viceversa), in other words if your last signal was a Short and then (for example) AO turned green and then in a couples candles change again to red, this isn't a valid signal because the las Valid Signal was a SHORT and now is like a "new short" then this is a invalid signal. This strategy is similar to OZ system, but with a "little" change using AO. This a big difference, because if you read the origin of AO, AC and all indicators of Bill Williams and his Chaos Theory, the only indicator that give you a signal is the AO, this is the reason because I think that this is a better strategy. I'll test forward and I'll try to show here my experience for everybody. Bull PS. Sorry for any mistake, English isn't my first language.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Bull, Thanks for your quick and speedy reply. To clear up, just 3 questions: 1. What about broker setting ( no sunday cande - start 0.00 gmt?) for valid signals? 2. Trading only after close of signal candle, id if candle SWITCHING color compared to a candle before ? Trade immediateley or after close of this? 3. ANy hints concerning TP /SL ? By the way - english isn`t my first language either, not even my second. Best wishes and thanks FOrex 37 p.s. Anybody still applying the 4hr version ( Trendfinder 4hr)

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hi Forex37 I'll try to answer your questions. It's true, you must to avoid any signal generated by Sunday candle. Place the Trade ONLY after a bar close, you have (more or less) 10 minutes to place your trade after the candle is closed and you're sure that you've a valid signal. I'm following the originals rules, that mind First Target Profit at 50 pips, second at 100, when you close the first TP you must to move your SL to break even. And regarding the inicial SL is 50 pips. Hope that can help you. BTW, today we don't have a valid signal (using ODL as Broker, because they began a daily candle at 00:00 GMT) Bull

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Thanks so much BULL. I love the AO signal and ATR pips indicators LR

It's not about entrances that make money but exits!!! As a rule of thumb Cut your losses short, let your profits run. With random generated signals one can make money with MM. I stopped visiting FF regularly, I used to read here and there for so many hours. At the end I wasb't making money. Now I trade with no indicators, only price action and my eyes as a leading indicator. lol. (p^^q)

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hey lrathi and some of the new people who have joined us. 1. I apologize to everyone. I was doing some experimenting with some MA's on this system and forgot to erase them when I uploaded the template. I have attached the new template on this post, which only has the 200 SMA, and will update the old post so people will look here instead. I will add though, I am testing a 50SMA with this system and for people who like to experiment, it probably would be worth looking into. The 50SMA seems to line up a lot with the Advanced ADX indicator. 2. Well since forex has no "central exchange," like most markets around the world, I believe any volume or volume related indicator on forex trading platforms are useless. You are only getting volume information from your broker, not all brokers combined. I've read different things about falling volumes and rising volumes with comparison to price action and the possibilities it can have with trend continuation after consolidation, reversals, etc. Since ATR tells us the volatility of a current pair, I overlayed an ATR(1) over the ATR(13) to watch for when daily volatilites have been higher than average, which usually means volume is increasing or consistently below the average, which means volume is either holding steady or decreasing. Increases in volatility can give signs of a good trading opportunity, but it can also be a warning to exit the trade. So it's something I like to keep an eye on. Read more about volumes combined with price movements and that will help also. It can give you an understanding about trader mentality, possible times when traders are taking profits, traders are the wrong side are cutting their losses, and possibilites of when there just aren't enough sellers to keep the price going down or buyers to keep the price going up. 3. I totally agree with you using the Advance ADX indicator with the Stoch and AO setup on the daily. That way you have a better chance of a winning trade because you are trading with the trend. 4. You only enter within the first 15 mins and I would say no more than 30 mins after the OPENING of the candle. Alpari does not have a Sunday candle, but ODL does. Alpari's candles open at 6pm EDT. GRPip is our resident ODL expert, so you could check with him about what time the Monday candle opens on ODL.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Sorry, gang....no valid signals again today on the Bull101 Original System....maybe tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #663 ---
EJ....this novice appreciates the compliment, but I'm no expert about anything pertaining to forex! As for ODL, I do know that their daily candle opens each trading day at 7 p.m. CDT (Central Daylite Time) . So Monday daily opens at 7 p.m. Sunday evening.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Nothing on Alpari on the Original System either. Yesterday's long on CADCHF on Original System 1st lot - 50 pips 2nd lot- breakeven

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Two valid signals tonite on Bull101 Original System-ODL USD/CAD....Long....entry price 1.0699 CAD/JPY....Short....entry price 100.12 Still time to get in these trades....won't lose but a few pips.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hi GRPip, yes I'm also in in both new signals... Will what going on...

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Thanks for the indicators, nice system..^_^..

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Sorry, gang....AO changed colors from green to red in the second hour on USD/CAD....guess I'll hang in to see what happens. Hate this behavior....seems to be the big weakness of this system! 8^( And this time during the first hour of trading, both AO and Stoch were reasonably strong. Go figger!!

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I had only one of those trades on the Original System last night on Alpari. At open the USDCAD had a Green Stoch and Red AO. I did have the CADJPY trade though. CADJPY....Short....entry 99.51 and the stop loss got hit overnight for 2 lots at -100 pips. GRPip... do you still have the AUDCAD short trade that you took the other day still running? You should be up a little over 300 pips right now if I remember correctly you taking the trade around .8900 I know you have seen this GRPip and for others also. Sometimes the Stoch Histogram indicator will have red and green bars in it the same day. The color changes on the histogram when the signal line on the Full Stochs crosses the 50 line. So if the signal line starts above or below 50 and crosses during the day, you will have both colors show up on the histogram. The only way to get rid of this is to re-apply the template to the chart and it will show you the updated color of the histogram. If you re-apply the template you will lose all trendlines, fib lines, or any other other objects you have on there, so if you have any lines on there, save the template specifically for that chart, and then re-apply that specific template. I would recommend re-applying the template just prior to the open of the candle if you have the two color histogram on one candle to make sure you are entering the trade properly.

Eclectic Joe....thanks for your update and info! On the AUD/CAD trade I took last week on 9/3, the system worked like a charm! Closed out both trades that evening/next day with +150 pips profit! I'm still in the CAD/JPY short trade....first position closed out at +50 pips....2nd position now at breakeven and currently at +18 pips.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
No new valid trades tonite. Update....overnite the CAD/JPY Short closed out 1st position for +50 pips....moved the 2nd position to breakeven....currently at 7:51 p.m. CDT the 2nd trade is at +10 pips. The USD/CAD Long trade from last night is still moving up with another good strong green Stoch and AO tonite....presently at +48 pips.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hi everybody, Last to trades, Long in UsdCad &amp; Short in CadJpy closed with the second target profit +100. Very good trades. We're waiting for new signal tonight..

--- 帖子 #673 ---
No new valid signals tonite, so guess this closes out the week for this system. Some of you may think there are a couple valid trades on the charts tonite. But just examine the charts a little closer and you will see that strictly according to Bull101 System rules there are no valid trades. As for the trades we were holding last nite, the 2nd position CAD/JPY closed out at breakeven. USD/CAD....1st position closed out at +50 pips....2nd position closed at breakeven. Some of you may not have been stopped out due to the price/time you got in on the trades. For me, two trades and +100 pips for the week....not too bad....hope next week will be better!

--- 帖子 #674 ---
No new valid signals today....maybe tomorrow....hope everyone had a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #675 ---
One valid signal for today....no hold overs from last week. EUR/CHF....Short....good strong red sell signals on Stoch/AO and price well below 200 SMA....my price 1.5865. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #676 ---
EUR/CHF....Short.... 1st lot hit TP

--- 帖子 #677 ---
No new valid signals for today. Yestedays EUR/CHF hit the TP on both positions....+150 pips....good week so far!

The stats on your site seems to be overall negative even though the number of winning trades is quite high. The losing trades seem to create a huge dent in your account.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Not my stats....not my site....not my account! This system/website was designed/setup/posted here by a dude named Bull101. He disappeared around Aug. 1....hasn't been heard from since. I and several other traders think this is a good and potentially profitable system. So, at some urging from others, I decided to just try to keep this thread going. I try to post every day about valid signals, no valid signals, ongoing trades, etc. We use ODL broker for our demo trading and their daily session starts at 7 p.m. Central Daylite Time....usually I get the info posted sometime between 7-8 p.m. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Two new valid signals tonite. AUD/USD....short.... .7921(my price) AUD/CAD....short.... .8472 (my price) Both these trades have fairly strong AO and Stochs. There is a weak short signal on the GBP/CHF....take it if you want, but I prefer to watch and wait a while on this one to see if the red AO/Stoch bars get stronger or maybe even change color and reverse. If the bars get stronger later, then I will probably take a chance. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Here are the two charts for tonites valid signals.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Here is the weak GBP/CHF short trade signal chart to which I was referring in the above post. Notice how short the red bars are, especially on the stoch histogram. With this system these weak bars can/will sometimes change from red to green during the first hour or so of trading. Even though I may miss pips by getting in the trade later, I prefer to wait till the color gets stronger and stabilizes.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Not going to gamble with GBP/CHF....red bars still weak after two hours into session. If you like gambling....go for it!

--- 帖子 #684 ---
For me, I won't gamble for GBPCHF since our 2 position opened are rocking some pips already

--- 帖子 #685 ---
No valid signals tonite....as of yet. The U/J could later develope into a valid long. At this time has strong green AO and price is just above 200 SMA. Stoch is green but almost takes a microscope to see it, so won't take it at this time. Will continue to watch this pair for a while and will post here if I enter the trade. Both AUD/USD and AUD/CAD from yesterday quickly closed out first positions for +50 pips each. Then not long afterward, the second positions on both hit breakeven SL....total +100 pips for the two trades. Good week....total +250 pips....have a great weekend!

Hi man! I'm curious how did you enter the trade AUD/USD SHORT at price 0.7921. The opening price is 0.7894 and if you took that price short the market reached only as law as 0.7863 before turning around and becoming a -100 pips loss trade. your AO candle became red after the price moved up from opening to 0.7921 and then you enetered? that sounds strange. plz explain it . Something i dont understand about risk management here. the man who published this system said to close the first one +50 pips and second +100 pips but the next post he said he has some big winners until AO changes colors . so i dont understand what about the second trade, close it +100 or let it run. i think what makes this system really profitable is those big winners otherwise the R/R ratio is not good at all , not even 1:1. so can someone tell me what did the author meant here?

Hunter....first of all, you have to understand that I'm almost a complete novice to forex trading. To be perfectly honest, I really don't know how I got in that A/U short trade. If I hadn't screwed up my ODL Account History today....wiped it out completely....I could show you that I actually made that trade. Sorry! As for your second question, when Bull101 first started this thread, when the trades reached +50 pips, he closed the 1st trade, moved the SL on both trades to breakeven, then just let the 2nd position run until either the Stoch or AO changed color. Then after some bad loses, he came up with the plan to limit the 2nd trade TP to +100 pips. He did always specify to risk only 3% of balance on any trade. If any experienced traders here think we can again safely let the 2nd trade run till a bar changes color, I'll be glad to again try trading like that. Anyone got an opinion?

Don't see any valid signals tonite for this system....better luck tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Again....no valid signals for today!

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Don't know what's going on with the forex market, but there are no valid signals again tonite....none so far this week! Anyone have a clue as to why?

Forex is testing our patience (as usual)

--- 帖子 #694 ---
it's not surprising because we are after 2 months of strong trend for the dollar. last week was very weak for the dollar but still he is above the 200 sma against all the other currencies. so we will have to wait for the trend to continue or ths price to cross the sma

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Yeh It's been boring to watch.. but at least we aren't loosing... heheh

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Still boring tonite....no signals! Maybe tomorrow?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Volatility has dropped a lot this week. I wonder what happened.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
This week is a total bust....no valid signals tonite....none for the week! Until this financial crisis has some sort of resolution, don't think the currency market is going to move much. Have a great weekend....we'll worry more about forex next week!

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hi GRPip, Thank you, have a nice weekend you too. Next week will be better week for us.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
EUR/AUD Long and AUD/CAD Short are two valid signals for sunday open. Cad looks better than EUR so i'm gonna take this one.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
You'll have to excuse my ignorance, but which broker charts are you looking at? This system was designed to use the ODL broker who doesn't have a Sunday candle and whose week doesn't even start until 7 p.m. on Sunday evening, U.S.A., Central Daylite Time. Valid signals for this system only occur during the first few minutes to first hour of daily candle opening. So the earliest time there could be a valid signal for this system is between 7-8 p.m. this coming Sunday nite, Sept. 28. Also today is Friday....which broker would be showing a daily Sunday candle at this time? Am I missing something here? If so, please feel free to enlighten me!

--- 帖子 #702 ---
NIce work you are doing keeping alive this tread... Keep it up man...

--- 帖子 #703 ---
The friday daily candle closed as a sell signal , so you can check the daily open of sunday and tell us all there is a signal and you can assume the chart wont open up with a 200 pips gap to the upside and the signal would remain.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I see the point you're trying to make....but your broker is IBFX....ODL charts do not show your Friday signals. Even if they did, don't think it'd have anything to do with Sunday evening opening signals. Think IBFX opens at 5 p.m. daily, but not sure. Keep checking signals on IBFX and keep us informed....would very much like to use IBFX because live micro-accounts are available with opening deposits of $250, I believe. ODL requires $2000 to open a live account!

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Dude, your way of thinking is too mechanical , we are not computers and there is no such a big difference between brokers, you have to use your judgement as trader before making the trade. i rest asure you will get the same signal sunday morning from all brokers and the trade looked good to me- aus dollar is weak and the daily formation is really bearish (two daily inside bars broken to the downside) , it looks like a good trade anyway. Take a look at another "signal" from EUR/CHF , no way im gonna take this one although both indicators turned red. the daily candle formed a bullish hammer so no reason to take a short position even if it will turn out to be a good trade. Nothing better than using your judgement as a trader.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hunter....you may be correct that I'm too mechanical....probably am. But the way I see it....Bull101 introduced this system and started this thread to keep his system going. I've seen a lot of system threads start on FF and get many people posting and stating their own ideas of how this or that system should be changed. Presto....in 2-3 months the thread doesn't even resemble the system that was introduced in the beginning....and maybe it's still not any more successful. The thread just eventually dies out from lack of interest and another possibly good system bites the dust! I've seen this system work like a charm and also seen it fail miserably. But as a novice trader, I like it's simplicity and so far I haven't found anything that works any better. So will be looking for valid signals on my ODL charts after 7 p.m. CDT! tomorrow evening. But until this USA/worldwide financial crisis is resolved to some extent, I don't think trading is going to be very profitable on anybody's system. Just my 2 pips worth!

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Hope everyone had a great weekend! Tonite is just a continuation of last week's sick forex market....not much movement....no valid signals.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
100 pips reached in AUD/CAD short. I leave 20% of the position on BE and will go out with the PSAR. Catching big moves of 300-400 pips is what makes this system profitable in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Finally....in spite of the horrible worldwide financial situation, tonite we have two valid signals for this system. USD/JPY....Short....104.30 (price @ 7:07 p.m CDT) USD/CAD....Long....1.0471 (price 7:09 p.m. CDT) Both price signals seem to be strong and clearly well above or below the 200 SMA. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #710 ---
USDJPY hit 50 TP set SL to BE at 2nd lot that was fast money

--- 帖子 #711 ---
GRPip, i downloaded the odl demo metatrader just to check out the differences you claim i might find to other brokers. and i look at the charts and it looks just the same, there is a sunday candle and also my AUD/CAD short signal on interbank looked just the same on ODL. can you tell me what was wrong with that signal that is winning 200 pips right now?

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Heck, man....you're right and you're in profit and you're going strong....ain't nothing wrong with that! 8^) And....those of us that took last evenings ODL signals should be at least +150 pips ahead already today. Will post a report later this evening on those trades. Hate to admit but it's about time I started getting outa my comfort zone and try something new! Let's work together....think we need your help here....how about it? I've been demoing with ODL for the past several months....started first using ODL when OzFx came out with his system last January and he said that was the best broker for his system. Then I found this sytem in June and Bull101 said ODL was best broker for this system also. Here's my problem and I imagine many other people on here has the same problem. Even if I wanted to open a live ODL account, it takes $2000 and I just can't take that much outa my home budget right now to play the forex market. So we need to find a good, dependable, broker that will take maybe $250-$500 deposit to open a micro-account....much more realistic for me. I honestly believe that IBFX fills the bill and only takes $250 to open a live micro-account. I really don't know anything about a Sunday candle or even if we should trade on Sunday candles using this system. IBFX opens their weekly session at same time as ODL....both open new daily candle at 7 p.m., Central Daylite Time, USA, I believe. Is this correct? Why not everyone interested open a $250 IBFX demo account, using .01 lot size (each lot, one cent)? Then let's start a demo test this coming weekend for a 3-4 weeks and see how it goes. Hunter....when do you start your trading week on IBFX? Do you care to post trades for IBFX and I will continue to post for ODL? What do you think about this proposal?

One valid trade tonite....U/J Long. It's a valid buy signal, but watch carefully for a while as the stoch might change from green to red during the first couple hours of trading. Price also isn't very much above 200 SMA. Good luck and be vigilant! Good trading day for this system yesterday....both trades closed out in profit! 1st position on U/J closed out quickly in first hour of trading with +50 pips profit....2nd position hit breakeven SL in third hour of trading. This morning both positions of USD/CAD hit their TP for +150 pips....total for both trades was +200 pips....not too shabby for a market in today's conditions. Notice on the charts....both ODL (top) and IBFX (bottom) have same signal. Am considering monitoring IBFX closely for a while and if as successful as ODL, no reason it shouldn't be, we may switch over. Why? Because a live micro-account can be opened with IBFX for $250....with ODL it takes #2000....both brokers open at same time, 7 p.m. CDT, USA....good reasons to switch!

yes thanks i alos monitoring ibfx

on IBFX we have 12 new pairs to study i will activate it

No valid signals tonite on either ODL or IBFX....bad timing as the U.S. Senate is poised to vote on the massive bailout package in the next few minutes. It's almost like the forex world is holding its breath! The forex Gods giveth....and they taketh away! Yesterday we were +200 pips profitfor the week....today most of us are back to even after losing 200 pips as both our U/J long positions hit SL. If you're also demoing with IBFX, depending on what price bought last evening, some of you may still be holding both positions on the U/J trade....currently -12 pips on both positions. Better luck tomorrow!

Two valid signals tonite....both shorting NZD. NZD/USD....short....my price.... .6584 NZD/JPY....short....my price .... 69.12 Both signals are on ODL....no signals at all on IBFX....good luck!

Well after a wonderful windstorm that took my power out for over a week and then a power surge when it came back on that fried my computer, I now have electric and a new computer. Been trading for about a week now and finally getting back over here to see what has been going on. GrPip, Something is up with your charts. Never in any chart that I have ever seen, has a candle had around a 1400 pip movement in one day. Both of your charts have that. Something isn't right and it will throw off your signals. I just posted the one chart, but my NZDUSD charts don't show that either. Check some of the other charts too and see if that is on any other ones

--- 帖子 #719 ---
EJ....glad to have you back....kinda wondered where you disappeared to! Anyway, checked all my other ODL charts and that 1400 pip candle is only on N/U, N/J, and N/Chf....so had something to do with the NZD last week on 9/25....don't have a clue as to what happened! Do I recall correctly that you said ODL and IBFX should have about the same signals? Anyway, last nite IBFX didn't even come close to having valid signals on the N/U and N/J. Don't know what's going on....crazy market right now!

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I've decided over the weekend that I just don't have the confidence to ever risk real money and trade this system live. Therefore I won't be posting any more signals here. If anyone else wants to continue this thread....have at it with my blessings....good luck everyone....it's been fun!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
hi sounds good. but can it work on a 15 min chart? also on the daily chart, what happens if a trader misses the the entry point? ie when the awesome has turned red and stoch histogram is red? thank you hypnos63

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Ron Hi, can you add mm feature to allow 5 orders with a BE TS onto the Trend Finder Daily EA. I want to order five lots, take them out 20-40-60-80 and let the last one run until stopped out by BE or TS Thanks for any consideration.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Ron Ray, Would you be so good as to advise as to what are the best setting in the properties of the EA. Does this EA place trades or just let you know when it is a suitable time to trade? Thanks Rob

--- 帖子 #148 ---
The last post was two years ago I was wondering if anyone is trading this system. kind regards
