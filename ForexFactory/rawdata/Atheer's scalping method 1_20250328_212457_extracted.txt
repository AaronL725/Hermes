There is no need to have any indicator to win in Forex............... Just think again for example the yen trade i posted as a scalp now making more than 30 pips and counting............. look at R/R 1/30 Forex is winning game for those who think of R/R and those who let their profit run and cut their losses short You can not control the market but you can control your trade This method have built in capability to implement 'cutting loss short and letting you ride the wave of profit'

what is your criteria for determining candles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5????

Thanks for sharing, looks great !!!

you are the great Nikki...................

hmmm. So far all I see is cherry picking the past. I would like to see some "live examples in action. Also. You say no need for indicators but all your charts show bollinger bands.?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I read it. It does not tell us how to determine the five candles. It says for example, " *** The last candle is forming the high of the last 5 candles *** The last candle is closing as bear candle *** Stop is above the high of the last candle *** Take profit is at least 10 pip" It does not tell us how to determine the last candle.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
loss is unavoidable........but keep it small this system will tell you once your stop is hit that you are trading the wrong direction.........at least for the current time i posted yen trade at the the same time of its occurrence and it was a great winner see chart 165,166 in the same chart of that trade there were buy trades but i did not take them.......why because from my experience i know that the daily trend is changing down(below is a chart i posted earlier in my thread chart talk) were I alerted traders to this change........... Even if you entered the wrong direction,if you stopped out then reassess the direction............... this thread is meant for system discussion and not my trading journal................I faced the same problem in my other thread you can demo the method and see for yourself I have many techniques to scalp profitably Scalping is my profession Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #22 ---
sell now on yen

--- 帖子 #23 ---
audusd sell setup stoped so audusd will go up for sometime and trade reversal is one of the methods to deal with stop hit

--- 帖子 #24 ---
most of the times if the setup failed and stopped out and not reached 10 pip take profit it will reach that on the reverse side or at least you can take away the loss

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #26 ---
think like this look at the current candle,and to the 4 candles to the left see if the current candle is forming the high for those 5 candles then see if the current candle will close red pull the trigger sell and the reverse for buy

--- 帖子 #27 ---
my fellow traders....................... ask any question do not be shy.............. ask why when where what which how.......... I will answer when i have the time...........

--- 帖子 #28 ---
ok, so let´s start. It is easier for me to test something more visual. So i made a little indicator to test this strategy. What I see is that your pictures shows only the entries at a potential reversal point. Because looking at my indicator (please check if it´s following your rules) I see so many arrows ... showing the losses would eat the profits. Maybe you look at BBands or something else. From what i see a filter is missing if we just use the 5 bars rule. So before going ahead with the indicator adding alerts and that stuff would be good to: first check if it´s correct. and second maybe add a filter.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
let me see

--- 帖子 #30 ---
that usdjpy sell came good for 10 pips..

--- 帖子 #31 ---
which one of them

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yes your indicator is good in spotting every setup............. yes if you take every setup you may have a problem.............. but there are tricks to avoid that............. we will come to them one by one.............

--- 帖子 #33 ---
The 1st trick:The 10s *** Avoid taking multiple trades in opposite direction............ *** Avoid taking this in less than 10s or we can say in the same 10 zone............ *** Try to take trades matching the daily direction I will post charts to illustrate this point

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #35 ---
THE 2ND TRICK:BB EXTREMES *** Take buy trades at the lower bb extreme and preferably when the price is getting out and returning sharply....... *** Take sell trades at the upper bb extreme and preferably when the price is getting out and returning sharply....... *** which way to choose depend on current and daily trend *** when bb is widened is better than squeezed

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I will test this system in DEMO using the 1min chart as setup for the 5min Binary Options. It looks good when the 5th bar is outside of the BBs !!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
OK testing is OK

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Here is a quick DEMO of using the 1min Chart for trading the 5min Binary Option:

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Lets say USDJPY is down on the daily. If we're in a sell trade already and we get another sell setup, should we also take that before the first trade closes. In the example below (in hindsight it came good) but it actually tagged the upper and lower Bollinger Band.

as you can deal with emotions.............profit limit is the sky..............

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Yes, I think so, by the way I would like to hear your opinion on the strong Resistance at 1.1324 in EU pair..

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I don't think it will be a problem just matter of time euro may be targeting Oct high or even Aug high

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Another way of increasing your odds of winning...................is type 1 candle entry in one minute chart I divide my battle field into one pip zones.............as in my charts........... Type one candle could be bull or bear................ for both the opening should be in between lines(not on them) for the bear one it should have an upper thread extending into other zones other than that of the open for the bull one it should have a lower thread extending into other zones other than that of the open combining type one candle( special type 1 candle) with BB extremes will give good entry

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Since I use horizontal lines to analyze price in all time frames I see candles in relation to these lines of three types type1,2 and 3 Now we are concerned with type 1 candles that show significant orders at certain level i.e lines for the sake of this method we have some variant of type 1 candles that gives us some edge for entry i call it the special one later on this special one as in chart 169

--- 帖子 #59 ---
The special one: Its a type one candle its body should cross more than one line its low/high is in the same zone of the close i.e low of the bear candle is in the same zone of its close and high of bull candles is in same zone of its close

Hi atheer, thanks for pointing the filters. I made some mods to the indicator. Added 2 kinds of filter. One using the bands and other the candle size (all candle (High-Low)) Please take a look so we can improve if needed.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thank you for this indicator. It makes it easy on the eyes. I like how it looks on higher time frames as well. Can you possibly add an alert function to this? Pop-up, sound and email would be great. Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
yes i will review it and till you thanks for you work

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Sure. I was going to wait to add the alert function after we finish the indicator. Dont know why....lol So here it goes the v2 version with alerts.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
man, that is one long signal bar. i take it that you buy on the open of the next candle after the signal candle, right? in the case here, that's a lot of movement to want to buy into, with the new candle way up in the BB.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks for adding the alert. However, on my platform it is repeating over and over about every second. Is it me or the indi? Thanks

--- 帖子 #76 ---
yes about 5 pip risk+spread..................one of the ways to deal with those trades is to wait for pullback near the low to decrease risk...........in this example the price was generous and gave you the chance to decrease risk...........and this was because of the importance of this level that is right if the R/R is not appealing don't put your money on the line the special one specially in euro most of the times rewarding

--- 帖子 #77 ---
No its not you. sorry, my bad !!!! I forgot something. Here it is fixed.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Sorry again. the alerts were one candle late. Now it´s ok.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
yes looks good..................though i am not fan of indicators thanks for your efforts

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Another way of increasing the odds of wining: *** the 3rd and 4th candles are closing successively on after the other i.e for bull setups the 3rd and 4th candles are 2 red candles closing one below the other and the reverse for bear setups *** extra: 5th candle is closing lower than 4th open in bear setups and reverse for bull setups

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Great! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
your work is greatly appreciated keep in mind that the filtered indicator omit a lot of good trades in between the bb extremes we will come to how to identify them

--- 帖子 #88 ---
How about closing profitable trades with a new opposite direction signal...? It would provide a good R:R by closing out losers fast and letting winners run...

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I am not a fan of this way of trading............ AS early signals in the right direction can be taken for more than 10 pip some in the experienced hand can be taken for 100s......... So I see this way as cutting your profit not cutting your loss reversal of losses is better way May be you can convince me if you have a back test of your idea In general if i took a trade i will wait for 10 pips distance to be taken or i will exit by some trailing stop usually i will wait for chosen direction until the move is fading

--- 帖子 #90 ---
The idea was based on my observation of potential trades shown on your screenshots.

If you mean that those are 2nd method trades no they are not you need lines to spot type one candles for bull candles we are spotting price coming back to lower thread of type 1 candle for bear candles we are spotting price coming back to upper thread of type one candle see last charts 179 and 178

Juan you are supposed to take sell trades based on red candles not green as in your 2nd trade 2nd trade green candle is not type 1 candle its type 3 if you suppose that its type 1 candle you have to take trades from lower thread not upper same faults apply for the 1st trade

--- 帖子 #109 ---
ok i understand thanks for your time i send you a Colombian Coffee !!!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
2nd method is simple just try to digest type1 candles

--- 帖子 #111 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Im with you... I don't get it. What is the criteria for a "Type 1" candle? As previously stated (i don't mean to be negative here), all the screen shots just show cherry picked trades from the past. If you cant show live trades then perhaps at least use an indicator to show the trades taken? like the one in my pic. At the moment from what i see is it is just a guessing game with 50/50 probability.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
So what is a "Type 1" candle? Before you say, i have read the thread and attachments. Although you talk about the candles you don't explain the criteria for them? Not trying to be negative. As stated by someone, you say the method does not use indicators but it seems heavily reliant on BB indicator.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
ok...lets see if I understood what a type 1 candle is. As he said : " opening should be in between lines(not on them)" I didnt see he shared already on #post66 the indicator with the lines. And also: " for the bull one it should have a lower thread extending into other zones other than that of the open" Wich I think it means the wick. So looking at his picture 180 on #post 106, I can see the lower wick come from another zone/line and the open is in between the lines. And a more special type 1 candle would have: " its body should cross more than one line its low/high is in the same zone of the close" Wich can be found on Picture 169 at #post 53. The candles cross 3 lines and as its a bear special type 1 candle the lower wick is in the same zone of the close.

ops. I missed that. my bad. thanks !!!!!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi All, I was interested in this method earlier today so I decided to write some code and test it on raw data from March 2016 for the EURUSD. I used the rules as outlined by Atheer1's scalping method 1 in the original post. I fooled with the settings in order to get 'optimum' stop loss / take profit levels. I couldn't get it to generate a profit for the month. These are the variables that can be tweaked in the code I put together. Number of candles to look back (default = 5) constant pair spread (default = 1 pip, best case for most on EU) stop loss gap (default 5 pips). This is the arbitrary amount above the high (when entering short trade) or below the low (when entering long trade) point of the triggering candle that Atheer1 states to set stop above or below, respectively. take profit gap (default 10 pips). This is the semi-arbitrary amount that Atheer1 has given as a potential take profit point. It would be easy to see where you 'should' call it a trade if you could see the future, but for testing purposes a value must be set. trade size (default 1 standard lot) This comes into play with my next additional variable. trade size multiplier (default 1) This is a multiple that you can optionally use which increases your trade size by its factor, only after a losing trade, like some kind of semi-martingale metric. A lot of the situations I ran into were that I would get a triggering candle to enter short, and then, before a stop loss or take profit was triggered, another candle might come in that would trigger another short trade, and then before those two trades would hit a SL or TP, a candle would come in that should trigger a long entry. I ASSUMED that if you had a current short trade that was opened based on a previous valid candle and then you ran into a candle that triggered a long trade, the short trade would close and instantaneously a long trade would be entered. This is how I set it up. So there are three ways a trade can end. 1. Running into an opposite direction triggering candle. 2. Hitting a stop loss on the way. 3. Hitting a take profit on the way. I used the first 25 full calendar days of March, 1M raw interbank data, and these are the results I got: 2,793 trades (yikes) 1,007 winning trades 1,785 losing trades Trade Size = Constant 1 Standard Lot EUR/USD Loss / Trade = $8.66 Total Loss = $24,194 Now, granted, with that number of trades the spread is going to destroy you, so I ran the same simulation with a 0.0 spread (I wish right!) and I will admit it generated a gain of $1,886 for the month, or about $0.68 profit per trade. A lot of work, and plus there is always a spread, or a commission, or something. I would like to get some input on how I should tweak the parameters, or also possibly modify the code to zero in on more specific situations, instead of trying to trade every single qualifying candle. Regards, Eric

--- 帖子 #119 ---
It's not that I'm doubting that this method can work, because I think it can and I find it interesting to try and take the method and back test it until I can get accurate profitable results. The next step I will work on will be to have another portion of code that is monitoring the instantaneous moving volatility (BB essentially) and put in some factor that can be tweaked to trim back the flat zones where money can be burned easy going back and forth.. Good work, I forgot to say earlier.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Thanks. Not sure i will trade with this method but good to find this Indi. Very helpful in ranging markets. Green pips to you all!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I just wanted to say thank you to "atheer1" for posting his idea and to "guilherme" for taking the time to code the idea into an indicator. Much appreciated , great work you two !!!. Thanks, curiousmal. atheer1: Don't mean to be a free loader, but I was just curious to know what other great scalping ideas do you use for trading ?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
You say "Don't be shy", so I asked.... Below is the first chart you shared. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But you know in real life, the chart will not be opened like a book to you but bars by bars it unfold. So I backtrack and show you want I mean... Attached Image 5th candle appears, enter "BUY" order. Few bars later ... Attached Image You got stop out if you set SL at the last swing low. Then you wait for the next available trade opportunity ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) 5th candle appears, enter "SELL" order. Few bars later ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) You got stop out again. I thought ... maybe I have misunderstood your explanation in the word doc. So I downloaded Guilherme's Atheer scalp 1M v2 Alert.ex4 indicator to check. Then I discovered there many repeated (false ??) entry signal. Perhaps Type 1 candle is the explanation to filter out false signals but I have difficulty trying to figure out what scalping method 2.doc is trying to say. Maybe someone who have comprehended can paraphrase or explain where did I understand it wrongly ?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Yes, the problem i have seen. All examples are just hindsight. Not sure how well this works real time. Would be good to see some actual trades.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Atheer looks like good system Thanks to Guilherme for indicator. Try it with renko, morning trade +10 on EU From Arrows u can see its easy to take 10 pips

--- 帖子 #125 ---
All I'm saying, is that if a method works in real time, a simple redacted live account summary of trades or a trade explorer that shows real trades would be helpful. Atheer1, can you provide? I have a trade explorer on my page, public viewable. It's a demo but mirrors what my live trades are. I will attempt to start using this method on my trades and see how I really do.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Or even charts with live trades. Anyone can draw plots on previous charts and say "Look, this was the perfect place to take a trade". So some live forward testing would be good to see. Nice trading by the way. You sure you need a new strategy?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I'm always looking to improve and add knowledge to my methods. Surprisingly, I've never worked with EA programming in MT4, one of those things on the to do list. All the testing code I set up is in Excel files, using the raw data and VBA to work with it. Does the job for back testing, pretty flexible. Easier to code than C++ or equivalent hybrid IMO.

there's no reason in the world to not show live (demo) trades. so far all i've seen are cherry picked trades, which might be good enough for early teaching purposes, but at a certain point the OP should put some mustard on the hotdog. saying, this is not a trading journal, is just a cop out.

This is my choice for a good set up. Daily &amp; Hourly are up, giving me a long bias. Lowest low of previous 5 bars. Previous 2 bars were red and closed successively lower. Open was in lower quadrant of BB. Open was not on 1pip line. Wick extended well into 3rd line above, making the open and close fulfilling a requirement listed in post #51. My biggest faux pas was to not notice news coming up in 2 minutes prior to trade. I also trailed my 6 pip stop once trade was up about 7p, and because of this lost 2p on trade. Critique is welcomed.

@diamonddbw &amp; atheer1 ... I noticed a few things, [1] Your chart has horizontal lines. I downloaded SweetSpots GOLD.mq4. Compiled and loaded it as indicator. In M1, I don't get the same horizontal lines spacing that your chart has. Is there a different indicator that you guys used ? Or if you guys are also using SweetSpots GOLD, what are the setting to use to get the same horizontal line spacing that you are getting ? [2] I also noticed that at each formation of Type 1 Candles, your chart has an arrow, either blue or red depending on Bear or Bull candlestick. Can you share the indicator that help you identify them ? [3] Can you also share the setting for your BB indicator ? Thanks!

1st day of this this a try, and learning a lot. Price action on M1 can be put to music it seems. 6 very tentative trades taken, mostly rule based, and back to BE after losing the first two. No full profit trades of the bunch, however, 3 of them could have been had I not lost my nerve. Atheer, is it safe to trade this tomorrow, NFP, after the news? Edit: Scalped one more for a couple.

Here is a tip for method 1 ,but this will have the draw back of bad R/R of 1/1...................... If you entered at any signal but choosing the right direction and you put a stop of 10 and tp of 10...............mostly you will be profitable in the right direction and you will be stopped out when direction change................ I did not post that in the method as it will change to another method.................. take care

Subscribed. atheer1, thank you for sharing your methods with such openness, patience and diligence. I look forward to testing my understanding of Method 1 on Friday, I'm sure I will have questions. Wishing you and family good health.

welcome

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I'm reading the thread you began at the end of 2015. Your attitude comes through very prominently, and is a nice change to some threads I've attempted to participate in. One recent thread had so many indicators on it, and the naming convention of the indicators added to the confusion, and the OP would get annoyed with 1/2 of all the questions. So, thanks again for being a real person, and not just another walking, talking ego machine...

jeetvirk, Would you mind sharing the renko indicator? Never used renko charts before but would like to try it! Do you use 5 bricks? Regards nikki

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hello, what is your template?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi jeetvirk, Could you explain your use of the indicators a little more please - how do you combine them? I am very interested as you have used this on DAX which is what I trade every day. Thanks and regards.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
hi your renko candle is 5 bricks or 10 bricks ?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I hope Atheer have no issues with this. b,cuz renko is not part of his system. Its 5 Pip renko brick regards

--- 帖子 #180 ---
My friend template is simple, just 5 pip renko bars and Atheers indicator with fractals

--- 帖子 #181 ---
it is 5

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Thank you! Also hope Atheer do not mind.....

--- 帖子 #183 ---
lets see today's signals on DAX by the system, i didn't took other trades b,cuz i already made 30 pips from first trade.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
EU give us only one signal today.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
if you wait for the fractal. that means you have to wait 2 candles to close after the arrow. right ?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
No idea guilherme but i think fractal and arrow looks good,

--- 帖子 #187 ---
mind sharing your fractal indicator for me to take a look ? I want to add this filter to the indicator too. by default for a up fractal to form you need 2 candles with higher lows to each side.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
My friend Its not mine i think found it on FF or from other web site so credit and thanks goes to the person who made it.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
fractals is different its late most of the times by 2 bars

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Just to explain what the others are telling you, look at your pic that I modified.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Important: please don't modify original method by indicators................ If you want try it in other threads............... Indicators are not allowed in my thread.......... I accepted guilherme indicator(thanks for him) in order to make it easy for the eyes of other traders................ Fractals are late by at least 2 bars.................. Indicators fit the price into a postulated setting which don't fit any market condition...... Indicators will make an obstacle in front trader eye to see pure price action........So keep that Renko chart away...........horizontal lines is better way of looking at price and enough if you tried it to spot S/R see the 1st post I said do not add indicators If you are indicator minded trader ,please don't put those in my thread

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I agree. Let´s not mess with this good thread. Even my indicator, I made just for visual backtest purposes. I suggest trying not to use it for trading. What he says is true. Your mind will be fooled. We have to think, analyse.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
EU M1, Friday, current PA approximately one hour after NFP. I've seen several of these situations in which a top/bottom has formed according to 'Type 1' Except, the Bull/Bear candle does not make the high/low. Am I making something from nothing, or is this a situation to consider? This low is also a higher TF Support, which I've been watching.

Good Morning Atheer1 I am @EST Zone, so here it is now 10.09am Morning. I have a quick question, I hope you would not mind. WHY you have TWO methods side by side?? Is Method2 Better than 1?? Why do you need Method2, you already have 1, just for My curiosity. Take care, loveandpeace

1st candle on the left is not type 1

--- 帖子 #200 ---
EU M1. This is a set up from approximately 15min prior to More US Red tag news. EU is quite bearish, so I was waiting for the most probable sell set up. There were three previous set ups (from 1.1367 low) that basically qualified, however I did not take them for these reasons, which are solely my view according to what I think I'm learning here. From the bottom; 1. (Arrow High @ 1.1378) This was the 1st set up after the bottom and would usually avoid due to person preference. 2. (Arrow High @ 1.1383) BB's are contracting, and even though this was approaching an area of recently formed mini support I decided to wait and see. 3. (Arrow High @ 1.1387) This one was tempting because now it was approaching s/r levels from London Open. I decided to wait for the next potential set up above, because of more Recent resistance. Since US news was so close I almost did not take the 4th set up (Arrow High @ 1.1393), but the pin bar convinced me to risk the trade, which I was prepared to leave before news, win or lose. About 7 minutes prior to news I did get out at the "Mini Support" level marked on chart. Only 3.4p profit. It would have hit 10p target. No complaints.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
have a nice weekend for you too

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Precisely. I am simply questioning to see if this particular 'Look' has any significance according to your research. Thanks

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Sweet system! This is nearly identical to how my original mentor trades. He exits at 5 pips usually, but I like that you've focused on the fact that you can use a tiny stop and let it run. Got this one and the EU pullback to broken support with a 1.8 pip stop, took 18 pip target = 10:1 Reward:Risk. Very nice -

A tip for method 2: Try to take trades based on wicks longer than 1 pip

--- 帖子 #207 ---
EU M1 0826 NY Time. Question on this screenshot of your screenshot from chart #191, Pg. 10, Post #194. I reviewed your rules from Method 2 and need clarification please. Your quote from line 2 under 'Sell Entry': *** Wait for the price to come to the area of the upper thread of that type 1 candle. In this SS the 2nd bar following the "Type 1" candle, goes into the body of the "Type 1" candle, but not into the 'Thread', which I believe is your normal term for what I know as a 'Wick'. #1 The "Method 2" entry does not have to be from 'Only' the 1st bar following the "Type 1" candle? And if so, is there any limit to the number of following bars that can qualify? #2 To qualify as "Method 2", the price does not need to reach the upper "Thread" (Wick) of the "Type 1" Candle? Sorry for all the questions, maybe I'm over thinking this. If I am, a simple "Shut Up" will suffice.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) *** for one minute chart setup its enough to look back for the current and previous hour taking into account S/R formation *** ideally price should retrace to the wick zone,but if you see the need to trade an obvious S/R reaching the open may suffice *** if you want not to be aggressive wait for the 2nd candle to close to take the trade ,but sometimes aggressive entry can give excellent R/R

@atheer1 In first post You posted a picture with entry according to basic rules. I have SS from today. There are also entries with basic rules from the first docx. Look how many SL's was on this chart. Is there a simple way to filter bad trades? Please forgive me my question but im little confused with Your methods. English is not my mother language so maybe i dont understand it corrrectly. Maybe You or someone else can write in one post step by step entering the trade. Thank You Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Surely If you take every trade you will have net loss We introduced many filters to the method It is not a complete mechanical method Some of the filters are: ***current trend *** Avoid taking trades within the same 10 zone *** BB extreme trades are more accurate trades *** 2 successive candle filter of same color(3,4) *** S/R filter *** Avoid taking trades in opposite direction while you are in a trade ( reach 10 or stop ) *** Small candles filter *** 2 method confirmation filter *** BB width filter i.e avoid taking trades while BB squeezed *** zone method filter and so on so it is not complete mechanical entry,and one you have arrow you entered I will try to make it more mechanical so that new traders can trade it successfully

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Ok, thanx. From last pic i chose couple of trades with filters: *** BB extreme trades are more accurate trades *** Avoid taking trades within the same 10 zone *** 2 successive candle filter of same color(3,4) *** Avoid taking trades in opposite direction while you are in a trade ( reach 10 or stop ) *** Small candles filter *** BB width filter i.e avoid taking trades while BB squeezed Attached Image (click to enlarge) I had 30 pip profit and 3 pip loss. Now You talking Do You see other good trades that i missed? Forgive me but in this way i can learn faster and easier.

Good morning, afternoon, evening to all. Starting out this week attempting to identify zones I should be watching for on EU H1. I'm not drilling down to the M1, as of yet, since Friday was NFP and market has yet to open on Sunday/Monday. I appreciate ALL comments.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
So from chart 198 would this previous setup also qualify as a method 3 setup? Would it be a good one or better yet... why wouldn't you choose to trade it? Do you also look for previous zones to reverse from or are they a stand alone setup? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #258 ---
So are all of these zones you marked out from chart 205 considered fresh zones? Because price has reversed from zones 2 and 3 already. Also... I think you may have mentioned this already... but once the zones are marked on the H1 chart do you watch price action from the H1 chart or do you drop down to the M1 to watch for setups? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #259 ---
yes I watch one minute to pin point my entry................yes it is an art It took me about 6 year to master this art

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Ok... and do you consider all of the 5 zones you marked out on chart 205 fresh zones to watch for price to come back to... or are the two zones that price already came back to no longer considered as a fresh zone? Hope this makes sense.

So what do you consider a broken zone? When price just comes back to the zone and reverses or does price have to go right through it? Or is it both? Sorry to keep harping on this but it looks like the most critical part of methods 1 and 2 is marking the right zones for a retrace and want to find out how you look at it. Really appreciate all the help you are giving us.

You said you don't trade asian session but if this was london/ny with more movement what would you be looking at with the zone setup? Would you be looking for a signal candle in one or the other zone via method 1,2,3... or would you be waiting to see which side breaks a zone and then wait for a pullback to the new zone made by the opposing team?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I will take small risk trades on both sides until the dust is settled............ As buyers are entering strong daily sell zone though I have a bet on one side more than other Already I have long swing position So i don't have to worry about the battle until the dust is settled If sellers can take Friday low then i will change my bias about buying euro my target is October high and it already 100 pip away so nothing to worry about

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Ok good to know on the small risk trades. Thanks. The strong daily sell zone is from Oct. 15 candle? Did you get into your swing trade from around the 2nd of March or more recent? Or maybe none of my business.

hi atheer, i just tried your 3rd method. got stopeed a lot on EU today, since i made entry EVERYTIME i found the pattern (2 candles diff color, higher/lower 2 candles before them, put sell/buy stop 1 pip above/below 2 diff color candles). after i read some posts from your other thread, i conclude that the method can't be executed wildly, but needs confirmation from higher timeframe. is it right?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
would you mind to show some of these failed trades

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I love to hear from you

--- 帖子 #292 ---
here they are, atheer. as i've said before, i took position blindly, on every pattern i recognize. well, statistically there are 7 win vs 12 loss. with RR 1:2, this would be profit on accumulative. but there was some position which hit SL+ instead of TP (i move SL to +1 after price reaching 1:1 RR). yellow label means the position hit TP, or should hit TP if SL not moved to +1. red label means the position hit SL. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) i think i shouldn't take postion on every pattern no more, should i? or.. do you have some advice on how to pick the pattern which has higher probability to hit TP.. or where to wait the pattern to show, maybe? cheers mate

You should not take any setup................... Take setups which are reaction of recent 1 minute chart zones I will try to explain later

What does this do? Only 2 settings? Thanks

--- 帖子 #297 ---
It enters the trades as per atheer1's requirements, the min and max lot size are just inputs, otherwise it will use free margin/10000 for the lot size calculation. It has a 2 ATR SL &amp; 3 ATR TP, I haven't tested the EA yet will do so during the course of the day. I can also add more variables if required.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I think I'm getting a handle on how you determine zones. It seems to me like the 2 most dominant (same color) candles are all that's used to define a zone. If this is marginally accurate, I wonder if you can tell me why zone 4 (chart 47) qualifies. Zone 3 looks questionable as well, since there was no movement in the leading direction. Thanks, Darryl

Hi Atheer, Using method 3 yesterday afternoon I had 6 trades in total across DAX, DOW and E/U, all 1mTF and in total made +40, and for the whole day yesterday, trading DAX all day, E/U all day and DOW after US Open (I am in London), it would have been about +110 in total. I place the stop 1 point/pip above/below recent high/low and TP = 10points/pips. No trade if distance to recent high/low more than 15 points/pips. SL to BE @ +9 I will see what happens today and let you know, as I plan to trade the same way all day today. Thanks.

thank you sir, that was pretty clear. so the price must created a zone before. but about zone 1, honestly i don't know how to mark that. is the explanation on another thread? bump on this link a few posts earlier http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...54#post8780054 it's just that is for D1 timeframe. so, does the concept apply for M1? if so, then i should read the whole package

wow, another method? so-- i say this method we're lookin for 4 candles, 2 couples of bull+bear or bear+bull forming peak/valley? but we shouldn't take all those patterns, we have to check where those pattern formed too, right?

guilherme is there any chance to code in one indi methods given by atheer? Maybe one indi for each method?

I will try to make it more clear later

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I made that one for visual / testing purposes. Even though we have rules....method 3 is still a discretionary method. That means we still have to look the big picture and analyse the chart. This last one (Triangle 4 candles) looks less discretionary. I just did the indicator to see how it looks like. But I wont post here unless atheer gives me permission to do so. I know he does not like indicators, and he want us all to trade without them also. Believe me... he is right.

Hello Guilherme, Feel free to share your indicators

Here is the first version of the EA that trades based on Atheer's scalping method. Use it at your own risk.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Another "4 Triangle" set up question: Which 4? Most boxes have 5 or so candles.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thanks, Math. Will test as soon as the market wakes up. Which Atheer method is this?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hello Mathtrader7: Thank you for your contribution in the thread............ I would like to ask which method of me you coded the last one or what......

--- 帖子 #361 ---
buy setup is composed of 2 red candles followed by 2 green candles

--- 帖子 #362 ---
ok. Here is the indicator for the Triangle 4 candles formation. Read the thread , take a look at his pictures and see how he does the trades. Do not take every single signal. I have added an option to show the signal during a certain period of the day (Hour_start &amp; Hour_end) in case you just want to see the signals around London open for example. To see all signal set Hour_start to 0 and Hour_end to 24. The number for of the arrow is related to the 4 candles formation. You can change the code of the arrow in the settings. Please report any problem with the indicator.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Very Nice Guilherme. Atheer you just keep coming up with more hits... I'm guessing the entry for 4Tri would be close of 4th candle?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #366 ---
yes its method 1

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Thanks Atheer. This system is simple but powerful. Just looking back at my ES trades today, the best one matches up to your 5-candle signal. I didn't know your system then, but I took that trade and it worked great!

--- 帖子 #368 ---
How about a check up doc? Here's current UJ M1. I have marked 6 zones. True or false? Zone 5 start was after small candles, that's why I chose to wait. Thanks, Darryl

Hi Atheer, Diamonddbw, can you point me in the direction of a post that instructs how to calculate the 1m 'zones' please? This is the one area I am unsure about with your methods, at the moment I am taking the method 3 trades as they come up, with no filter. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Thanks for the latest setup/method ! You are amazing with all your methods, seems to never end Regards nikki

--- 帖子 #374 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks Atheer OK, you busted me. I purposely put them off of pip markers to make them easier to select. Otherwise it's nearly impossible to grab just the trend line.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ In Atheer's other thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...54#post8780054 1st.... 2 successive candles of the same color. 2nd... close of the second is below the close of the 1st in bearish setups and vice versa. 3rd... The 2 candles are at extremes of the BB or at least beginning in the upper half of the BB in bearish setups and vice versa. 4th... we can take candles with the characteristic in 1st and 2nd as zones of reversal after breaking opposite side setups,but this is not straight forward so be careful with this. 5th... We mark the zone from the line above the open of the 1st candle to the line below the close of the second candle in bearish setups and vice versa. 6th... the zone can be traded as a reversal or breakout zone you have the choice,but for every one method there are advantages and disadvantages.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
EU H1 Current I have 3 separate potential zone areas marked. I am wondering how you interpret wicks (threads) when determining proper zone formations. Thanks

--- 帖子 #377 ---
5th... We mark the zone from the line above the open of the 1st candle to the line below the close of the second candle in bearish setups and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks G. I do understand that, I'm just highlighting the general areas in question.

Thanks atheer! Start to understand (at least I think), haha You take the candle that is "the breakout candle"+ the next one as a new zone. Even if its not close to the middle bb.....

--- 帖子 #394 ---
zone 2 is called zone of breakout which is formed by 2 candles which break r/s zone 1 also zone 3 also zone 4,5,and 6 zones of reversal

--- 帖子 #395 ---
YES

Do not panic nikki It is just my view of daily swing trade, may be I am wrong,though I took the trade I will have confirmation if yesterday low is taken

--- 帖子 #418 ---
​Hi atheer, thanks again for showing your strategies. Is it possible to explain what kind of methods do you prefer, or how do you plan your trading day? eg, first look on the daily (trend, s/r, sell -buy zones) then go down to eg 1 hour , then to the 1 minute chart? or how do you plan your trades? many thanks.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
for swing trades i have predefined daily sell and buy zones based on my zone method and when price reach those zones i try fine tune my entries on hourly by seeing signs of rejection or breakout for intraday trades i look for hourly rejection of zones in the direction of my swing trades for scalping i took what i see suitable mainly in the direction of the current daily candle or opposite at extremes

--- 帖子 #420 ---
​thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Euro seller have to close this hourly candle bearish to sustain selling

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Do you care if the 1H candle close under the sell zone also? Or, is it enough that its bearish candle close?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
rejection and close below is better sign, but sometimes the zone is wide and you have to have a better trick to decide

Ok, understand Thanks!

happy weekend for you too

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi Atheer Just started to read your threads and have a more basic question about daily direction. In the photo the bull candle has broken the last high which is also a red down candle. Would you assume the daily directional bias to be up for each of the days marked with the blue arrows. Can I assume that if the daily highs keep breaking the next days bias will be to the long side?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Although daily directional bias can help......it is right that when the price is making a new high might continue to do so but the longer it did so the higher the chance that it will turn around..................... if you mean scalping short time frames like one minute you can enter based on reaction to freshly formed zones on the same time frame or you can look for reactions at hourly or daily zones.............. read zone method to have an idea so if you see that the daily candle is green in color that does not mean that selling for scalping wrong but sometimes selling in the upper range of this day might turn the most fruitful trade but you have to know how to play it right and to take loss when you are wrong

Thank you atheer !

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi Atheer, and welcome to a new week. I have a few questions regarding your UJ H1 post #442; On arrow #1, I would have used this candle to draw the zone from. Why did you choose second candle instead? On arrows marked with #2, why are these not considered zones? Taking into account, the 3rd point from your post on 'How to mark the Zone?' (Chart Talk post #54): " 3rd... The 2 candles are at extremes of the BB or at least beginning in the upper half of the BB in bearish setups and vice versa." I can understand why you may not have begun with candle marked by Arrow #1, however your 2nd red zone begins in lower portion of BB. Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #445 ---
atheer use the candle that breaks + next one (look at post 394 and right before)! Thats why he didnt use the first candle you point to. The second zone is the same, "the breakout candle"+ next candle. Your #2 (the first 2) is no breakout, so no zone! The next two zones you pointed out is "gone" since we went right through them down again! Thats at least how I understand it! Hope its right....... Regards nikki

--- 帖子 #446 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks Nikki. I understand your comment about the zone break out. However, I do not see a "Zone" before #1 candle in my chart. The zones you call "Gone", I'm not clear on. Is it the fact that price never slowed down?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
As I see it #1 Right before the breakout down it was going sideway....... So its the breakout down of this sideway move that atheer mark as a zone! Hard to explain, sorry The second question, as I understand it.... The price continued down through the zones and never slowed down, thats why they dont count any longer I am sure atheer will explain better, haha !!!

--- 帖子 #448 ---
The last breakout zone(sell) zone still valid and now we are ranging and that is what is called zone overlap

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Those 15 minutes candles are important to watch at 10s lines ( reversal candle) indicate that sell orders are entering the market especially when combined with top of sell zone on the hourly chart I entered with them a very good intraday trade..................

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Ok....... But why not down to 1min? Now i am getting even MORE confused (nothing new, haha)

Hi Atheer, about Triangl 4 candle setup you wrote "dangerous setup" and recommended 1st filter (London open). Could you recommend another filter? Is possible to use London open filter for non Europe pairs (AUD/CAD, AUD/USD, USD/JPY)? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Another filter which is in the setup itself,after formation of the 4 candles look for the price to hit a line just below the last 2 candles in sell setups and to hit a line just above the last 2 candles in buy setup. This setup can be traded any time any pair for the pairs you mentioned look for this setup in the Asian period,I prefer usdjpy when Tokyo open

How to classify a candle as type one *** 1st we should have our lines to do so *** In one minute our horizontal lines are at one pip intervals *** look at the candle open it should be between 2 horizontal lines(not at the lines) *** look at the body is it green,so we look for the lower wick is it extending to zones(1 pip intervals) other than that of the open so OK it is a type 1 bullish candle *** look at the body is it red, so we look for the upper wick is it extending to zones(1 pip intervals) other than that of the open so OK it is a type 1 bearish candle

yes GBPUSD I use this method with majors (For scalping) as it is most accurate and have favorable spread For other pairs you have to try them to have an idea about accuracy but I know that GBPUSD is less accurate

Good Did you use any of my scalping setups

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Atheer, Would you please let me know how I can differentiate between the below two situations, the top one is not valid setup but the bottom one is very good. what is wrong in my understanding, I see the two situations are the same. Best regards

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Would you mind to encircle the candles so that I know which one you mean 5 minute chart which method you ask about You are posting a 5 m chart GBPAUD pair LT1C setups originally used for scalping 1 minute chart If you want to adopt it on 5 minute chart by putting horizontal lines every 5 pip to determine type 1 candles(although I did not test that After reviewing the chart you posted I did not found any valid setup for this method of entry Would you mind to accurately show which candles you see as setups so that I can explain to you whats wrong with the setup

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Thanx master, now i understand

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Thanks a lot for your reply, I am sorry, every thing in my post is not correct. I did not select correct symbol or TF so I will go back to study your posted charts again and comeback with my questions. Best regards

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi Atheer, I have realized that to get this to work, you have to be very quick and do all analysis sooo fast and have it in your bones..... I think I know some of the "setups" rather good but still I dont end on plus.... ( I might be to slow.....) I just want to say that you must be a great trader and you are worth all money you can get out of the market!!! Wish you lots of pips and I am sure you will get them..... Regards Nikki

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Yes - both charts LT1C

--- 帖子 #576 ---

Atheer, many of us scalpers appreciate your thread. I am hoping you would take a few minutes and look at my comments on your charts. Could you give a bit more detailed reasons for entering the trades you are posting and why you would not enter the ones I have pointed out? Again, good to see other PA scalpers helping others.

jamesr24, I dont think you understand the "type one candle", that is the first candle in the setup! Read post 562, it took me a while to understand also...... /Nikki

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hello every one, Hello Jamers24, The problem with all the setups you highlighted: either the 1st candle is not type one or the 2nd candle is not reaching the high of the 1st you have to understand what is a type 1 candle to clear the picture for you

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Have a nice week end nikki Thanks for your answer

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Have a nice weekend you to ! Glad to help! /Nikki

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi Atheer, I would like to know which broker you use? Going through your examples I can see that it seems to make a huge difference which broker you have. I dont have the same setup (LT1C, 1min) as you and the result is not the same at all on my broker..... /Nikki

Ok, thanks! /Nikki

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi Atheer, thx for sharing your setups! I made my first two trades today with it and I hope, I understood everything correctly. Can you explain how you exactly manage your trade? In this area I have a lot of problems... Is there a good way to trail the trades? Should we go for a special R:R? I hate (I think we all) to see a trade move 20 Pips in profit - and then it drops down to BE... (see below USDCAD-Trade) You wrote minimum 1:2 RR - is this the most profitable way? Thx for your patience with us! P.S.: I took this LT1C-Setups, but waited for the second candle to close... is this stupid? Or do I have a "more secure" trade for the cost of 1-2 additonal Pips, because I'm later in the trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi all, hi atheer, Thanks for this thread. Extremely clear. My comment, please correct me if i'm wrong. As far as I have read, both charts do not follow LT1C setup as the first candle is not type 1 (correct?). They are valid setups as: - 1st one is a method 3 setup - 2nd one is, ups, i was going to say method 1, but the max is not a bear candle. So I am not sure. Happy pips gonso

--- 帖子 #596 ---
It looks like you missed the first thing...... The lines! If you dont have them, how can you even look for a valid setup? How to classify a candle as type one *** 1st we should have our lines to do so *** In one minute our horizontal lines are at one pip intervals *** look at the candle open it should be between 2 horizontal lines(not at the lines) *** look at the body is it green,so we look for the lower wick is it extending to zones(1 pip intervals) other than that of the open so OK it is a type 1 bullish candle *** look at the body is it red, so we look for the upper wick is it extending to zones(1 pip intervals) other than that of the open so OK it is a type 1 bearish candle /Nikki

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Thx for your answers! How do I get the lines? I took the tpl von atheer and checked, that the open of the open candle is between two pips (= two lines). Did I miss how we draw the lines?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
You need the indicator to ! Attached File(s) SweetSpots GOLD.mq4 4 KB | 248 downloads /nikki P.s. The indicator draw the lines

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Super! Thx a lot, nikki!

--- 帖子 #600 ---
You are welcome!

--- 帖子 #601 ---
both setups are OK taking my broker into account Both candles(1st) are type 1 candles both opens are just near the line but not exactly at

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Note: I have away of trailing stop I call the intelligent TS If you want to trail move the stop below the low of type 1 bull candles formed after entry in buy setups,and move the stop above high of type 1 bear candles formed after entry in sell setups Personally I don't prefer to trail ,I exit by TP or manually

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Sorry... about type 1 candle. If the body is green with the lower wick so it is type 1 bullish... is it bullish or bearish?? I think its bearish type 1 like the example, confuse...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
in that example Sell setup...green candle with lower wick: its bear, isn't? So we looking for green candle with lower wick for type 1 bear candle to sell setup (with 2nd candle reacing the low).. so we looking for the green candle with lower wick (not upper wick) for type 1 bear candle..sorry just ask

--- 帖子 #605 ---
green=bull red= bear

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Haha ok realy confuse... in this picture 1st candle is red with upper wick then 2nd candle is reaching the high of the 1st candle with the upper wick, so its buy setup (its bull, isn't...??)

--- 帖子 #607 ---

--- 帖子 #608 ---
My bad.. I understnd now The red is type 1 bear candle but we use it for buy setup and the green=bull we use it for sell setup... Am I right? Many thanks atheer1...

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hello atheer1, Please correct me if i understand your type 1 wrongly... draw horizontal lines at X pips interval corresponding to the Time Frame... Eg. If at 5 min time frame, draw horizontal lines at 1.2000, 1.2005, 1.2010, 1.2015 etc For a type 1 bullish candle, it should open at the zone between 2 horizontal lines ( ie not on the line ) and the candle LOW extended to zones lower than the open zone. Eg. Open at 1.20035, Low at 1.1908. Question : can the lower wick end on the line...eg. 1.1905 ? For type 1 bearish candle, it should open at the zone between 2 horizontal lines (ie not on the line ) and the candle HIGH extended to zones higher than the open zone.. Eg. Open at 1.2013, High at 1.2018. Question : can the higher wick end on the line... eg. 1.2020 ? Many thanks !

--- 帖子 #610 ---
yes you are right

--- 帖子 #611 ---
yes you are right for your question about low/high of type one candle yes it can be on the line

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi Atheer, thank you for your comments on my charts! I'm happy, that the setups were correct I still have problems with managing the trades. I think I'm not so good in intelligent Trailing... I test at the moment: take half of profit at +10 Pips and let the other half of the trade run till +30 Pips. If the price goes against me and breaks the BB on the other side I close manually. Is this a good idea? Are +30 Pips TP too much? How do you calculate/determine your TP? Thx for your time!

--- 帖子 #613 ---
good plan but every setup is different depending on many factors but mainly direction of the day and time of the trade

Hi Atheer This is just to thank you for all the invaluable information you have given to us in this and the "Chart Talk" threads, and to proudly share with you and all the interested my last month results. I have been following this thread since its inception, and when you refered us to the Chart Talk thread back on April 5th post #333, to understand the "Buy/Sell Zone" concept, it made a click on me. So, on April 6th, I funded an small real account and started trading your methods, mainly: Buy/Sell Zone breakout concept - SL: 1 pip outside zone. TP: 10 pips Method 1 - mostly on middle bollinger band touch in favor of most recent zone direction. Method 3 - mostly when it is within a zone waiting for breakout, or when price is testing a previously developed zone. Now, I must be honest to accept that this post is also to remember my self a couple of things now, and for the future. Bellow are my monthly results, as you can see, I get through several phases with different emotions being involved. The results are evident. I hope I never forget this experience, I get to master your methods, and eventually trade with complete confidence, relaxed and profitable. Again, thank you very much for sharing your methods and all your support, because this could be a life changer at least to myself. masilva Attached Image (click to enlarge)

with opportunities that arise with the methods, how you behave when you are the news?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
would you mind to clarify your question?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
When there are economic news, you invest the same?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Usually before economic news,I decrease risk on all my scalping trades and usually keep some trades if i feel that the news will come in my favor

Hi, I took this nice EA setup in the morning (Germany)

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Atheer, you wrote this on another thread: "Yes there is a secret of trading,which is out of the reach of most retail traders,that is when the big money is in........ The secret is in front of your eyes in the chart......... And that is why most retail traders loose,that is a fact and it will not change for long time to come" atheer1 Can you clarify what you mean by this, or at least give a hint what you mean. Thanks my friend

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I think that is a simple one to answer--- One word-- timing -- as in clock time. Regards

Answer: Time pattern
