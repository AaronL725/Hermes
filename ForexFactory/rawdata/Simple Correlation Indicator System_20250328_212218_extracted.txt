Hey guys, Have been using this correl8 indi on XAUUSD using multiple TF with some success, but just wondering if somebody knows how to add a crossover alert to it, preferably including email and PUSH notifications. Just can't justify stare at the screen waiting for a signal to happen! Any and all help greatly appreciated! See attached screenshot for example of how powerful this can be. Notes on System as it relates to screenshot 1) correl8 indi shows USD strength rising above 0 line 2) correl8 indi shows XAU strength dipping below 0 line 3) Sell at open of new 4H candle with SL at high of previous candle 4) Exit trade when BOTH currency strength lines cross again at the 0 line. Massive move caught here. Have compared the correl8 indi with countless others and it picks up these moves nicely and before many other indicators can. Definitely worthy of somebody adding in an alert function if possible. Attachment EDIT: PLEASE READ POST 47 for an update on how this indicator is going, the logic behind it and the evolving nature of how I am utilising it now that I am having it coded by an expert programmer to include the alert function. The initial logic I was using to make trading decisions is being refined and over the coming weeks I hope to introduce a great trading system with a fully functional and comprehensive alert system. EDIT: 20 June 2016 - PLEASE READ POST 169 for a fully revised and updated strategy that I am now forward-testing. EDIT: August 28 2016 - I am getting ready to unveil my latest strategy which incorporates a completely revised Correl8 indicator. The previous strategy at post 169, whilst still valid, has some shortcomings which the latest version seems to overcome. I am.excited to be sharing my latest developments with you all so stay tuned over the coming week when I hope to post everything i have available. EDIT: October 11 2016 - Please refer to Post 365 for a fully revised and updated strategy with updated indicators / templates.

Another example on EURUSD 1Hourly TF. It is important to look at the zero line crossing when the line is steep, as in this example. The more "lazy" crosses such as the confusion leading into this large move just highlight the noise and indecision in the market prior to the move. This indicator is not going to pick up every move and there will be fakeouts which take out stop levels, so discretion is advised when placing stops etc.

An example highlighting the importance of multiple TF analysis. This works on all TFs, so a comparison using 5M and 15M, even the 1M can be beneficial when finding ideal entries.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi and thanks for the indicator. Does this work only when the market is open?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Another example of a scalp trade on the 1M chart, using the correl8 1M and 5M signals. If you are only ever looking for 10 pips a day, here is your trade. A nice separation on the 5M after the EUR is already showing weakness on the 1M just prior. As target is only 10 pips, I did not wait until the next crossover...just as well, as there is quite a bit of noise immediately following this trade. 10 pips on the 1M is a nice outcome.\\In this example I placed my stop just above a swing high...a tight stop ensuring R:R of 1:2. So you can see that scalpers can utilise this method also.

No, the indi should work at any time. I have found it a little buggy as when you first add it to the chart it only shows a certain amount of bars of data and then stops...a way around this is to scale out entirely to the smallest chart size, then double click on the indi in the Window and then just press OK, and you will see it extend indefinitely into the chart history. Then you just scale back up to where you like to usually view your chart size. Apart from that, I just think it deserves an alert function added somehow. Are you having any specific difficulty or has this answered your question?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Not to try and confuse matters, as I like to keep this as simple as possible (for myself mainly!), but if I was to add another indicator for further confluence of direction then I like to look at the Synergy suite of indis, or "Synergy Pro"...available here on the Forex Factory Forum. When combined with the correl8 5M TF, it eliminates most of the noise of the 1 minute chart for a nice 25 pip profit as shown here at the end of Friday's trading session. Confluence here between the correl8 5M TF EUR crossing the 0 line (USD was already showing weakness, hovering below 0 line prior), and the Synergy Pro yellow signal line crossing above the 50 mid-point. Profit taken again as both currencies crossed the 0 line and also at the same time as the Yellow Synergy Pro signal line crossed back under the 68 level from above. 25 pips profit with only a 5 pip SL.

Could anybody program an EA to test the strategy please?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks for your reply. I tried what you suggested. It didn't work. So I applied it on another pair and it worked. But it doesn't work for GBP, JPY and NZD. It only shows a straight line for those currencies. I'm on Tallinex. I request you to post a screen shot of your settings. Thanks

--- 帖子 #10 ---
That's odd, I have tested all majors with my broker Pepperstone and all are allowing the extra data once I follow the procedure as mentioned above...see screenshots below. I have looked through the code and can't see any option there to set minimum number of bars to a user-defined number...so perhaps this can be coded in by somebody also? Also, the settings are shown in the screenshot below, but basically keep the "Auto" set to true and all individual currencies set to "false". As far as the levels go, I delete all but the 0 line to make it easier visually as I am only interested in the 0 line being crossed by both as they diverge after the crossover. The other lines don't offer me anything useful but they are there for people to play with and suggest ideas if they see fit.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I am unsure about an EA as I trade this manually...not all setups work and I use my discretion based on several factors, i.e. the steepness of the divergence at the crossover point, multiple TF analysis, occasional confluence using other indicators that I use and then remove etc, breakouts (trendline, S and R, flags and pennants etc). I reckon there is too many variables to make an EA out of this, but a simple alert for all TF's should make it easy to identify possible setups at that moment and then you can choose to go the extra mile with your own indicators and judgement to eliminate bad trades. Additionally, I don't believe that an EA is a silver bullet to everything, and will never replace human decision making...there are some good EA's out there, but they are far outweighed by ones that blow accounts. And I don't intend on offering hope to people where there is little to none on offer. Best stick to manually trading this system IMHO.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
One of the main reasons I like this indicator so much is that is offers a clear signal based on strength as individual currencies diverge, and also indicates the momentum and volatility of a move by showing the steepness of the line as it crosses the 0 mid line. Check out this screenshot of a multiple TF trade on XAUUSD on Friday. If you are one who "Trades the Rainbow", then you will be seeking trading opportunities after the rainbow "flips", and here we have 2 opportunities based on whether you prefer a 5M signal, or wish to wait until a 15M signal for further confirmation. The 1M chart has too much noise going on, but by following the 5M and /or 15M you avoid the noise and stay in the trade for a bigger pip gain. Notice the 3rd vertical line; there has been no actual crossing of the 0 line on the 5M chart, so it is not time to exit...stick with it...even at the 4th vertical line...still no cross on the 5M. Basically, it is up to you to find what works best for your trading style. If you already have a system you employ but need something extra to indicate currency strength and volatility, try this out!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
A few more "rainbow" trades. The first one doesn't need to be examined so much, but notice the 2nd...the correl8 indi signal occurred way before the rainbow "flipped", offering an earlier signal. The exit from the first trade was a personal decision based on price action and because the currency lines had already crossed each other (XAU still hadn't crossed the 0 line) and were obviously moving sharply away from each other. Now I really need somebody who knows how to code to offer an alert for this - any takers? Preferably with email and Push notifications.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
very difficult to understand, where price to go

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I'll just wait for the markets to open. Unable to sort out the problem. The only currencies that seem to work now are AUD, EUR &amp; USD. Tried everything that I know.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Key is knowing what line represents what currency, i.e. in the XAUUSD chart, the yellow line is XAU overall strength, and the green line represents the USD overall strength. As each line diverges and crosses the 0 line in opposing directions, it offers buying or selling opportunities as it indicates one currency is strengthening as the other is weakening. These opportunities are easy to spot using this indicator. If the lines are steeply climbing / falling, the move is stronger and more volatile, and a betther trade to be taking. In order to know which direction you need to trade, you just need to know which coloured line to follow. Because the leading currency in XAUUSD is the XAU , and XAU is represented by the yellow line, you trade in the direction of the yellow line when they diverge and cross the 0 line. Each currency is represented by a different colour...you just need to look at Window 2, top left corner to know what colour represents the leading currency and trade in that direction. The actual text is the same colour as the line it represents...i.e. EURUSD shows the EUR strength as the blue line, and the "EUR" is in blue text to make it obvious. Take a close look at the following screenshots...all should become clearer hopefully.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Just to be clear, I am trading this system on it's own without additional indicators mostly, but even if you already have a system that works for you, but you just need additional information about the potential strength and direction of a move, this could be a useful addition to your arsenal.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
This can even be used to identify possible reversals. See screenshot... 1) There is a strong weakening of the JPY and it crosses below 0 line sharply, however GBP is not strengthening, just wavering below the 0 line, suggesting indecision; Both currencies cross above together and we see a flattening out of price action - more indecision; 2) A strong push up, however currencies cross each other well above 0 line and then travel down together below, then travel together up to around the 0 line where we see another cross at the 0 line itself. (We wouldn't trade a cross here as price action suggests a reversal as indicated by prior indecision). 3) From the cross well above the 0 line, to the cross AT the 0 line, we see a weakening of momentum, and then following is a strong trade signal confirming the reversal.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
OK good luck with it then...maybe open a demo with Pepperstone if you are keen to try it out and it doesn't work with your broker for whatever reason? At least that way you will get the signals and indi displayed correctly and can trade from them with your Broker. Definitely worth demo'ing IMO. I have been trading for nearly 10 years with mixed success and have made about every mistake there is to make; battled the psychology demons and so on, but this indicator and method seems so damn clear to me, I just have to share it with people in case they see it too. Best of luck tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Yes i got the same error. It wasn't showing properly on the chart. Probably it is a broker issue. But will see when market opens. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Just checking you have made sure in the settings that Auto is set to true and all other currencies are set to false? If that fails, then set Auto to false and then both the XAU and USD to true. Hope this works for now!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
My questions are for understanding, not argument. Please do not take them the wrong way. At any point in time, the price is THE PRICE, regardless of the chart time period. Mark the price at time t0, wait, then mark the price at time t1. The difference in price from t0 to t1 will be the same regardless of chart time period. Shouldn't the indicator show the same display regardless of time period? Where is the flaw in the logic? Thank you. EDIT: It appears as though the correlations would be the same regardless of chart time period IF the indicator started at the same time in its calculations. The indicator give a false impression the correlations are different for different chart periods when, in reality, it is the start time that is different.

so far as i can see in your picture, your broker is using a different suffix (XAUUSD+)and maybe this is the reason that it doesn´t work properly.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Great Idea. I was also thinking about that. But I'll wait till tomorrow. Once again, thanks for the indicator and appreciate your desire to help others.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
You're most probably correct. Do you know of way we can get around this? There is no setting for this, but maybe something can be done in the code. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
i´m not a coder but you can try to open the indy in the meta editor (by just double click the indicators mq file) and change the name of all pairs to the right suffix or you ask here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=166758

Have you tried this indicator with commodity currencies?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi there, no the coding doesn't include commodity symbols. I am sure they could be coded in but I don't have any coding skills. The currencies available are listed in the settings, i.e. AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, JPY, NZD, USD and it offers the inclusion of XAU which I really enjoy trading so I glad this is included in there.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Just did that. Doesn't work on some brokers, I suppose. No change in live market either. On Pepperstone it works perfectly.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Have just noticed a bug which I need to bring to people's attention. The currency pair that is displayed in the top left of the indicator display window seems to be showing all currencies other than the USD as the leading currency, i.e. for all those currencies where USD is the leading currency, (USDCHF, USDJPY etc) the display shows the USD ALWAYS as the secondary currency in the pair. Example: JPYUSD is displayed rather than USDJPY. This could lead to confusion for new traders to the market, especially as I have been suggesting to always trade in the direction of the leading pair. When the leading pair should be USD but the indicator display shows the USD as the secondary pair, someone might place a trade in the opposite direction of the signal if they didn't already know how currency pairs are typically shown. One way around this is to ALWAYS trade in the opposite direction of the GREEN (USD) line. As the USD line colour is always green, trade in the direction of the other coloured line to ensure you are trading in the direction the signal is indicating. If anyone knows how to correct this in the coding, please let me know. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Just picked up around 40pips on XAUUSD trading off the 1Minute chart...see screenshot. Traded the signal shown down to the Daily Open. Notice how sharply the currency lines diverge away from each other.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
It is not a bug per se. Switch to show all and it will display all of the currencies.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks for this clarification. I hadn't thought of trying this out to check...it obviously displays them in order. With respect to your earlier question, I just don't know how to respond to be honest. All I know is that the indicators display differently on each TF, and I have taken countless trades on most TF's based on nothing but the signals, and I am have ended up mostly in profit from these trades. I expect it is similar to taking trades on different TF's based on a MACD indicator or any other. The signals occur differently on each TF - I expect that is how the indicator has been coded, but not being a coder I just don't know how it actually works "under the hood". Or perhaps I am not following your original question well enough to reply correctly?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
My question is one of logic and technical. Probably out of place in your thread. My apologies to you.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Live trade in progress. 5M chart showed a decisive divergence just as a 5M candle closed after breaking through Daily Open line. SELL XAUUSD 0.1 lots, SL 1243.70 (recent high) and TP 1240.00 just above next Pivot Point (which is showing as Monthly Pivot at 1239.60). Have posted additional indicators that I used for this decision. UPDATE: Moved SL to BE.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Ahh when I say commodity currencies I mean currencies that are from countries vvery dependent on commodities for their exports. CAD AUD NZD are all commodity currencies.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks for the update...it's obvious that I don't come from a financial background, huh!? Even though I have been trading almost a decade, I rarely venture out of my comfort zone - I like to keep things simple - brain can't handle anything more complicated! But yes, I have tried it on AUDUSD with success on the longer term TF's, 4H, D1 and W1. Haven't attempted it with NZDUSD or USDCAD at all.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I have posted a job request in MQL5.com asking for an alert to be coded into the correl8 indicator...I hope to have a functional version within the coming weeks. I will test it first and then post it here for people to trial also. I have requested screen popup, sound alert, painted arrow, email and push notifications be coded. Also, I have requested that either or both the crossing of 0 line, or crossing of the lines themselves be coded, and then I can backtest various methods and combinations and report any findings here.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
XAUUSD Accumulation? If so, price may well retest the daily open line before dropping...SL moved back to where it was just above Daily Open to allow room for any spikes to happen. UPDATE: Price has broken down through that rising trendline. Hoping this works out soon now - Asian session can be so slow!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Kirklea The Correl8 indicator is superb, but difficult to understand. We would be very grateful if you explain the conceptual and mathematical processes, to examine whether it is possible to make an EA that can work without losing control in critical situations such as the accumulation XAUUSD you show, on this case the EA could generate many orders buying and selling without possibility of generating profits, creating a high risk situation. For other side, is very significative the coincidence from the curve of correlation of secondary currency or commodity (i.e. XAU) , that is very like to Demand Index curve for the same secondary currency or commodity, calculated by the James Sibbet algorithm. Because this fact, very important know the conceptual foundations. Thanks,

Hi and thanks for your question, albeit very hard for me to answer directly, but I have a few points to make in reply. The indicator is not mine, I found it using Google and have just tested it out for many months now on different pairs and TFs, both on it's own merits and alongside other indicators. I have no clue what mathematical processes are at work behind the scenes. All I know is that it gives a great signal when there is a divergence between the strength of two currencies, i.e as one currency is shown to strengthen, and the other is shown to weaken, I exploit this divergence and trade in the direction of the leading currency in the pair. All I know is that it works; time after time, however I have used it for many months and I don't trade every signal, only those which show steep lines diverging away in opposite directions and generally only in conjunction with S&amp;R lines, trendlines and the other basic fundamentals of technical analysis. If you have read the entire thread so far you will have read that I do not recommend an EA being made out of this, as EA's are essentially robotic in nature and can't react to the tiny nuances of the market that a human can. I can read price action reasonably well, and I get a "gut" feeling when a move is about to happen...this can't be replicated in an EA, so I don't believe this indicator should in any way be seen as a magic bullet that can instantly turn a profit. Rather it should be seen as just another tool in your arsenal to help identify strength and weakness in individual currencies and exploit that "divergence" as it becomes more defined, as shown by the angle of separation of the lines themselves in the indicator. The reason I started this thread was to try and attract interest from people who could code in an alert function so I don't have to stare at the screen waiting for something to happen...I have now given this job to a coder at www.mql.com and should have this ready to test by the end of the week, after which point I will share it here. But like anything in forex, Caveat Emptor! There is no Holy Grail in this crazy game...so I offer this indicator for evaluation and testing purposes only. If it fits your trading style and you can see the logic that I do when using it, then that's great. Lastly, what I have found after almost 10 years of trying almost every indicator under the sun, is that you need to spend time with an indicator, many many hours, learning to identify it's characteristics and behaviour in the market in relation to price action. This indicator is no different, which is why I am posting different examples to give people an idea of how this can be used in a wide variety of ways, and on different TF's. At the end of the day it is YOU that will determine an indicator's usefulness - an indicator is not inherently useful unless you learn to understand it intimately. Sorry I couldn't answer your question more specifically, but it is important that people understand the points I have made above and not expect any magic.

Good multiple TF trade example on the H1 with both H1 and H4 correl8 indis on the same chart. 1) On the H4 indi, notice how leading into the move, there is a slow contraction of the lines, and then the USD dips below the 0 line, indicating USD weakness. 2) Both currency lines are now showing weakness under the 0 line, and this is indicating indecision in the market - we wait for a long signal. 3) On both TF's we get a cross of the lines themselves indicating a shift is taking place 4) Trade entry at start of new candle 5) SL placed at recent swing low 6) EXIT STRATEGY - there are several. In this example I offer two alternatives; we can use either the H1 exit signal or stay in the trade until the H4 exit signal. (Or if you prefer a shorter TF why not introduce a 15M correl8 into the picture? It may create a little more noise, but it is your strategy, so try out what you reckon in line with your trading style). Results - 80 pips inside a day and a half, or 130 pips in 4 days...is it worth waiting the extra time for the extra pips? Your call, but I would probably take what is on offer earlier and look for better opportunities rather than tie up capital for a few more days. Also, if you were to use the 15M and 1H TF's instead, you would have many more trading opportunities present themselves inside of this larger move. I wouldn't have a third correl8 on the screen as it takes up too much real estate. Rather, I have 3 active charts, 1 showing 1M and 5M, another showing 15M and H1, and a 3rd showing H4 and D1. This way if I am in the mood for scalping I can, but I can also easily see what is happening in the longer TFs.

A quick update on getting the indicator coded better to show the alert function. I have decided on better logic for the coding of the alert function, based on the volatility of the divergence (steepness of the lines as they separate). This will now mean that a crossing of the lines at the zero level line is no longer as important. Rather, the amount of separation immediately after the cross is critical. Basically, the indicator will now calculate the value of the each currency line at the start of each new candle once a cross has occurred. E.g. one currency may have jumped above the 26 level line and have a value at +31, whilst the other currency may have dipped slightly and have a value of -10. The formula will add the relative distance of the two values away from each other and arrive at an answer of 41 (one currency is 31 away from 0, the other is 10 away from 0 in the other direction = 41). Please note that it is not necessary to have ANY level lines visible once this alert function has been coded in. As long as this number is greater than 24 it should provide an ideal signal. This is based on me having watched this indicator for many hours and backtesting potential signals, calculating the value of the lines at the start of each new candle after a cross, and concluding that a separation of at least 24 does indicate a tradable move. I have asked the coder to make this number a user defined field so different settings can be tested. An additional criterion is that there must have just been a cross of the lines on the next highest TF. This should help reduce noisy, false signals during sideways markets. Exit criteria - the indi will calculate the distance again between the 2 lines as they start to converge, and a combined value of less than 24 will signal it is time to close the trade. See attached screenshot. Please note that the cross of the lines no longer needs to be above or below the 0 level line, that is now irrelevant. It is better to measure the divergence itself and use that absolute value to determine a signal, rather than where the cross has occurred within the indicator display. I am really liking the logic of what is slowly evolving here...I hope others can see some worth in this also. Dare I say it? I am thinking that this actually could be coded into an EA after all, perhaps one with user defined trading session times, news filters and so on. But I'm probably getting ahead of myself!

Hello Kirklea: I appreciate your answer sincere and transparent; and I fully share their opinion about it is not possible to make an EA and the need for an alert function. I must emphasize your generosity in sharing this indicator and above all share their experience in the use of this indicator to follow the price action and market behavior. Thankyou in advance by share the new version from indicator with alert fuction.

Hello again...the indicator is evolving as I explore this whole concept in greater detail. Whilst there is nothing essentially wrong with the concept of a 0 line crossing as the visual alert (it's how I have traded this over many months now, with success), now that I am analysing this more after starting the thread, and thinking critically about how to code it logically, it has revealed more to me than I had previously noticed. Please read (or re-read) my most recent posted update regarding the coding of the alert, which offers clarity on the changes and the logic behind them. This should provide a clear explanation of how this idea is slowly evolving over time. As soon as the revised indicator is available and I have tested it for functionality, I will share it here for all to test and share your ideas. I am hoping this will be within the next 2 to 3 weeks, but testing obviously takes time. Regular updates will be provided however.

Backtesting new indicator logic on different currencies and have decided on a new combined value number of 52, NOT 24, when entering a trade and exiting. This is an important change, so please examine the following screenshot closely to understand why this change has been made. A value of 24 may be ok but it may be a noisy and not provide a strong enough signal to warrant opening a trade. Also, because we are using the next highest TF crossover signal as a pre-requisite for entering, note that we need to wait until the close of that higher TF candle before we move on to STEP 2 and check for crossovers for the chart TF in Window 2. Before I continue however, using this indicator does not remove the need for basic technical analysis, i.e. drawing your own S&amp;R lines and so on. The attached screenshot shows a great trade example on AUDUSD 4H with the confluent signal having first come from the next highest TF (D1). Notice there is a strong resistance level that has been tested a few times and failed. Notice also the contraction on the D1 corel8, indicating a possible reversal as indecision sets in. We are looking for a trading opportunity after a cross on the D1. On screenshot example, at the close of the D1 candle in Window 3 of the chart, there is a cross with a value of 141, well above the required level of 52. So we now do 2 things: a) check that there has already been a cross in the same direction as what just happened on the D1 in Window 3, or otherwise we wait for a cross to occur at the close of a candle, and; b) calculate the combined value on the current TF in Window 2, and if &gt; 52, we enter our trade. If the combined value &lt;52, we wait for the close of the next candle and calculate the value at that time, and rinse and repeat. See screenshot example - there is a cross on the H4 with a value of 71. Also note that the candle formation for that candle is a DOJI just above a previous resistance level. Another reason to support our long trade. We enter long at the open of the new candle. Stop Loss will be just below previous resistance level using whatever SL method you like to use. Now just relax and wait until an exit signal on the H4 display in Window 2. We will see the lines start to converge, and indicator will keep calculating the combined line values at the close of each candle. Once the combined value falls below 52, it will alert us to exit the trade. If you are user of Pivot Points you may choose to exit the trade manually at any point that you noticed the lines converging as price approaches a PP - just a thought. Please know that I AM aware that backtesting in this way can seem to some people like "curve-fitting" i.e. it is so easy to see the value of an indicator in retrospect. The true value is what lies in front of us and whether these signals will work into the future. I only include these examples to help in understanding the logic behind the system I am working toward. That's why I am having this coded and will be forward-testing this on ALL currency pairs that the indicator offers, and on most TF's (1M up to D1). TO SIMPLIFY: STEP 1: Wait for a crossover in Window 3 of the chart, which is the display of the next highest TF - wait until the CLOSE of the candle to confirm the cross. STEP 2: Calculate the position of the lines in Window 2, by doing the following... a) place a vertical line through the candle that has just closed in Window 2 b) hover your mouse immediately over the two lines and a little display will show giving the value of the line at that point in time c) Add these values together (ignoring the minus sign for the line below zero - we are calculating the overall separation, i.e. the distance from zero to the positive line value, and the distance from zero to the negative line value). d) If this combined value is equal to or greater than 52, we enter our trade in the direction of the line representing the leading currency in that currency pair. e) I the combined value is &lt; 52, we wait until it climbs above 52 at the close of the next candle...Rinse and repeat. STEP 3: Once in a trade, we only refer to Window 2 values, and exit at the first candle close where the combined value drops below 52. This may seem a lot to actually do manually right now, but rest assured the newly coded indicator will do everything for you and alert you at the right time.

kirkle is it correct entry? Attached Image (click to enlarge) How long do you earn on this indicator and system?

Yes that looks fine, in the sense that on the H1 chart the NZD strength is still well above the zero line and the USD strength is still well below. And you are spot on regarding the S&amp;R levels and the retracement before entering. I would possibly check what was happening on the H4 chart also as additional support for your trade, and maybe even look at the 15M chart to time the entry better. I really like multiple time frame analysis using this indicator. See the 1st screenshot showing the awesome cross on the H4 - this would have been the perfect entry place around here, but as you can see the strength on the H4 chart is still there so your entry today is in line with the longer term picture of what's happening. between these 2 currencies. On the 15minute chart however it tells a different story, and it is here that we find your entry may have been timed a little better. See the 2nd screenshot showing the 15minute on top and the H1 below. The H1 is still showing strength in line with your trade direction however the 15 minute is only just approaching a signal now. Ideally I would wait until the 15minute candle was completed to ensure I wasn't getting in too soon. Also, read my latest posts about how to spot a really strong move with good separation of the lines...this hasn't really happened in this example as yet and so the market seems to be a bit quiet just now. This is not to say you were wrong in trading the signal...your trade may well turn out well for you, there is no way of knowing unfortunately - else we'd all be filthy rich! But learning to identify the perfect entry relies more on analysing what's happening on shorter time frames, whilst always keeping in mind the underlying strength of the currency on a higher time frame. Thanks for showing interest in this system - I hope to be able to help you more.

Ideally you would have got in at the close of the 1Hour candle immediately after this sharp crossover. Having said that, use caution when pushing up toward the daily open line, as in this example, as it may just bounce right off it and continue down. The best scenario on this currency pair right now would be to wait for another clear and sharp separation signal to the upside, preferably on the 15minute TF for a better entry. You already know there is NZD strength by seeing it on the H! and the H4...even the Daily and Weekly charts are showing strength. Also I just realised you asked me another question and I didn't answer it...how long have I been earning using this system? Basically I have been trading this for a few years, but always with other indicators. I decided a few months ago to trial using it on it's own and the results have been pretty good. I like it so much that I am paying a professional to code an alert system to try and make it even better, and give me alert signals to my email and/or mobile phone so I don't have to sit at the screen and wait for trade setups to occur.

Hello again, looks like your trade worked out after all, congratulations. I just wanted to add this screenshot of the trade I would have made if I had waited around for the signal that was coming on the 15M TF. STEP 1: Check that your chart is still showing strength in the direction you are thinking of trading - good; STEP 2: Head on down to the 15M and wait for a strong cross to try and get a better entry point - good; STEP 3: At the close of this crossing candle, calculate the separation of the lines by hovering your mouse just over the lines themselves on the new candle. Add the figures together for both lines (ignore the negative value for the line below the zero line). If the combined value measures 52 or greater it is a strong signal and can be traded. STEP 4: EXIT STRATEGY - stay in the trade until you notice the lines starting to converge. At the close of each candle, recalculate the values and check whether the new combined value is falling under 52. At the close of the first candle that shows a combined value &lt; 52, exit the trade. Or you can use pivot points, S&amp;R lines, Average Daily Range, Fibonacci etc etc etc...your call...but I promise you, this strategy works just fine if you follow these guidelines. All will be automated soon enough; in the meantime get practicing with looking at the combined values of the lines at the close of a candle and determine whether it is a strong move or not so much.

Thank you very much holding the position.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
First, thank you for the indicator, method and all your posts and clarifications. Need to double check this: we calculate the separation strength (i.e. &gt; or &lt; 52) ONLY in the indicator for the current time-frame, right? The separation in the next higher TF should be visually apparent, but does not need to meet the 52 requirement. Is this correct? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
STEP 4: EXIT STRATEGY - stay in the trade until you notice the lines starting to converge. At the close of each candle, recalculate the values and check whether the new combined value is falling under 52. At the close of the first candle that shows a combined value &lt; 52, exit the trade. But on M15 or H1 ??

On the 15M, as this fives you better entry and exit...i.e. if you placed your trade using the 15M chart entry signal, use the same TF for the exit. To be honest I would close this position now and wait for a bit... The NZDUSD is close to a yearly high - check the daily chart - massive resistance here. Also, if you now calculate the combined value at the recent close on the 15M, it is only 26 or so, which is the first candle close to fall below 52. Time to exit according to the strategy rules. I could be wrong - price is price and the markets are always right, not us...but better to lock in profit than risk it at such a precarious level where resistance is strong...just my 2 cents!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yes a little risky, but again check the underlying strength on the higher TF charts, and use the smaller TF to check for an entry. AUDUSD seems very bullish right now...I might wait until either an obvious break at resistance or an obvious bounce back down. The 15M chart will show you a clear signal when it decides where it its going. It is only 15 minutes or so away from the close of the H4 candle (on MY platform anyway - I realise different brokers show differing candle formations depending on where their servers are located...something that bugs the hell out of me). Check the 15 now...I get the feeling we are losing bullish momentum. EDIT: The Daily, Weekly and Mothly charts all show a massive swing to the upside, so if there is a breakout it could be soon...if so I would be targeting 0.7670 or thereabouts. But we really need a strong break above where we are now. At this price level, with all the resistance we see, I would use a H1 chart as the minimum TF to look for a clear break signal. A 15M might be a little choppy at these levels.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi and thanks for your interest in this system. As an example, if I am using the H1 chart as my current chart (Window 2 display) and the H4 beneath it to show underlying strength, I am waiting for a cross on the H4 after a close, but the close here does not have to be a great signal above 52 or anything. In some examples I have given, i.e. immediately after a strong new release, the higher TF has exploded and the cross has been in the low 100's, which is cool. But basically we are just seeking confirmation of a shift in strength between the two currencies on the higher TF, and then searching for a clear signal &gt;52 on the smaller TF. I would be also looking at the 15M to time a better entry - I just don't like having all 3 TF on the screen as they take up too much room. Hope that clears that up for you.

Why you need to trade with all these indicators. Just trade the price action!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Basically, if I could trade naked I would. I have tried it and it just doesn't suit me. I really like a visual system that confirms both underlying strength of one currency against another and this indicator shows that in great detail, right down to volatility and momentum of a shift in strength. The trouble with this game is you need to spend many hours watching screens to learn enough about price action to be able to consistently turn a profit, and people who are new to this forum and trading in general just don't have the screen hours to know the many nuances that price action displays. That's why this forum exists - to share and help others. I have taken much from this forum since I joined and now it is time to give back. If you can trade naked, that's great - I respect it. I am certainly no expert at this, but after nearly 10 years, this is the system I have decided to stick with, and believe me it works like a charm.

Screenshot shows AUDUSD 5M chart with 15M as the higher TF display in Window 3. There has been a bearish cross on both TF's, indicating the bullish move is over for now. I won't trade against the underlying longer term bullish trend, so I am sitting aside and waiting for either a break above current resistance or a definite move down on a higher TF i.e. 15M main TF with H1 as higher TF.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
SCreenshot shows GBPUSD H1 in main chart with H4 as higher TF in Window 3. A definite bearish move happening, and with 20 minutes to go on this hourly candle, I am expecting a bearish cross on the H1 in Window 2. However there is still no cross on the higher TF H4, so this would be a mixed signal. I will wait until a bearish cross on the close of an H4 candle, and then wait for the next bearish cross after that on the close of an H1 candle. If I see a bearish cross on the close of an H1 candle, I will move to the 15M chart and time the entry from here, waiting for a combined separation value of 52 or greater to confirm a downside entry. As far as the H4 display in Window 3 goes, the underlying trend is still bullish.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Just some additional thoughts regarding multiple TF analysis using this indicator. Please remember that I am learning more about this every day I post here; this thread is evolving as I learn more about this indicator and its' potential. I want other people's input also though, so if you notice you are learning something in particular about the behaviour of this indicator in certain situations, or on certain time frames, let us all know. For now though, I am slowly coming to the conclusion that this is best used with the H1 as the main chart display, with H4 as the underlying trend in Window 3 with entries and exits coming from signals on the 15M. This may or may not suit people reading this - some traders love to scalp, and this is probably still useful to you if that's your style. If it is, I would switch to a 15M chart as the main display, with H1 as the underlying trend chart and the 5M to time your entries. Or if you are really impatient, try using the 5M as the main display with the 15M as the underlying trend strength, and using the 1M to time your entries! But don't lose sight of the bigger picture - the higher time frames will always show you clear S&amp;R lines which the smaller TF charts will not. Always plot your larger TF S&amp;R lines first! My main focus is changing now toward catching larger moves in line with the medium to longer term underlying strength of the currencies and exploiting any shift as they cross over. The key for me is patience, and if you knew me at all you would know that I am a scalper at heart, but I am becoming more patient with time and experience. But, if you like to be constantly finding opportunities, this indicator offers AUD, EUR, GBP, NZD, CAD, CHF, JPY and XAU paired against the USD...this is 8 charts that you could potentially be waiting for signals from if you prefer USD crosses...never mind the other currency cross combinations available! There is around 30 currency pairs available to you with this indicator - every day there will be something happening, surely! And with the newly coded indicator alert function that is coming you won't have to stare at a screen waiting for these opportunities to surface! Stay tuned.

Last comment before I go back to bed! Always be wary of when you are trading, i.e. times of low volatility. The Asian session can be brutal on your account when there is nothing but sideways movement, which is generally the case. In many cases you may get a perfect entry signal, but there is just not enough momentum in that trading session to warrant taking the trade. The final hours of New York as it leads into the Sydney open can be painfully slow also. Best times to trade, as everyone should already be aware, are those sessions that offer the greatest chance of higher volatility / liquidity. London (particularly the open) and especially the London / New York overlap. Give yourself a chance and don't trade this system during quiet times unless you are on a demo and just want to practice and learn how everything works.

One indicator I find useful is the "Vertical Line moves with price" indicator. It plots a vertical line right through the most recent closed candle, which may be useful when calculating the values of the lines as they expand and contract. Just hover your mouse over each of the currency strength coloured lines, slightly to the right of the vertical line, and it will display the closing value for that candle. Don't hover your mouse too far to the right into the area of the currently forming candle though; you will get the wrong values displayed! See screenshot and the little popup display window when I hover my mouse just to the right of the vertical line. It identifies the USD green line has a value of 12.

Hello Kirkleaforex, What do you think about using the !Correl8 indicator with a Daily chart only?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thank you Kirkleaforex for a great indicator and system. I've been looking back at charts and the system seems simple and profitable. Though, I have a problem. The indicator is not working on XAU/USD... Look at my screenshot below. Can you help me?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi Darryl thanks for being here. If your trading style is looking for larger moves then this indicator is great for that. In this case i would use the D1 as the main chart, and have the weekly running underneath to display the underlying trend strength. You then have several options: 1) Trade only in the same direction as what the weekly is saying, taking a trade every time there is a strong D1 cross greater than 52 and closing it when combined values drop back below 52, or; 2) Use the H4 chart to find an entry once the W1 and D1 agree, and use the H4 as your trade filter, entering and exiting trades when the H4 combined values rise or fall beyond 52, or; 3) Counter-trend trade using H4 and D1 against the weekly, ignoring the W1 underlying strength. If you were to do this however, i would want to see a strong cross on the D1, wait for a retrace and then time your entry after a strong cross on the H4 for confirmation. There's so many ways you can use this, but those would be my suggestions. Obviously on the larger time frames keep your lot size within sensible MM guidelines and use a tight stop at a recent swing high / low, but if you learn how to read this indicator well, particularly using multiple time frames, you will no doubt pick up some great pippage! Good luck and stick around.

Hi swetrader and thanks for your interest in this thread. I wish I could take credit for the indicator itself, but it was just something I found when searching Google. Kudos to the person who coded it, I say! Regarding your issue with XAUUSD not showing, I would try the following: 1) Check your indicator settings first. Sometimes when you have "ShowAuto" set to true it is a little buggy, so set this to false and then set the USD and XAU to true. 2) The XAU may not have it's full history loaded into your MT4 data history. This process is a little more involved, so I will provide a link offered by my broker Pepperstone , which explains step by step how to load historical data for a particular pair. https://pepperstone.com/en/support/m...mt4-chart-data If neither of these steps work, come back to me and I will research this further for you. Hope you get it sorted though...XAUUSD is an exciting pair to trade!

Hi Kirkleaforex, thanks for the detailed answer. It makes a lot of sense.

LOSS of 10 pips on AUDUSD. Not all trades go our way, and using this system is no exception. Price is price, and the markets are always right. No indicator in the world can give us a magic bullet to ensure every trade goes our way. See screenshot - AUDUSD broke through resistance and immediately returned to this same level and found new support. We wait for another signal and we get it...Long entry taken. But then price stalls and ends up crossing back again. Our rules are to exit the trade once the main chart TF correl8 combined values drop below 52, and none of these line values give us that until it's too late and there is a reverse crossover against our position. Checking the next highest TF above, H1, we notice weakness setting in also. Now the trade hasn't hit our SL which is below today's open and sitting at yesterday's support, but take a look at strong resistance where price is on the D1 chart, and we realise we probably should not have gone for this trade to begin with. Note to self - always check higher TF support and resistance! Lucky it was only 10 pips lost (plus spread)... Based on the price action on the D1 (possible bounce off major resistance), and what is showing immediately on the H1, I am now seeking selling opportunities for the AUDUSD. Will wait for price to break below 0.7460 (strong recent level) and then wait for signals from H4 correl8 before seeking out opportunities to catch any downward movement.

Hi Kirkleaforex, If you advise what is the basis of calcualtion then we can think of using this indicator for trading: MT5 indicator coded by PipPod says the indicator plots the correlation between eight currencies calculated from twelve symbols with one of the following indicators: Moving Average Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Stochastic Oscillator Relative Strength Index Commodity Channel Index Relative Vigour Index DeMarker Oscillator Momentum Index Triple Exponential Index Your indicator MT4 relies relies on which calculation and which one you have found reliable for profit in gold trading?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi simnz and thanks for your question, however as the indicator doesn't belong to me I have no idea as to what the basis of calculation is in the coding. I don't use MT5 and so I haven't seen the example that PipPod has written, but I do know that the MT4 version does not offer all of those user inputs that you have listed. I can see in the MT4 code itself where I believe it is doing the calculations, however I don't know how to read and understand it. Sorry I know that isn't much help to you. To be honest I am less interested in the why and how of the correl8 indi, and more interested in the fact that it just seems to work. I prefer to simplify things - I don't need to understand why it works, it just does. If you know how to read MT4 code or know someone that does, please open up the .mql file and examine it. That's about the best help I can be for now, sorry!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi again, I have since downloaded MT5 and looked at that indicator you mentioned. I have posted 2 screenshots; the first one is MT5 with PipPod's indicator you refer to, and the second is my MT4 with the coprrel8 indi that I use. I have set up the screens to look identical in every respect so it is just the indicaitor displays which appear different. It appears quite different in some respects, and I am actually liking the MT5 one a little more...notice how when there was little market movement during the greyed-in section on MT5, the effect was a tight-knit cluster of up and down movement close to the zero line, where on MT4 it certainly doesn't show this at all. On the other hand, the MT4 correl8 indicator picks up the downward move quite nicely just before this greyed-in section, whereas MT5 indi hasn't seemed to notice this much. What I am not a fan of is the rounding effect of the lines in PipPod's indicator which to me blurs the points at which some of the candles start and end in the window 2 display...not all but it could be slightly confusing. For some others they might prefer it. I think I will stick with MT4 for now, but thanks for bringing it to my attention.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi. Thanks for sharing the correlation indi and your strategy. I've always been interested in trading correlations. Although my current trading is based on a completely different strategy and high TFs, I don't mind scalping while waiting for a setup to occur. I just wanted to point out that displaying the data window as in the picture would allow to show the value for both currencies and calculate the sum at a glance, an option which I suppose you've alread asked your coder to include.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I am also not good at deciphering codes and unable to know which of the seven trend drivers mentioned by PipPod and quoted by me in my post is driving MT5 and MT4 and both of them have been coded by PipPod. That's why I wanted to know the code driving the indicator because then we can be cautious in travelling in the car and take all due care.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Well it's not every day I can say that I have learned something that absolutely blows my mind and simplifies things, thank you so much for bringing this to my attention. I have been using MT4 for almost a decade and can honestly say I have never seen this function. What other secrets are out there which will help me refine and simplify this strategy!? This is what I love about this forum - people willing to share their knowledge, coming together and helping each other. I am sure your post will be beneficial to those who read it and implement your idea. I know I am going to.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi again, yes you share my frustration at not being able to understand the code...I will ask the guy who is coding my alert function to try and tell me more about the logic involved. It may take a while to get this information back to you though, so please stay subscribed to the thread and I will update you as soon as I have more information.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
The logic is elementary. The indicator computes the location of price in its range as a percentage: Inserted Code [b]Range=MaxHigh-MinLow;[/b] [b]if(NormalizeDouble(Range,3)!=0.0)[/b] [b]{[/b] [b]PRI=100*(Price-MinLow)/Range;[/b] [b]PRI-=50;[/b] [b]}[/b] [b]else PRI=0;[/b] Then it subtracts 50 from the result. The range is displayed from +50 to -50.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi, Maybe I'm missing something but I have been watching the code of the Correl Indi and there are only USD crosses. Forex is a connect Market where a movement in one currency affects the others so if we think in the most trade (EUR,USD,CAD,CHF,JPY,AUD,NZD) we have 28 crosses that are not reflected in the indi. My question is: - With previously commenting, Is the indicator plotting "the true movement"? - If I put the indi in non USD crosses (e.g. EURGBP) it still remains correct? Regards.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thank you for explaining the logic.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
NeverEnd you are right, the FX market is one giant organism where a change in one currency will affect all others in some way. However in my mind the main tradable cross is always going to be with currencies paired with the USD. It is just so obvious when viewing the charts on all USD cross pairs that this indi works best. I have placed the correl8 indi on EURGBP and AUDCAD for instance, and it just doesn't seem to work nearly as well. This might come down to the settings I choose to use to generate a signal, i.e. the arbitrary number "52" which seems to work on USD pairs, may need to be revised for non-USD pairs. This number is one user input field I am having coded into the alert function so users can play around with different settings for different pairs, and see what works best for the pair they prefer to trade. All I can say is that this thread is continually evolving, and if I end up discovering that the correl8 indi is not a viable option for non-USD pairs, I will be honest enough to say so. UPDATE : I have been trialing a few options, namely adding in the USD into a separate window display on its' own as a potential filter, to try and recognise patterns of movement when USD strength rises above or dips below the zero line. To be honest I can see no definable patterns of price movement that would suggest the correl8 indi can be used decisively. There just doesn't seem to be the obvious changes in correlation strength that it so noticeable with the USD pairs. I have also played with the value of the iPRI period, in an effort to catch movements faster but to no avail. I am not giving up however; I believe there will be a way of using this indi on non-USD pairs successfully, I just have to find it!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Yes thanks TooSlow for helping with simnz' question earlier. I appreciate your continued input.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Is the indicator plotting "the true movement"? Yes. If I put the indi in non USD crosses (e.g. EURGBP) it still remains correct? Yes.

Thanks again for your continued input, TooSlow. My brain can't handle the complexity of the code itself but for those reading this thread that need this kind of insight, your input is very helpful. If you are able to discern some kind of logic when trying to trade non-USD pairs; some way of reading the indicator to see trading opportunities, I am all ears!

My question was asking how to trade non-US based pairs. The US pairs offer more certainty when a volatile cross occurs. The non-US pair crossing signals seem to be far less obvious. The angle of the lines are not as pronounced / steep. If there is anything you can offer with regards to how to trade these &amp;quot;quieter&amp;quot; pairs I would love to hear it.Also, how do you manage to have the line values displayed at the right hand side of the indicator display like in your image attachment? That would be handy for my system.Thanks.

Actually I think we don't have to talk about a "Correlation Indicator" but a "Strength Indicator". As far as I know, Correlation is messured by Pearson-Spearman Test. iCorrel is such an Index indicator. An index (e.g. Russel, Down Jones, etc....) is the ponderate addition of all its stocks. In this case, iCorrel messures the Strengh of the US Index (because it is created only with all USD crosses.) So we have had something like that.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) The construction of the indi must be, for every Currency Index: - USD (index) = 1/EUR USD + ( USD JPY/100) + USD CHF + 1/GBP USD + 1/AUD USD + USD CAD + 1/NZD USD - EUR (index) = EUR USD + ( EUR JPY/100) + EUR CHF + EUR GBP + EUR AUD + EUR CAD + EUR NZD - ......... ... and so on ** Notice tha when the Currency is in second place we put the inverse and with JPY crosses we have to divide by 100 Here at FF we have a very good indicator that messures the "Recent Strength" of all crosses and it uses the logic that I explain before (thanks to "hanover"). It sholuld look to that... Attached Image (click to enlarge) At every point if you add all the currencies (below and above 0) you must have (aprox.) ZERO. This is the logics behind Money Flow: when cash go into one currency is necessary that go out from other/others currencies. So finally, this is why I ask that if "iCorrel" indi does what it is supposed to do.

Hi Everyone, Kirkleaforex thank you so much for sharing this indicator. I had been using a MTF CC indicator for a long time but signals from a higher time frame were always a little late, this indicator while a little buggy (keep having to change TF up and back for it to show correctly) is just what I needed and I am looking forward to your version with alerts. In order to get alerts in the meantime I added a 12 period CCI (dotted black line and arrows) which alerts when it crosses the 0 line, it gives a lot of signals but always an alert before or on a currency line cross. I had a nice trade on GJ at the London open this morning Attached Image (click to enlarge) Green pips to you all.

Hello wifiguy and thanks for your positive comments, I am so glad you are having good results with this indicator, although to be fair I am only sharing my ideas of how this indicator can be used in a broader context; the indicator itself is freely available on mql5.com. Regarding the bugginess, please refer to POST 99 ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...43#post8972943 9) for a modified version which fixes the auto refresh issue (or just download from the attachments section up top - file is called "correl8_mod"). As an update on the coding, I have spent much of today in consultation with the guy I have on board coding everything. We have sorted out all of the logic and I should start testing early next week. Will keep you all posted with the results of that asap. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
You are quite right, it is a strength indicator...I refer to it as a correlation indicator due to its' name correl8, but I probably should start correcting that as it may be confusing some folk...but then I have to rename the thread! Aaaarrrggghhhh! In terms of whether icorrel8 indi does what it is supposed to do, the short answer is "I don't know"...I just know that it picks some great moves; I have no idea of how it is coded and nor would I understand the maths if someone tried to explain it to me...I am a simple creature! Sorry but I need to be honest! lol I refer you to a post by TooSlow http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...05#post8972105 who refers to the actual coding involved...it appears this member has some confidence in the coding and how it functions as intended. But I will leave all of that formula inspection to the smart ones among us; I just want to make some pips and then get back to making music in my studio!

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS CODE BY ANY MEANS tell people to come to XXXXXX for the latest indicator updates The author asked you to not distribute the code. Now he may not post updates because of you.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks Todd. I have compared this version to the version I initially posted and it s big improvement, and pretty much everything I have been wanting in terms of having an alert function added in, except for the painted arrow on the chart. I am aware of where this indicator has come from and am aware that the person who has modified it is protective of it being shared. So I won't be sending the modified version to the guy I have coding for me out of respect. Besides, I have some wonderful additions of my own that are quite exciting, so I am happy to keep along my own path and get this done. I look forward to sharing when everything is ready.

A quick update to those people interested in my efforts to have the correl8 indicator modified. I have spent most of Friday in discussion with the programmer, sorting out the logic and functionality, what user inputs there will be and so on. I should have a working version by mid next week to test so I will keep you updated as things progress on that front. Further to this, the programmer will be developing an EA for those who love to auto trade. I know I said that I didn't think an EA should be attempted out of this, but it seems the logic can be coded in such a way that it makes an EA possible, contrary to what I initially thought. This is quite a way off of course, but for now I will just say that it will provide a comprehensive suite of features, including but not limited to: session trading time filter, news filter, a visual matrix showing currency strength alerts for all TF's, a nicely designed and fully functional trade manager, full user input flexibility to test out different settings for different currency pairs / TF's and much more. I welcome people's input toward the development of this, through sharing their ideas and suggestions for what functions they would like to see added in. Enjoy the rest of your weekend everyone.

Hi kirkleaforex, Correlation is not Correl l ation. 1 L not 2 L. I also interest in correlation thing so i want to add that: You should let market guide you, unless you control this forex market (i believe you don't) because i see you specify number 14 in period, 14 x M5 = 1 hours 10 minutes, 14 x H1 = 14 hours, what does it mean? what 14 important? -&gt; solution: make a auto-correlation script, it help you find a period, like i did Attached Image (click to enlarge) You should choose pairs that matter most only take a look at this: http://www.bloombergindices.com/currency/ (google Bloomberg Terminal if you don't know) Watch how price react that correlation zone, not the price action itself. because when you discover price correlation, you are late there is a quote: Never trust the first price - from Agustin Silvani's book

Well this is all rather interesting! Thanks Zelo...I will look more into this...we are on a long weekend here in Australia - Public Holiday on Monday, so I will be busy doing personal stuff until late Monday here, but next week I will start looking what you have provided in earnest. Do you have that script that you can share here, or is it something you paid for and cannot share? If you are able to share more on your system for the benefit of others here, please consider. Many thanks for your contribution. I have a lot to learn from people like yourself. I am trying to keep this thread as simple as possible, but I am sure your ideas can find their way into the mix somehow!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I installed all the various versions and modification, am still not getting the indicator right. blanck screen, please help !!!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Only someone with coding knowledge can sort out this problem. I also have the same problem. Have also posted a couple of screen shots earlier but none of the suggestions worked out.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I agree with the last post...this is certainly beyond me. Some people have suggested changing the currency suffix. Do a quick search for the word "suffix" in this thread and follow the suggestions if you haven't already. Failing that, i would approach your broker support and ask them. Good luck with getting it sorted...and if you do manage to have it fixed, please share your findings here for the benefit of others here having the same problem.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Kirk, Great thread, looking forward to testing your ideas in demo and seeing how we can improve the indicator and functions. Any updates either on your trading or the indicator/ea itself? Thanks

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hey Aftermath thanks for your comments and welcome to the thread. It is pretty quiet in here and I'm not helping much as i have been quite busy myself. Hoping to have my EA prototype tomorrow for testing but it is taking my guy longer than expected.I look forward to keeping everyone updated as soon as i know more...stay tuned.I have been playing around with TDI and Synergy Pro in conjunction with the correl8 indi and it is really promising. As much as i was trying to keep my strategy as simple as possible, sometimes currency strength doesn't tell the whole story. If you already have the Synergy Pro system in your arsenal, try adding to it. You may be pleased with the results. I am lookjng at scalping using the 1M and 5M when they agree.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Kirk: I am surprised that this thread does not have more interest currently as what you have shown seems quite promising. I will give this a backtest on multiple time frames starting with the majors. I'm still wondering whether or not Non-USD crosses do not work as well as the USD ones. Anecdotally it would seem to me that this might work better on lower TF as the divergence on the lower TF 5/15/1H will allow you to capture that "spike" earlier than you would if you're waiting on the daily although the daily would be more ideal if you cannot sit in front of your computer all day long. If this works well on a daily then a lot more currency pairs can come into play, if it is most efficient on a &lt;1HR Timeframe, we do not need more than a few currency pairs to monitor. Nailing that down first will help focus where you want this to go. It's interesting you mention TDI as it is one of the core indicators that I use and I was already thinking of somehow combining it with correl before you mentioned it here. Simple Stress Free TDI System or just the original TMS thread ideas combined with this could potentially provide even better signals. Let me know if there is anything I can help with and please do not let this thread die, if you find that nobody else is interested PM me and I will gladly continue working on this with you in private if that pleases you. Thank You

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Why do you need to add the TDI? Does your previous strategy of multiple time frames not work?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I agree with Aftermath, am surprised that this thread does not have more interest. I'm using the Correl8b mod with the Daily chart and no other indicators to confuse things. I use Synergy Average Price Bars, (similar to Heiken Ashi candles), look for a move up, then a reversal with a change of candle color and the Correl8b mod indicator to make the cross over to confirm the move down. Very simple.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
That sounds really interesting. Can you show us some charts? What's your money management like i.e sl/tp and how much risked on a trade?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I'm a very simple trader, don't use a stop loss. Don't want to get stopped out. Just patiently wait for the price to move down near my target. I hope the chart I've posted helps. I'm not very good at teaching except for someone sitting next to me infront of the monitor.

Hi Ygr. As this thread is continually evolving I am always seeking ways to improve my trading and therefore need to be flexible when choosing how to best arm myself for what can be a challenging game. If trading was easy, we would all be squillionaires; but I freely admit I am not one of the lucky 5% at the top! I am constantly looking for ways to refine and increase my edge. I try not to use too many indicators as this can be counter-productive, but there are several that are my "go to" indis that I know are going to produce some results. I see the correl indi as an exceptional tool on its' own on larger time frames, however for short term I am finding it needs to be paired with something else. Currency strength on it's own tells part of the story, but doesn't eliminate the problem of whipsaws and short-term "noise". If somebody wants to use the correl8 indi as a scalping method, I suggest a multiple time frame 1M and 5M, even 5M and 15M, in combination with some of the Synergy Pro indis. I don't use the Synergy Pro Volatility indi; I use the correl8 in place of that. I find that the correl8 indi settings I use, i.e. enter trade at start of new candle once separation of the two line values &gt;=52 is a great way to spot trade entries, and especially so when used in conjunction with the Synergy Pro TDI. A simple back-test will show this. Sorry I know this was a rather "wordy" reply but I like to be thorough in my answers so everybody who reads clearly understands my method and motivation for doing things.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Here is a great example of using the correl8 indi in conjunction with Synergy startegy. Using the 15M as the longer-term TF signal, I wait for a simple cross, which happens after a touch at the S1 support Pivot Point. Now I wait for a signal on the 5M, which comes soon after. Good separation with combined values of +61 so I enter long. Target is next PP, which is the Daily. It hits this in half an hour for a profit of around 60 pips. I could have entered earlier from a previous signal on the 5M chart - there was good separation. I got in a little late. If I didn't use the Synergy TDI method here, I may have gotten in earlier and still won, but there is not as much information available to me and it could have easily gone the other way. So really, I am just following the Synergy Strategy, using the correl8 indi as my entry signal. EDIT: Added a second screenshot to show a different template example on my second screen. I have removed the TDI indicator and added the correl8 indi for the H1 instead, which clearly shows the cross on the higher TF happening around the same time as we are getting all these signals on the lower TF's. This is just more ammunition for us to confirm our long trade decision. So basically I am looking for underlying trend strength from the longer-term time frame/s, and then use my short-term TF showing the TDI and the correl8 indis for my entry. For this long entry example, I place my TP at the next Pivot above my entry, and place SL just beyond the PP or recent swing point below my entry.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Really glad to have you with us Darryl, thanks for posting your trade example and indis / template for others to try out. I am a fan of the Synergy average price bars also, they tell you a lot of information; more than just basic candles can.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thanks for your input here; I hope it is helpful to those experiencing this issue.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
It seems there is a case to consider using the Synergy volatility indicator. One thing I need to keep reminding myself as I continue striving to perfect this strategy, is that I don't need this system to catch EVERY move, but I am hoping it will catch every SUSTAINABLE move. Currently on the EU 5M chart there looks to be the start of a nice downtrend. The TDI agrees, and the 15M chart correl8 signals a sell also...do I take it? The H1 correl8 is still showing a buy signal, and on the 5M chart, the Synergy volatility indicator shows a lack of volume. Also, it is late in the day during the Asian session, so volume is going to be down. So I will stand aside until all 3 time frames agree and I see the volatility indicator start to pump. EDIT: Settings for the volatility indicator for the EU are stock standard with one exception - i.e. Level is at 0.0005.

EURUSD live trade. Got in a little late - was getting a cup of tea and missed the signal. H1 great separation, same on 15M, got in 1 candle late on the 5M. Targeting Monthly Pivot. If combined line values on the 5M drop &lt; 52 at the close of any 5M candle I will close trade early. A great example of confluence - TDI popped above the midline, volatility popped out of its' shell, and all 3 time frames showing great separation. This works folks. EDIT: Additional screenshot showing TP hit within 8 candles. A nice setup and a great result.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
XAUUSD Live Trade. USD showing weakness across the board, so taking a long on Gold. Ambitious target at next resistance line around 1303.65 but let's see how this goes. Entered trade just after the break above the Daily Pivot. H1, 15M and 5M all showing great separation, TDI indicating long signal and volatility strong. EDIT: Closed trade due to strength separation dipping down to around 28 at close of 5M candle...a nice win though...now waiting for next buy signal to see whether this move will continue. Question : Why am I closing out the trade when everything points to a continuation to the long side? Answer : There is no guarantee the trade will continue long. Lock in profit while it is there. IF there is another signal, jump on board. But greed never served anybody well, so take profit while it is available, and wait patiently for the next signal.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi kirkleaforex, This is my EURUSD 15m chart , but my correl indicator looks different from yours. Is there something wrong with my settings? Thanks in advance Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Really nice down move on XAUUSD after my initial long trade, but as I am not interested in countering the longer term time frame I am not taking advantage of this. I do have an idea for countering however, which I will share here, for the benefit of those who are into doing this. The logic is as follows: - Long-term time frame combined values start to narrow, and if, AT ANYTIME during the candle formation , the lines converge so that the combined value falls below a variable i.e. "10", then start to examine the medium and short term time frames for the signals to enter a counter. LInes that display convergence suggest that there is a shift in strength, so why wait until a cross is confirmed? By waiting until the longer term TF is closed, you may have missed out on the trade opportunity that already presented on the 15M and 5M. This functionality is being built into the EA, and the variable "10" will be a user input field so different values can be tested. Like I said it's an idea...it may or may not be viable, but on face value it seems worth testing at least. I will try to post a screenshot example to illustrate.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi there...if you mean the many "level lines" that dot their way across the indicator window, then yes, you can delete some or all of these in the settings area, in particular, the "Levels" tab. See screenshot. I have deleted all but the "0" level. Has this answered your question? Or do you mean the individual line values painted just to the right hand side of the lines? If you are after the line values, then download the "correl8_TRO_MODIFIED" indicator version and try that one.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Screenshot example of trading when longer term TF strength is close to "0" (equal), before an actual cross. I interpret this as a sign that there is indecision in the market, which may or may not mean a change in direction, so I am okay with taking a trade on the next available signal/s that occur on the 15M and 5M charts, regardless of direction. See screenshot example showing the EU, the H1 as the longer term TF, the 15M as the medium term and the 5M as the short term entry signal TF. If we were to wait until the end of the hour for the longer term TF to cross and give a signal, we would have missed the signals 10 minutes earlier that could have given us a quick 20 pips over two 5 minute candles. In addition to the 15M and 5M signals, we see the TDI offer up a sell signal, and the volatility spikes up, so let's take advantage of the signal rather than wait for a cross that may or may not even happen at the end of the hour. The example is only a quick scalp, so not the best example to give, but it illustrates the point that if there are pips on the table, it's worth examining ways of collecting them. Take advantage of indecision and take the next train to pipsville!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
You got it, kirkleaforex. This is basically the combination I have to trade pairs. You have several systems in one: - See the picture in different timeframes (the famous triple Screen of Alexander Elder). Entry in the short timeframe ONLY in the direction of the long timeframe. - A good and simple entry system ( I think TDI has very good signals) - A method to define the strengh for every currency (in this case I have seen that iCorrel seems to be a good indi). You can filter entries and do not enter in false due to a pullback. With all that if you apply a good money management and know to manage bad entries, you have a Good System. NOTE: A Good System is not a Holly Grail (Holly Grail doesn't exist). Is it possible to win in the long run also doing bad entries (by management) but we need to accept to lose in same trades. There's no system with no losses. Losses are part of the game. We only need to win more than we lose or that wins are bigger than the losses. Simple

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Thanks kirkleaforex for your reply,I mean my indicator shows something different from your indicator. compare it with your EURUSD 15m chart. I changed the broker and the problem fixed , although the charts were the same. I don't know how the broker can affect the indicator to show something differrent !

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I know, how peculiar! And you have checked the settings to ensure they are identical in both instances? We can't expect people to go around changing brokers every time an indicator doesn't work as expected...I am confused...I will look into it a bit more.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Is there anyone reading this thread than can highlight possible reasons why some people have a different indicator readout when using a different broker? I have tested this on 3 brokers that I have demo accounts with, and although I can see minor differences in the price action, the indicator display is not that different from each other. I am aware that different brokers have different data feeds based on their own arrangements with different liquidity providers and so on, and also brokers GMT server times will be different which does throw off certain time frame displays, i.e. H4 and D1 charts' candle formations may appear different between brokers, but the example provided here by kasrafx is just staggering! How is anyone supposed to trust what's happening on the screen when they are getting entirely different information thrown at them? Any help offered to clarify and / or rectify this issue will be greatly appreciated! kasrafx - if you are able to at least continue testing this out on the broker platform that does show the same signals that I am showing, then please continue along with us. FYI I am using Pepperstone as my preferred broker, and highly recommend their services to anyone interested in a true ECN broker that has high liquidity, lightning fast execution, low slippage, great spreads and awesome customer service.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Maybe I'm wrong but I've too noticed differences between brokers, although it was with another indicator. I narrowed the problem to the quantity of ticks received. This is I guess different from broker to broker and can affect the indicator's "decision". The solution was to base the indicator on the OnTimer event, while OnCalculate just provides its parameters. Not sure it works the same for you. My indicator is a kind of iBulls() &amp; iBears(). But as the correlation indicator calculates from prices of several currencies, they may be not received at the same time (I mean at the same tick) for all brokers. So the OnTimer would be more appropriate. Or at least checking for NewBar and calculating only on new bar. I looked at the code from the first post, is the actual version still not checking NewBar()?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hello kirkleaforex, I just discovered your thread a few days ago via Darryl, to whom I'm indebted for his contributions to this thread and the High Flying Trading thread. Thanks for your work here. I'm hoping the correl8 indicator will help me refine my current strategy on the Daily and 30m charts, where currently I'm not interested unless I see a candle that closes beyond the PAC and is the 3rd tap on a 3-tap trendline, or there is distinctive reversal PA. After years of not "getting" the TDI in the way others have with crosses, I now only use it to see if price has moved beyond the 50 line, where the majority of a trend occurs (a 34ema on the main chart approximates to this), for divergence and hidden divergence, and using likica's (to whom I'm also indebted and her "TMS for m30 charts" thread) rule of NOT taking buys if the green is below the 32 and NOT taking sells if the green is above the 68. Regards, Kanderpro

--- 帖子 #161 ---
please what volatility indicator do you use?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi justomania...it is the Synergy Pro volatility indicator. I do not have the right to share it here, but you will find it with a quick search for the Synergy Pro system. Good luck with it; it really helps me to identify when a potential signal has enough power behind it to get into the trade.

Just a quick update to advise that my coder has not finished the job as yet so I am still not able to start testing. I will advise as soon as I have a working prototype. In the meantime, and in line with how "fluid" this thread and my strategy needs to be, I need to advise that I have again refined the rules for the strategy and the indicators used. As much as I found the TDI useful, I was finding my charts looking too "busy", and I felt the need to further simplify things. And that's when I discovered the QQE, or Quantitative Qualitative Estimation indicator. This indicator is roughly based off the RSI, however the algorithm used is different and offers a smoothing factor. It is well known for rarely offering up false signals, and has practically no lag. I have back-tested this against the Correl8 and found it very handy when identifying entries and exits, and so I have incorporated the QQE into my strategy. Another great point to make is that the QQE indicator that I am using has a built-in alert system which offers everything I wanted for the Correl8, i.e. painted arrows, screen pop up, sound, email and push notifications. I am forward-testing both the short and longer term strategies on AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD and NZDUSD this week, and will post results over the weekend. Please note that this latest change will be my last for a while. I am happy enough with the results I am seeing now to warrant staying with it. I will post a .pdf file fully detailing the full system and it's rules soon. But for now, please refer to the screen shot examples as a visual guide for what I am now doing. These next three screenshots are for the short term trading strategy. The fourth is for the longer term strategy which utilises the H4 Correl8 and the H1 QQE, but the rules are slightly different. 1st screenshot - shows a QQE 15M signal on the EURUSD. Need to then wait for confluence from the H1 Correl8; 2nd screenshot shows the H1 Correl8 cross signal occurring shortly after the QQE. Need to wait now for entry signal from 5M chart. 3rd screenshot shows the 5M chart showing the QQE and Correl8 signals. Entry and exit and re-entry examples are based on signals from EITHER the QQE and / or the Correl8, i.e. QQE cross back over signal line is a definite exit, however a Correl8 combined line value of 20 or less will also generate an exit signal. 4th screenshot shows a longer term trade example for the NZDUSD, and uses the H4 Correl8 along with the H1 QQE indicators. All trading decisions are based off the one chart. A correl8 H4 cross determines underlying strength and trade direction, then all entries, exits and re-entries are generated by the H1 QQE signal.

Kirkleaforex great thread and technique, plus you make it fun the way you share all this. I've got all my charts (12) set up to watch the 15 and 30 minute charts with the current and higher time frame correl8b mod indies on each chart. Then I have a 3 sma shifted 3 periods to compare to the current time frame correl indi and a 6 sma 6 shifted to compare to the higher time frame. I'm just starting with this and will post some trades this week to show how I hope to make trades. Just got 24 pips going long eurusd at 1.1321 and got out at 1.1345 which was an untouched daily pivot from June 10th. I was just looking for the 15 minute correl8b to be trending as the euro line was above the dollar line and the same was in the 30 minute correl8b and then price pivoted under the white moving average and my stop was under that low. Live trade but chart doesn't show the trade cuz the indi doesn't work on that platform. Attached Image

Attachment Introducing the Strength Separation Strategy. After way too many screen hours and far too much analysis I have finally finalised my strategy. It is still reliant on the Correl8 indicator, which I have come to really like and understand. It has a great companion in the QQE, and between the two, and in using multiple time frame analysis, this for now seems a robust system which is capable of producing great results. Please download and read the attached .pdf file. All additional indicators that I use that are not already posted in this thread are attached. EDIT: Have found several errors in the .pdf file - some changes have been made to clarify ideas and correct these errors. Please download the latest version update if you have already downloaded the previous version containing these errors. I have provided a screenshot of the settings I use for the QQE indicator. These are the settings I find are working for me currently on the forward-tested pairs. Please note this is for testing purposes only, and should not be used on a live account until such time as it has been shown to be working as intended. I will provide any and all forward-testing results at the end of each week. This week I am concentrating on the AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD and NZDUSD. Next week I will work on USDCAD, USDCHF and USDJPY. From there I will start on other pairs that comprise the list of 28. Based on forward-testing results, I will ask my programmer to code this fully revised system into the EA he is currently working on.

Wow, impressive looking swing trading system! Look forward to seeing your results Kirkleaforex.

Poocher welcome to the thread and congratulations on your win. I am happy you are finding success with this. I also enjoy reading about how people are trying this system out in their own way. Everyone is different and we all see the market in different ways. What works for me is not guaranteed to work for anyone else as we all read market information differently, but hopefully the system itself and the signals it provides will assist toward developing an edge for those who need one. You will now realise that I have just posted an updated strategy with a full .pdf file explaining the strategy rules and much more. If you would like to test it out, please feel free to join me in a forward-test and post any results you get here. I am excited to be sharing such a promising system and I am looking for people to join with me in the testing process.

Early indications from trading some of the majors during the Asian session are: this is working. Too early to tell I know, but it feels good so I thought I would post my first ever trading statement after 5 winners in a row and a 6th in profit. Keep in mind this is being tested on a AUD$1000 demo, which is the amount I will be depositing when I decide to go live with this strategy. I am using a 5% risk per trade as I am feeling more confident than usual about the signals. Ordinarily I would not recommend any more than 2-3 % risk per trade. I won't keep posting these statements each day, but I just wanted to share with you an early picture of how promising this has been over the first few hours of live forward-testing.

Trade Manager account opened for the SSS Forward Test . As both the Administrator of this thread and the forward-tester of the overall strategy, I feel it imperative to remain honest, open and transparent, not just to myself, but to anybody reading this, so that realistic expectations are formed and actual results are recorded. Furthermore, any recorded data can be more easily broken down and analysed in order to refine the strategy in terms of wins and losses during different trading sessions, which currency/ies perform better using this strategy and so on. Feel free to check out the link: HERE EDIT: 1st loss after 6 consecutive wins...was going to happen, especially as I took a bad signal on the NZDUSD. The QQE indicator is very similar to the RSI, and I entered a BUY after a cross of the signal line well above 0, well into overbought territory. Very silly thing to do...I should have known better...a mistake to learn from!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
All signals are at odds with each other...see screenshot of the H1 Correl8 compared to the 15M QQE The Correl8 is still in a buy across the board where the 15M QQE is signalling to sell. The EURUSD chart is the only one to suggest any possible action upcoming; we can clearly see a convergence of the value lines, with the combined separation value currently sitting at around 30 or below. Like Mark Douglas is quoted as saying: "All I know is that something is going to happen." So it is time to stand aside until we see some confluence between all TF's. We can speculate all we like but until we get a clear directional signal with some momentum behind it, I will stay away for now and wait until MT4 starts to ping my phone with trade signals.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
LONG TERM live SELL trade on AUDUSD. In line with the basic rules of the Longer Term strategy, i.e. Correl8 H4 chart needs a combined value of &lt;=20 and then we take our signal from the H1 QQE. See screenshot - and this is what we have. This is my first trade example for the Long Term entry, so this is a great forward-testing opportunity. SL is about 26 pips away, just beyond recent high at 0.74712. There is no TP target; we just wait for a reverse cross on the H1 QQE and exit then. And take whatever comes

kirkleaforex thanks for the great system and also for posting your promising early results. can i ask what timeframe those trades were taken on? also do you think this is tradeable on d1 charts? thanks

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi there and thanks for your interest in this thread! I have attached 3 templates: 1) the long term which shows the H4 Correl8 with the H1 QQE 2) the medium term which shows the H1 Correl8 and the 15M QQE 3) the short term template, which shows the 5M Correl8 and the 5M QQE. Please download all available indicators posted in this thread to ensure you get everything you need to display the charts correctly. I hope you have success!

Hi blamshakk and thanks for your interest here. Results haven't been so promising as of last night; I blame myself for not sleeping for over 24 hours and just not seeing things clearly. Took a signal before the close of a candle and it went pear-shaped...just goes to show, if you don't follow the rules, you get burned! It will be different when I have the alerts coded into the Correl8 indicator; that way I can come to the screen IF and WHEN there is a set-up signal sent to my phone. I hope this isn't too much longer! Anyway, I am certain that this is tradeable on a D1. I would combine the D1 Correl8 with the D1 QQE...see screenshot. The white diamonds are the signal for the crossover of the signal line (wait for the close of the candle!) and indicate possible entry and exit points. In the settings you can make visible the alerts for a zero line cross also, but I find this makes the charts look too busy, so I colour them the same colour as the screen background so they don't show...the alerts still come through, just not the arrows. I have not tried out this system on the D1, so cannot recommend settings for the Correl8 separation values, but I have no doubt they would be the same as any other TF. Personally, I would set up the alert for the QQE from the Daily, then switch to the H4 charts and time your entries and exits from the next available signal from there. Means you can tighten up your SL, and the potential for a large move against you during a fundamental announcement is reduced considerably. But if you a long term swing trader, no doubt these things aren't of much concern... Best of good fortune to you!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
After very little sleep for the past several days I realise I am unable to continue with the forward-test for now...will take a break and return in a day or so. If there are any interested people wanting to assist with the forward-testing please step up and let yourself be known! I simply can't test this on all trading sessions; being from Australia I find it hard to catch the larger moves made during the New York session. Any and all help appreciated! I will answer any questions throughout the day as I see one.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I think we don't need to overcomplicate this with more and more indicators. I can use it for pure price action trading, for example counter trendline break. Just for confirmation of breakout.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thank you for the template. i thought the short term was supposed to use 15M Correl8 and the 5M QQE?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Definitely. I have been known for overcomplicating things in the past, and even with this strategy some people will find it still a bit busy...you are right of course; pure price action backed up by the Correl8 indicator picking up changes in strength in the pairs is a great method. I still have much to learn, so in the meantime I need additional confirmation. I am finding that confirmation in the QQE currently. I hope one day to be able to trade completely naked (figuratively speaking, of course...)

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi there...according to my strategy for the short term, the initial set-up comes from the H1 Correl8 with the 15M QQE, but it is a combination of the 5M Correl8 and the 5M QQE that gives the alert to enter the trade. If you feel there has been an error in the .pdf or if anything has not been made clear, please let me know where and I will attend to it.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Nice quotes. I am reading Mark Douglas at the moment and trying to get my psychology more in check...these quotes are useful and have come at a good time. It is ironic that the more I try to make things appear clear to myself in terms of signals and alerts, the more things can become clouded. I just hope the system I have devised hasn't been a total waste in this regard, and is still considered useful to those who are still experimenting.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
​I have to say that this is shaping up as one of the most interesting looking methods in a while. I have long been a fan of correlation methods and to find one which has such simplicity about it is refreshing. What I find especially interesting, as someone who generally trades the higher time-frames, is that it seems to be that rare beast - a method which gives clean-and-clear re -entry points on long-form trades which many traders miss out on as they panic at the thought of losing their hard-earned profits and bail too early and then cannot get back in or get back in at completely the wrong time. I look forward to following your progress and thanks for your efforts!

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Uncertainty is the only thing that is certain in the market. What started as simple entry method, line crossing 0 level or one currency line crossing another, has grown into a monster. What caused this to happen? Did the original fail method to produce profits? Did a rough patch cause you doubt? Did you trade too many pairs? There are many more questions but those should suffice.

We all have to learn... I think this system has a great potential! The QQE: wouldnt it be better to filter the signals? If the cross of the histo with the line is &gt;=0 its a valid sell signal, and vice versa. If the cross for sell is &lt;0 the momentum often disappears. Histo crossing zero only valid (for re-entry) if the other line is on the other side. Is there an indicator with alerts for only this conditions? Thanks for sharing, kirkleaforex !

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hello TooSlow...yes these are all valid questions for someone who is comfortable with trading price action and leaving the charts as bare as possible. And as much as I see the value in trading this way, I am not there yet. I feel that the Correl8 only tells part of the story; i.e. a simple cross of the lines is not enough information. There are many instances where the Correl8 will show a reverse cross of the lines but only temporarily. Before long it crosses back again and the trend continues. I need something that indicates the move is still going so I don't exit too early. The QQE seems a good way of filtering out this interim crossing back and forth; the smoothing ability it offers seems to pick entries and exits which really compliment the Correl8 overall direction and strength. So, in short: - the Correl8 gives offers me direction from the cross and also the volatility of the move through showing the angle of the line separation; - the QQE gives me overbought / oversold, further confirmation of entry and exit and helps me stay in a trade, and; - multiple time frame analysis offers me both the longer term underlying trend information and the shorter term alerts for entries and exits. As long as I follow this information and keep my psychology in check, I am very satisfied with the potential of this strategy. Having said all of that, your screenshots and trade examples are a wonderful example of how simple this can get if a more experienced trader has the skill. For most of us on this thread however, we are not there yet.

Thanks lemercenaire for joining us here and for your comments. They are appreciated.

Hello illiquid and welcome to the thread. Yes there are probably ways of using the QQE as a filter...for now I am happy with how the strategy seems to be offering up opportunities but to be honest more work could be done for sure. I see the strategy as a living thing; the indicators offer a user many variables to test out and if you discover something in the settings that seems to work better for you, then I am all for it. The QQE is basically a glorified RSI with added histogram functionality and a smoothing factor, therefore a simple cross of the 0 line is normally considered the trade signal. I find that a cross of the 0 line at the same time or very close to a cross on the Correl8 offers a "sweet spot" trade opportunity, however I also see potential in taking a cross of the QQE signal line when it is in oversold / overbought territory, (again, this needs to occur in combination with the Correl8). As you say, taking a BUY on a cross above 0 or taking a SELL on a cross below 0 is taking more of a risk as the momentum may have disappeared. But this is where multiple time frame analysis can assist...spotting weakness in a lower time frame can help identify signs of exhaustion. In terms of the alert/s for certain conditions, the QQE already provided here offers user settings allowing a zero line cross AND / OR a signal line cross to be visible. By now you will have found this thread to be one of an evolving nature, and so I see any efforts made by readers to help clarify these types of things as very welcome.

Hi kirkleaforex, i really need to learn this system because of the result you are turning out so far.Please comment on the chat below.Want to know if i did the right thing.Though there is a support just ahead Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi mate, yeah you missed the actual entry prior around the time of the NY open...I think the time would have been 15:00hrs on your platform (it is on mine but I know these times can differ depending on where the broker has their servers located). The QQE cross down through the 0 line from above would have been a great time to sell (at the candle close), as this coincided with what looks to be a great cross on the Correl8 H1 and also you saw the H4 correl8 separation getting quite narrow. It all depends on what the H1 Correl8 line separation values were at the close of the candle at the time the QQE finished crossing down through the 0 line. Remember also that you can look at the separation values on the H4 when you see them narrowing, and if they are getting very close, say "20" or less apart (an arbitrary number, but you get the point - the narrowing suggests indecision), then you don't need to wait for the H4 to close, you can trade off the next available H1 signal. Keep in mind that all of these suggested values, i.e. &gt;="52", &lt;="20" etc, are just arbitrary, and are for testing purposes only. If you decide in your own mind that a value of "45" signals enough volatility to warrant a trade entry, then you should feel free to make that call. But PLEASE test this on demo, not live. It is a promising system but I make no guarantees of it working! In the Correl8 settings, I use "CLOSE_CLOSE" as the "RangeMode". Try that out and you will see the Correl8 display a little differently, not enough to confuse the signals, but I just prefer the output...see what you prefer. The settings are there to test out. Thanks for your interest in the thread and I hope you find success with the system! P.S. And as far as "the results I am getting so far" goes, yesterday was a shocker! No sleep combined with constant distractions and errands that needed doing made it near impossible to do any decent analysis and I really went into a slump. Should know better than to trade when my eyes are hanging out of my head. I am really hanging out for the guy I have coding to finish with the EA so I can just test different settings and not have to trade manually as often.

Kirkleaforex Really interesting thread... subscribed. How are you doing with this system? Still on demo? Correlation strategy have a great potential. The important is knowing how to use it.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) The results have nothing to do with experience or skill per se. The results have everything to do with discipline. Either the trade is entered or it is not entered. There is no skill involved. Do you have the discipline to enter when the signal is present without hesitation or second guessing? Do you have the discipline to set your stops immediately? Do you have the discipline to move your stops when appropriate? What happens after you enter has nothing to do with your skill. The market determines what happens next. A poster talked about filtering in one of my threads today. There more you filter the more chances get filtered out. Until there are no entry signals at all. Adding more indicators does not effect what happens after you enter. Nor does looking at more time frames. Best to pick one pair, one timeframe and stick with them. This method appears to work very well using M15 charts. All you need is the discipline.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi Merka thanks for being here. Although i have been using the Correl8 on its own for a while, I have been trading this new strategy for 2 days, i.e. the combination of Correl8 and QQE. Great results when i am alert and focused, terrible results when i am badly in need of sleep and distracted. It all comes down to discipline, as in TooSlow's post just now. The signals work well in themselves but i need to stand back and wait for the signals to come to me and not jump in when i just get a feeling something will happen before it does. Having this thread is a steep learning curve for me. I am getting lots of interest and positivity from some people, which is great, and then a few people ask really pertinent questions which cut to the core of everything and give me pause for thought. After nearly 10 years of doing this i feel i am still working my way out of the 'novice' stage toward 'intermediate', but through sharing these ideas and being open to constructive comments I hope to improve my trading and help others in the process.If you could kindly PM me the details of the trader you refer to i will make contact and see how they do things. Can't hurt! Thanks.

A brilliant session trading the Brexit sentiment. Have opened a free $50 account with Trade360 , just to trial a scalping idea based on a combination of Corrle8 and QQE indicators, and it has seen my account jump from the free $50 to over $250. I realise was lucky to have a great downward trend with momentum based on Brexit speculation, but regardless of the negative sentiment today this method should work, and hopefully for those who like trading higher TF's too. FIRSTLY , I have changed the settings for the QQE and the Correl8 indicators as follows: - QQE Smoothing Period - 5 - QQE RSI Value - 89 - Correl8 iPRI Value - 89 . NEXT - I have drawn horizontal lines inside the Correl8 indicator window, at levels +/- 8 (white dotted) , +/- 21 (thin DodgerBlue or Red ) , and +/- 55 (thicker DodgerBlue or RED ). These colours / levels are for easy visual reference regarding where price is in relation to the zero line etc. (These are all FIB numbers, I know...I love these numbers, but again these are purely arbitrary). ENTRY SET-UP : I am using a 1M QQE as a potential entry signal in conjunction with a confluent signal from the 5M QQE , and then trading the breakout of the Correl8 +/- 8 zone after a period of indecision . A period of indecision can be seen as any prolonged period where the Correl8 value lines are wavering in between the +8 and -8 horizontal lines . This means EITHER 1 or BOTH value lines are inside this field . The initial signal alert comes from the 1M QQE . See screenshot, where there was a SELL signal from the QQE during the period of sideways movement. Now we just wait for a similar signal from the 5M QQE , and a Correl8 breakout of the +/-8 indecision zone. ENTER ON BREAKOUT - A breakout is considered ONLY when BOTH value lines separate and break above / below the +8 and -8 lines respectively. In this example there was a breakout of the EUR to the downside at the same time there was a USD breakout to the upside. EXIT - There are several methods one could use here: 1) use the 1M QQ E coloured diamonds to exit, and re-enter if the value lines are still outside the +8/-8 field, 2) use the 5M QQE , which will assist in determining whether or not to stay in the trade. Exit when the 5M QQE shows a reverse crossover at the close of a candle. 3) if at any stage the 1M Correl8 value lines (either or both) return inside the +/-8 indecision zone, exit here immediately. Alternatively, use Pivot Points as targets etc. I have attached the template for this which should automatically load the settings I am using, including the drawn horizontal lines across the Correl8 showing the colours and different thicknesses, and the coloured diamonds for the QQE alerts. I have the data window open at the far left to show the values at any time I need to view them at a glance. Patience is key here - due to the fact we are using a 1M / 5M entry, we really need to wait for the candle to fully close AFTER a QQE diamond is painted to the chart, and we must wait until the breakout candle period from the Correl8 indicator has fully closed also before entering the trade. During periods of higher volatility, this scalping method could really boost your account. As always however, please test on demo . That's all for now - let me know what you reckon. And Happy Brexit Day EDIT: Forgot to add, but it is fairly standard, that it is better to take the QQE signals when they are already in overbought / oversold territory, (i.e. above / below the +10 / -10 values), or at least only take a SELL when QQE is above the zero line, and a BUY only when the QQE is below the zero line. You really don't want to enter a trade after a move has been exhausted...

--- 帖子 #209 ---
For proof of the results achieved on my FREE $50 Trade360 account using the method described above, please see screenshot.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Potential trade example using this above method on the 5M and 15M. See screenshot - 15M QQE (red diamond) is the entry set-up signal. We also see divergence on the 15M QQE, which further signals a move down may be approaching. Now wait for next 5M QQE signal to confirm the entry. As the Correl8 line values are already separated outside of the indecision zone (+/-8), there is no need to wait any longer - enter SELL. Exit and re-enter off the 5M using the coloured diamonds, OR use the 15M QQE to stay in the trade until there is an exit signal there. Your choice! Even exit using the 15M blue diamond, and due to the fact that the 5M Correl8 is still showing wide separation, wait around for a chance to re-enter after another red diamond on the 15M QQE. At any time the Correl8 values (1 or both) re-enter the +/-8 indecision zone, exit immediately. A great method when there's volatility in the market. Try it out on demo!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Potential longer-term trade example chosen at random during a period where there was no Brexit sentiment - CADJPY 31MAY 2016 . This has the potential to work on the longer term TF's also, (AND on non-USD pairs!) Here I am using the H4 QQE as the entry set-up, and the H1 QQE and Correl8 as the trade entry signal. - Wait for H4 Diamond to remain visible after close of a candle; - Wait until next H1 Diamond visible after close of H1 candle, and enter trade if Correl8 lines are outside the indecision zone (+/-8) - Choose your method of exit... In this trade example, it was better to exit at the close of the candle just after the Correl8 USD value line re-entered the indecision zone. There were more pips available after this, but 50 pips in 5 hrs with under 10 pips of drawdown is nothing to laugh at. There's always another trade opportunity. Now I AM AWARE that it is easy to go back in time and find perfect trade scenarios in order to back up a theory for a strategy, and the real test lies in the ability for this to work live. So I invite anybody interested in this method to try it out and see what works. I will be trialing this on my DEMO and will post any live trade examples and results with screenshots.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
A great way to trade this above method without staring at the screen all day waiting for signals is to turn OFF any 5M signal (sound / pop-up etc) and just use the 15M QQE alert as the signal so you can then come and check out what might be happening. See screenshot 1 for an example of the settings I am using on the 15M QQE. I am having a screen pop-up, a sound, an email AND a push notification ("Notify") all set to true. Once the 15M alert is issued, you can then simply toggle ON the alerts for your 5M QQE, go back to what you were busy doing before, and wait for the 5M alert. Because this system relies on the 15M alert to signal prior to the 5M (or H4 prior to the H1 and so on), this will potentially save you many hours of screen time! N.B. Always have "Alerts on Current" set to "FALSE" to ensure an alert is not being issued midway through a candle's formation. We need to wait for candle close. EDIT: And the best way to toggle these alerts ON and OFF is to use .set files, i.e. a saved file within the settings dialogue which instantly enables / disables previously stored settings. Forex Factory doesn't allow .set files to be attached for download, but if you want a copy of mine, PM me and I will send you mine to try out. But they are easy to set up; 1) Open up your QQE settings dialogue; 2) Change the value in "alertsON" to "true"; 3) Press the "Save" button at lower right on the dialogue box; 4) Choose a name, i.e. Alert ON" and press "Save" again. Repeat the process for the Alert OFF .set file by changing the dialogue "alertsON" value to "false" and saving this as "Alert OFF". Then it is as easy as opening up the settings dialogue and pressing "LOAD" and choosing the .set file for your required alert setting. See screenshot 3 as an example in setting up an alert OFF .set file. Hope this helps!

Thanks Kirkleaforex, this is interesting and will help improve my own strategy. I also like to watch 5/15/1h/4h charts and i agree that we should not over-complicate things. On the other hand, trading "price action" is a discrete / hard to replicate way and requires a lot of experience and mental endurance. I'm looking for time frame signal confluence (the same signal on 5/15min, supported with 1/4H PA), trading QQE/iCorrel cross, supported by MA (34EMA for 5M and 21EMA for 15+). Easy to spot. Everyone who scalps / trades daily swings should use pivots and S/R. It's hard to test anything on a day like today but i will keep an eye on this thread and slowly evolve my own strategy using also these tools.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi mades and welcome to the thread. It's great to have you on board and great that you are able to utilise what you see here in your own way. That's what this is all about - sharing our understanding, knowledge and experience, and developing our own individual ideas further through bouncing them off of one another. We must be similar in many respects - you obviously like Fib numbers also, i.e. 21 and 34 EMAs on your chart etc. I don't use Fibonacci levels in my technical analysis but I have always been fascinated by the numbers themselves and the power and mystery that they exhibit. Thus my inclusion of them here as the level lines in the QQE indicator window. I will throw a few EMA's on my chart and see how they fit...not to further complicate things but just to more easily spot trend continuation and reversal etc. Good luck with your trading and please do stick around for more great stuff to come!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Kirk, thank you for the method, posts, indicators. Questions: 1. Do you use the same settings for QQE indicator for all timeframes (i.e. 5, 89,4)? 2. The pdf method description and trading rules: are they still relevant or you have revised your trading rules (as reflected in your new more recent posts) - I am asking because it is more convenient to have them in one place rather than to go through numerous posts for bits and pieces of the method. Thank you very much again, I am sure a lot of traders find your posts/method helpful and encouraging.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi MidnightRun and thanks for sticking around. Firstly let me start by offering an apology to anyone who reads my posts and feels I am "moving the goalposts" with my constant changes and refinements. If people find this confusing I understand, however I will make it clear, like I have several times already, that these are merely ideas that I offer up for people to test out and incorporate into their own strategy. The " SSS" .pdf file strategy is still a great strategy and can be used by those who see value in it. In line with my constant desire to refine and improve things through experimentation, I started playing with the settings in the QQE. I initially changed the RSI value to 21, then 34, then 55 and finally 89 (I really like to use Fib numbers!), until I saw something that really stood out to me. The 89 setting really showed the continuation of a trend and didn't offer too much lag at these higher settings when the trend appeared to change, and so I feel I have discovered a method of trading which may be even more fruitful than the SSS. And so I offer this latest "lightbulb moment" of mine NOT as a further change to the SSS , but as something separate which has elements of that strategy but is perhaps a little bit simpler in its approach. Additionally, the QQE in this latest idea offers up a clearer alert system which really saves me a lot of screen time, especially with toggling the .set files ON and OFF for the lower TF once the higher TF signal has been issued. So, in line with how this thread is always evolving, I need to point out that as much as I like the " SSS " strategy, I will more than likely be utilising the newer strategy in my own trading going forward. In answer to your second question: yes the settings for the QQE are identical regardless of the TF that I use. I would be interested in what others are thinking about the newer ideas that I posted yesterday in comparison to the SSS system. Please feel free to comment on what you like, what you don't, what elements you have taken from it and used in your own system and so on.

Following is a screenshot example showing the importance of why ALL signals need to be showing from both TF's before taking a trade. Regardless of the fact that it was very late in the NY session on the last day of the trading week, and regardless of the fact that there was little volatility left after such massive moves earlier after the Brexit announcement, this is just an example of why we should wait for everything to line up correctly. 15M Red Diamond alerts us to a possible future SELL on the 5M - BUT the 15M Red Diamond is already below the zero line...so straight away we know not to take it. If we choose to ignore this and look for a 5M minute entry signal anyway, we get one and it, too, is below the zero line. Additionally, the separation in the Correl8 happens well below the midpoint and the value lines have not exited out either side of the +/-8 indecision zone. I only post this as a bad example as sometimes traders will be too eager to get into the market and take any signal that is offered up. We need to remain patient and vigilant and only take set-ups that truly offer the potential to have successful outcomes. In the week ahead I will be posting my live trades with screenshots as they happen, not as a signal service, but as a way of showing how this works in real-time. Easy steps to remember (using 15M and 5M as the two time- frames): 1) 15M QQE alert occurs, check its' validity in terms of where it happened within the +/-10 indicator window; 2) Toggle ON the 5M QQE alert (Load the Alert ON .set file); 3) Wait for 5M QQE alert and check the validity of this in terms of where it happened within the +/-10 indicator window; 4) Check the 5M Correl8 indicator...are the value lines separating outside of the +/-8 indecision zone? Enter trade and choose a method of Exit i.e. 1) Correl8 values, either one OR both, re-enter the +/-8 indecision zone (MUST EXIT here regardless!) 2) If Correl8 values are still outside of the +/-8 indecision zone, choose: a) exit and re-enter using the 5M QQE every time another Diamond appears OR; b) stay in the trade using the 15M QQE Diamond alert as your exit. Of course you should set your SL and target levels according to your preferred method (recent swing points, Pivot Points, S&amp;R, psychological levels etc) as these levels will affect price and the likelihood of your trade continuing in the same direction etc. Lastly: you can try this method using 5M and 1M, 15M and 5M, H1 and 15M, 4H and 1H, D1 and H4, whatever you like. The principal remains the same. It should also work on any currency pair, as long as there is enough volatility for a decent Correl8 separation.

Hi kirkleaforex. Quite some potential here... For those who want to backtest, since MTF charts are involved, I can suggest a couple of indicators to either scroll forward two or more charts contemporarily or to check out past events occurring at the same time. The first one is downloadable for free here and the second one is attached (I think I downloaded it on FF some time ago). Use should be quite intuitive.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hammertop your contribution here is greatly appreciated! You are right - the SyncCursor indicator usage is very intuitive and makes for instant recognition of signals that occur close to each other. I recommend anyone reading this to try this out. I am yet to test out the other link you mentioned as I think this will suffice for now. After looking through a few pairs on different TF's, I think I need to revise my logic, i.e. it appears that after a signal happens on the longer of the two TF's, it may be a little late to enter. Perhaps we could consider waiting until the later of the two TF's, and then IF confluent conditions are already in place on the shorter TF, trade entry conditions are met? Screenshot example: TF's are M15 and M5. We see a valid M15 blue diamond BUY signal confirmed at 1845hrs, and so according to existing logic, we wait until the next valid blue diamond appears on the M5...but by the time that happens we have missed the move. Instead, if we see the M15 blue diamond confirmed as above, then immediately check the M5 for all confluent conditions, we would see an existing blue diamond was in effect 50 minutes earlier at 17:55hrs. We then check the Correl8 value lines are above / below +/-8 (dotted white lines), and we enter immediately, earning ourselves around 55 pips up to the next pivot. By using the SyncCursor indicator posted earlier by Hammertop (thanks once again!), and having the Data Window open to the left, you can easily compare the different values that we need to measure before we decide a trade entry is viable. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Just a quick word on the SyncCursor indicator posted earlier by Hammertop. By hovering your mouse over a region in time that is shared across two (or more) separate time frames, the crosshair (vertical and horizontal lines) will be coloured grey (as in the screenshot in the previous post). If you click your mouse into the longer TF chart, and then move the mouse cursor outside the shorter-term chart's currently displayed range, the crosshair lines will change colour, alerting you to the fact that you are left or right of where you should be, and you then need to scroll the shorter TF chart left or right so the charts are again displaying a similar time region of data. If you are too far left, the crosshairs change to a RED horizontal line. Too far right, they change to a GREEN horizontal line. Try this indicator out - it is simply brilliant for comparing data for a particular time region over two or more TF's.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I'm glad you like them, but I would advise to try the Syncscroll from the link as well. That one always shows both windows as active and in sync at the moment one chart is being looked at. I actually load both indicators on the same chart, as there is no conflict, and have double advantage.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Kirkleaforex, Am back after the cataclysmic Brexit ..... (That's a story for another day). Sorry this is a bit late...... I am too busy on working days ...i am always free on weekends. From my tests.....What i have noticed is that when there is a cross on both iCorrel8 &amp; QQE ... then the trade as more chance of succeeding. I don't trade on low time frames.... the least i like to do is H1 ..... so my test was on H1 and H4 ..but it worked well on H1 only. I shall post a pic later. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yep, you are right. The Syncscroll works like a charm...just group the charts you need into one group number in the settings dialogue, and wham...they scroll neatly together. OMFG. Thank you so much...makes life so much easier when testing these ideas.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks so much Hammertop. Really remarkable indicator. A must for multi time frame trading.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi, Like i said earlier....... The Way I See It. 1) The main decider is iCorrel8 ( That is ...i use it as the main Trend) 2) When there is a Cross UP on iCorrel8 3) I then look on QQ if there is .... a) a Cross UP b) both lines Above the Zero line. 4) For Close of the trade a) I use Trailing Stop b) When there is a counter cross on any of the two ( i.e QQE or iCorrel8) which ever comes first. See Pic. I do hope it is clear enough .... rushing out of the house at the moment. Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi babasemi and thanks for getting to work on the testing with me. That's great what you have found...I will investigate your findings a bit more and continue refining my logic. Obviously nothing is foolproof in this game, but if we work together like this I believe wholeheartedly we can come up with something fairly robust and perhaps even something flexible, i.e. different versions of the same strategy that work for certain market conditions. To everyone reading this: there is still a way to go before I get this exactly the way I see it in my head. I have big plans for this strategy but it will take time. Nothing worth having in this life comes without some effort! I am here for the long haul and am committed to developing this into something everyone can use, no matter what trading style, currency or TF you like. But I really need your input! If you are able to help me test this, or even if you have ideas of your own which you believe will go some way toward improving this, even slightly, I want to hear them! There is incredible value in the sharing of knowledge and ideas. So let's collaborate!

Great separation on EURUSD H1 and M15...have bought into this move to see how far it takes me. Have set TP at the Daily PP which is a far way away at this stage so will monitor price action and look for any signs of exhaustion once the morning gap has been filled. EDIT: Closed trade due to getting close to closing the weekend gap. A decent return for one day - taking a break.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Getting ready to jump in on GBPUSD now that it has hit all time low again. Either it will break down or it will retrace and maybe enter a rally - either way I am ready. Awaiting confluence of signals from M15 / M5 / M1 for a scalp. EDIT: Too tired - heading to bed...up 29% for the day so best not to be greedy and give everything back to the market. Good luck everyone...there are plenty of pips here.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Can you post screenshots of your trades, K? Also, here is an idea: Originally you were using a difference of about 50 or so between the lines. So a move in one bar to the next from 45/0 to 45/-5 is the same signal strength as a move in one bar from 20/0 to 30/-20 because at the end of the day in both cases the two lines are 50 apart. What would happen if you asked your programmer to add a third line that showed the magnitude of the change. In the second case the magnitude of the change is 30 while on the first case the change is only 5 so maybe the second case is a better signal?

So when do you enter the trade?

Congratulations mate! That's a big day out...well done and keep it up.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Kubiasty, depending on whether you are just uising the Correl8, or the QQE as well, you always enter at the start of a new candle AFTER a signal has formed on the previous one. I.e. If you are trading an H4 chart on its' own, you wait for the H4 candle to finish forming, and if there is a signal at the candle close, enter straight away. The "signal" I refer to is the separation value between the two individual coloured lines in the Correl8 indicator. If the distance between them is 52 or greater, it is an ideal time to buy (although the number "52" is arbitrary). Another example would be if you are using the H1 as the loger-term underlying trend to give you direction, and then you use the M15 to time your entry...you wait until a M5 candle has finished forming, and if the Correl8 values are = or &gt; 52, you enter at new candle open etc. Try it out on a demo - it works well due to the fact that the number "52" indicates high volatility, which means good strength behind the move and greater chance of a successful trade.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Live trade EURUSD with screenshot. H1 showing great separation already, as was the M15 but I haven't been home all day so missed the earlier move. Timed an entry of the M5 after a QQE "buy" Diamond appeared. Valid entry as QQE signal happened below the -10 line Targeting the next PP above. EDIT: Totally need to renew my prescription! The QQE was not below -10...totally stuffed this one up guys. I guess this is why I test out on a demo...I see stuff on the screen incorrectly at times. 2ND EDIT: -I closed off the trade with a small loss, then the market turned around and my trade would have been a winner. Luck of the draw...should have stayed the course...even my "bad" signal was a good signal after all!

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi again ygr, I was not at my computer when I took those trades yesterday...I got a signal to my phone and entered remotely. Going back and finding when these trades were and then organising screenshots and everything is a bit beyond me right now as I am too busy prepping my house to sell before I move overseas. Regarding your suggestion, I think it is a great idea, and covers an area of logic that had totally escaped me! I like the "magnitude" idea...so perhaps the logic would be to calculate the change in separation between the closing values of the previous closed candle and the separation values of the newly closed candle? Is that kind of what you are thinking or do have a different suggestion for the formula? I will speak to my programmer guy and see what he can come up with.

Ok distance 52 but on which time frame ? On Correlli indicator H4 M5 H1 m15 ?? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Yes, K. That sounds about right. Current difference minus last bar closing difference. Any clue as to when your suite will be released?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hello, I have seen that for this strategy there are several ways to approach it: With Correlb + QQE, Correlb + Correlb, hoping that each line crossing Correlb 0 in the opposite direction, the distance between the two lines is equal to or greater than 52, ... The truth is that there are several ways to approach it and have a few doubts. which is not the right strategy. I see you've used several different strategies or variations of the principal. When you use each ?? What SL use ??? I see that in some cases you used when the distance is less than 52 Correlb, and others use a line Correlb crossing the line "0". In other cases the crossing is used in the opposite direction of QQE. I'm a little confused with so many variants. What works for you you ??? Thanks for everything. a greeting

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Distance 52 is a measure of volatility on each TF regardless, so ideally you are looking for 52 or more on each TF to ensure there is a decent amount of strength behind the move on each TF.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
No clue as yet ygr...I have been skyping daily but currently he is not available to speak to. I will keep tryimg. Otherwise i may need to find someone else and start over. Quite frustrating for me at the moment! I paid for a service to be done within a certain time frame and we are well past that now. Will keep you all posted though.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi Sergio thanks for your interest in the thread. You are right there are many ways to employ the Correl8 indicator. It works fine on its own, it marries in well with the QQE. It works well on a single TF or with multiple. The overall principle of a 0 line cross and separation value of 52 ir more remains constant for the TF you are entering the trade from. All other factors are food for thought and for testing. The thread here is purely for trying out ideas and seeing what works for peopke. If you like the SSS strategy then stick to it. If you prefer sticking to a single TF then try that out. But only you can decide how this will work for you. I am slowly but surely working toward a system which should work for everyone but these things take time and a lot of testing. I need to be open to new ideas from people like yourself so please decide which ideas you wish to trial and help me test them if you have the time. EDIT : Forgot to answer your question re: Stop Loss. I generally look at placing SL a little beyond the recent swing point on the trade entry TF...or use the closest pivot point etc. But everybody has their own SL procedure so i don't want to assert that one way is better than another. What I will say though is that because an entry after a "52" separation on the Correl8, SL can be made tighter as the volatility more likely suggests a continuation of the move rather than a retracement. Hope this helps you.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
There's a great opportunity developing on EURUSD. Post-Brexit recovery for currencies involving GBP and EUR has seen a great example of a bear pennant forming on the H4 chart. Typically, price will break out to the downside after such a move is complete. See screenshot - pennant on H4, backed up by a slowly trending upward price channel on the H1, and nothing but meandering indecision on the M15. Seeking entry on a breakout to the downside off the M15 with volatility. H4 and H1 Correl8 indi's are already peaking with post-Brexit bearish sentiment, although there may well be a quick upward move prior to the down trend starting. Opening a pending Sell Stop order at 1.0995, just below the current S1 Pivot Point. Target at Weekly S1 1.0873; SL a tad above Daily Pivot. If trade is entered I will monitor as price approaches all time low from a few days ago and close if it looks to bounce.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I noticed this indicator repaints after some hours too... anyone noticed that?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
If you mean the QQE then yes i have noticed that too, on smaller TFs. But as you need to wait until the close of a candle before you take a signal, and because i only use it to back up signals i already have from the Correl8, it's somethinng that doesn't concern me.The Correl8 is the main source of info for my trade decision, the QQE is a great indicator for confluence and for showing trend continuation when the Correl8 is showing signs of a move ending. But each to their own. Just use the Correl8 if you don't like the other. It's great on its own merits!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Keeping a close watch on GBPUSD, hovering around Daily R1 level and now a quick spike above...Is this accumulation before the next big sell-off? Or is the start of a new rally in search of the next major resistance level? Waiting on the end of this H4 candle and if we see a sustained break above where we are now, I will buy into EURUSD upward move, but if we see a return of the GBPUSD below Daily R1, I am looking to sell EURUSD. Waiting on confluent signals on H4, H1 and M15 Correl8 indi with high volatility before entering either way.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
small update in my trading I'm finding QQE to be the best indicator (sofar). Experimenting now with 10 SF for 5min (89ema) and standard 5 SF for 15m+ (89ema) as i noticed the qqe signal crosses quite often during smaller pullbacks. QQE alone can give 50+ pips easily on more volatile pairs (GU) on daily basis. Combined with another famous non-lagging indicator (BollingerB), you can predict when the price is about to stall for some time only to continue in its direction (or change course). Multitimeframe analysis is necessary. Correl is nice but produces a lot of fake cross signals compared to qqe so i prefer qqe for entries supported by higher TF correl. The QQE indi posted here is quite resource-hungry (cpuwise). I'll try to look for another one.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hello , I'm trying to Correlb strategy in 2TF different + QQE histo EMA, H4 and TP 50 pips, most operations winners. I added a volatility indicator (BBBT), now I do not have much time. When you can hang some historical operation. By the way kirkleaforex, you've been very good profitability, Could you add screenshots of your operations history ??? I think it's more important to know when to leave, that the entry point. A greeting.

Dear TooSlow I wonder if youcan share your indicator from the picture you posted-15 CORREL8B-. If it is a personal indicator and you can not share it, I will understand. Anyway , thank you very much for your time All the best Dan

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Morning, If you do not want, for whatever reason, to share the indicator - it's understood, it may be proprietary, ect. Could you at least reveal one aspect of it - the iPRIP value? (There are readily available iCorel indicators out there). I understand from your comments that the trade trigger for you is the currency line crossing above/below the zero line, so what I have in mind is a) compare the available iCorels' performance with the screenshots you posted a few days ago, and b) watch the performance of the available iCorels in real time based on the value (20?) that you'll hopefully reveal. Thank you.

Hi. While we're waiting for K's developer (ehhem ) I thought to ask for the magnitude idea on https://www.kreslik.com/forums/theru...odified-t11849 because they did the modified indicator from a a few posts back but I am having trouble creating an account. Can someone post the following there for me? "Here is an idea: A move in one bar to the next from 45/0 to 45/-5 is the same signal strength as a move in one bar from 20/0 to 30/-20 because at the end of the day in both cases the two lines are 50 apart. What would happen if you programmed a third line that showed the magnitude of the change (with alerts please)? In the second case the magnitude of the change is 30 while on the first case the change is only 5 so maybe the second case is a better signal?"

Hello thread...been a while! Yes, thanks ygr, you are right - I have just sold my house and am in the process of preparing to move overseas with my wife for a change of life. I had no idea how busy this would make us both...so many things I had not anticipated, so I have put trading aside for the moment until I feel I have the time to focus. Regarding my developer, this has ended in disappointment I am afraid...he has pulled out of the agreement claiming he no longer has the time to devote to the coding. I have gone through arbitration and have received my refund. I now have requested a top developer attend to this matter, and am waiting to hear whether they will accept my proposal. I have set a project time of 1 to 3 days, so I expect to hear something next week and will post an update here as I know more. I appreciate everybody's patience while I "take care of business" here at home...I hope everyone is having success using the Correl8 indi and is testing out different settings. I still see a great benefit in exploiting a strong crossover and separation and will be pursuing this idea in time, but for now I need to attend to personal matters. I am moving overseas to Thailand on September 5th. I will still be on here when I find some spare time, but certainly not as often as before.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thanks for the update K. Enjoy Thailand! Will you ask the developer to include the magnitude idea with alerts for it also?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
hi is there new version of this indicator

--- 帖子 #267 ---
ygr - just sent PM - please check and reply. Thanks. And yes, I have asked the programmer to cover your idea extensively. I think you will be happy with what I have organised on this matter.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi Ramingold...I have only tonight engaged the services of a new programmer who promises to have a working version of a modified version of Correl8 within the coming days. I will spend a little bit of time testing it out and if it does what I expect it will, I will post it here for you all to test out. The new version will have complete alert functionality, as well as being able to compare the current closed candle values with the values of the previous candle's values, in line with a suggestion from Ygr on here recently. This should filter out weaker signals. There will also be an exit alert which can be toggled on and off in the dialogue box. The exit strategy is not as well-defined as the entry, so it will be an option available for testing, otherwise it can be left OFF and you can use your own exit strategy. Lastly, there will be a matrix-style multiple TF display detailing current / previous closed candle values and whether a BUY / SELL / WAIT signal is current for each TF from M1 to D1. This will assist with easy visual reference to see whether a signal on your chosen TF is in line with other TF's, thereby potentially offering more weight to an alert. Assuming all of this goes well, I plan to have my programmer help me with coloured candlesticks, i.e. depending on the strength of the separation, each candle could be coloured differently. Similarly to Heiken Ashi, Stoch candles, or the Average Price Bars of the Synergy Pro strategy and so on, a candle with separation values in a certain range would be coloured differently, making for an easy visual reference to see volatility increase and decrease as the currency lines expand and contract. To explain this in more detail, since it is always the prefix of a currency pair that we buy or sell against the suffix, if the prefix of the currency pair (i.e. EUR) crossed over the suffix (i.e. USD) and above the zero line, the candles could range from white (weak values) through yellow, lime, green to a dark green (high volatility values), or if the prefix crossed below the zero line, the candles could change from white, yellow, orange, red to crimson. This is all just a theory at the moment but I believe this has real potential in a similar way that makes Heiken Ashi candles so useful in determining possible reversals in trend. Whilst HA candles are awesome at identifying trend reversals etc, I am thinking a candle colour range (in theory anyway) should more easily identify the strength of a move and identify when momentum is slowing. This whole thread remains a work in progress, so stick around and join in and test out what is happening. You might find something useful!

Keeping a close eye on AUDUSD currently...price is struggling to get above Daily Open and Daily R1 PP. There is a clear downward trendline on the D1 which I am hoping will provide massive resistance where price is right now. H4 Stoch is well overbought also. The current H1 has just closed producing a nice doji right under the Daily Open. Will seek out Correl8 signals on multiple TF's after the current H4 candle closes before I decide which direction to take, but my current sentiment is bearish for AUDUSD.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Nice strong H4 bullish candle on AUDUSD with a nice strength separation on both H1 and H4 Correl8 indicator. Price has broken through a downward sloping trendline on the H4. See screenshot. Looking to buy AUDUSD off the M15 if confluent bullish signal occurs (will wait for possible retracement prior to any M15 signal).

Hello sir. I stumbled upon your thread will searching for 'strength separation forexfatory' on google. I have one question. Did you write contents in the pdf below? Attached File(s) SSS The Strength Separation Strategy.pdf 298 KB | 1,271 downloads Thanks for enlighting us with the systems (especially the iCorrel8 indicator).

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi there thanks for your interest. This thread has come to a standstill while I wait for a newly coded Correl8 indicator to be released. Good news though, I have received the prototype only last night and am in the testing phase. I have requested some minor tweaking and once I am satisfied it is functioning as it should I will be releasing the .ex4 file for others to investigate. In answer to your question however, yes I was the guy who wrote that document. It was written early on into my studies into the Correl8 indicator and since that time I have further refined my strategy. That .pdf file seems a little redundant to me now. Needless to say I will be releasing an updated strategy, hopefully within the coming month once I have everything ready. It is difficult timing for me currently as I am moving overseas on September 4th and right now everything is being sold off as we prepare to fly out. If you subscribe however you won't miss any updates. Stay tuned; there is plenty of exciting things in store to those who patiently wait.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
You're welcome. However that indicator pales in comparison with the re-imagined version i am soon to reveal. So please stay tuned and all will be releases hopefully in the coming week.

Â How the icorrel8 calculates it's data? Does it call for all related 7 pairs to the currency?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Great question but I have no answer for you, sorry...you would have to ask the developer, who is some anonymous person at mql5.com. I have only studied the indicator in great depth, so I understand how it "behaves" in different market conditions and what to look for in terms of entry and exit etc. I really have no idea what makes it "tick", but I am sure glad I found it!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I've come to this thread mainly because of the pdf in my post earlier. I want to learn more: When does a currency (or currencies) move? I've tried CCFp, CC, derivatives of them like CCFp Cvert CCFp-Diff and quite few others. I've also tried CSDash , MADDash , FFx USM , PSA for quite awhile. I've also made some custom indicator based on my understanding, but unfortunately i'm not using it currently because the data is redundant (at least for me). The latest attempt was: combining CCI of 28 pairs, and make them as a new 'currency strength meter'. It failed miserably as i see my excel sheet giving buy and sell signal every time candle closes. I jumped from one indicator to another. Here is my post on CCFp-Diff . And this is my trades based on PSA. The PSA is on real account. But, one way or another: I'm searching for better currency strength meter. That's why i have sooo many question about this iCorrel8. And when i put them in the chart, i know something that maybe worth to mention. It is quite different from CCFp or CC completely.

Hehe you seem as hungry about this as i have been. I started this thread initially as a simple shout out to attract someone to code a comprehensive alert for it. I have since become obsessed and am having great success with it. Like anything in this game, once you stick to one thing and stop bouncing from one thing to another you achieve a greater level of success. And if you spend enough time analysing how an indicator "behaves" in different market conditions you become better at reading market sentiment just through understanding the subtlest of indicator nuances. I am not saying that this is all you need in your toolkit, but it is a damn fine tool to keep in your arsenal. When do currencies move? When my alert tells me they are. Simple. I don't wait at the screen anymore - i wait for my phone to ping and then i enter. I get rewarded with pips for waiting for the signals. This is so simple i wish i had discovered it 10 years ago and not waste tons of time and money up to this point. I am using the correl8 indi in conjunction with pivots in particular, just to ensure I don't enter a buy when price is just below a PP, or the daily open etc. And i like using multiple TF analysis as a way of filtering out noise. I am scalping M1 using the M5 as a directional cue, and also keeping a watch on the M15 for an overall directional bias. I like Bollinger Bands as a measure of the volatility of a move also. This indicator excites the heck out of me and i have major plans in place to have it further developed and refined in a way that makes trading very visual and rewarding. If writing some code can make something that is visually easy to read and interpret and follow, then i am getting that code written. Try this as an idea: overlay two Correl8's, one with a 21 period iPRI and the other with an 89 iPRI. As long as there is a cross of the 89, trade a separation of 52 or greater on the 21 period in that same direction. Head for the nearest PP or psych level etc with a really tight stop. Trade during periods of higher liquidity. You won't be sorry! More to come very soon. Don't forget to subscribe to ensure you receive any updates I send out. When do currencies move?

Yes you got my attention. And now i'm glued to this thread. The reason behind jumping from one indicator/system is i'm doing some soul-searching. I believe that we're not the same. We're learning same trading system, but later we interpret it on our own. We put this indicator. We put another rules to ourself. That's why innovation born. George C lane with his stochastics in 1950s, Welles Wilder with his Parabolic SAR, RSI, ATR and ADX in 1978. So keep them coming. I hope i'm not interrupting this thread. I have no earlier info about this indicator called iCorrelate8. This is how i see them. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The first thing i saw was: the value of JPY in GJ and UJ is the same! I've answered my own question: Attached Image Hehehe. I will further explain this wonderful indicator. And maybe you can comment more as we moving on? Maybe create a new thread if you think it is disturbance in this thread?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
A few weeks ago I discovered the iCorrel8 in this thread and I am obsessed, too! I use it for selection of the pair to trade: looking at the 1H iCorrel with all curr to see the strong and weak and the coming crosses of the lines (here it would be nice if the curr were listed on the right side from strong to weak and if there would be a second timeframe to show longer/shorter term numbers). I think it's the best strenght meter I've seen! I trade on renko charts, see pic. If price is under pink line I look for iCorrel8 iPRI 5 to come above 26 and place sell stop below last candle low. If price is above pink line vice versa. I use pivots for targets or I use the TMA-channel (repaints) for quick scalps. Works with every candle size (with renko there is no timeframe). With longer term iPRI I'm testing. Thanks Kirk for this thread!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
This is exciting to me. Knowing how this indicator can be utilised as an integral part of ANY strategy. That looks like a really strong strategy you have developed there! I have always been fascinated by the idea of Renko, but have never taken the time to get renko charts set up. I love your screenshot where the EUR (34) has just "poked its head" above the USD indicating EUR strength and a possible shift to the upside. Thanks for sharing your ideas here - it is a fresh example of how flexible Correl8 indicator is and how it can be used as a powerful tool in ANY strategy.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hehe you are certainly not interrupting this thread. Your ideas and comments are valid and welcome. Keep them coming. I am glad you are showing a keen interest in how Correl8 can assist your trading.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi. Can you help mi to build iCorel with higher time frame - on your chart H4. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi ruma29 thanks for being here. I particularly like multiple TF analysis. Just as any indicator will show "underlying" conditions on larger TF's, the Correl8 does the same. Because I am a day trader (and a scalper at heart!) then I look for underlying strength on the H1 and M15, and trade the M1 and M5 in between pivot points. I am only after 10 or 20 pips a day so there is no need for me to look at longer TF's for capturing larger swings. So, to put it all together, and taking EURUSD as the example in the screenshots attached, as the H1 shows a cross, I turn to the M15 and look at the actual strength of the cross there. The lines have a value that is displayed both in the indicator window, and of course in the data window. Based on the separation of these lines, I turn to the M5 and M1 to look for an entry. The strength of the Correl8 line separation is very similar to a Bollinger Band expansion. If the outside bands of a BB are separating at a wide angle, you know there is volatility in the current move, regardless of the TF. So, 1) H1 cross (no values required, just eyeball it); 2) M15 cross (same, no values required, just need a visual); 3) M5 cross with combined separation greater than 26, and; 4) M1 separation greater than 52. I will not sell when price is just below a PP or Daily Open / psych level (and vice-versa). I wait for a break / pull back and enter on next signal. See screenshots. There are many examples of this happening each day, and if the signals are getting sent to your phone, there is no need to sit at the screen. EDIT: Please note this is NOT my current strategy...it forms the basis of it, but I have added some refinements which will be revealed in the coming weeks as I release the latest strategy development. The trade example shown in the screenshots are just one example of how using multiple TF analysis can be beneficial using the Correl8 indicator.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Kirkleaforex, Thank you for your effort to respond...I will review it and spend some time on this indicator...

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Strom...sure I will post a screenshot showing a possible example of a H4 trade on EURUSD. Hopefully this will help, but it is not just the Correl8 I am relying on here. If I was to blindly follow every Correl8 signal, I would run into trouble. In this example, notice how price has broken outside of the Bollinger Band. It is never a good idea to enter a trade at this point, as price will almost always retrace back to within the bands unless the move is exceptionally strong. Also, price had just run into a Pivot Point, which may have caused price to reverse. So in the screenshot example I would have waited until price broke above the next PP and retraced and tested the same PP as support before entering long. End result is 120 pips or so, which is great considering your SL could have been a narrow 15 pips - great R:R. Best advice I can give is to wait patiently for the market to reveal a sweet setup, and not chase trades which may not be there. If you are trading H4 charts, then taking chances on setups that aren't the best really puts your capital at risk. I hope this example helps...ask any other questions you like, I am here to help if I can.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
You are welcome, but at the end of the day, the Correl8 indicator is yours to do with as you please. Everyone will have a different interpretation of how it fits into their personal trading style and strategy. I love how it seems to work for me and how clearly I am able to see and interpret the signals I am given, but others just might not see it how I do...and that's okay. I hope you find something of value in here to help you.

Guys I am leaving my house today to spend the next 9 days in an Air BnB before I fly out to Thailand on September 4th. The Air BnB place does not offer WiFi so I may be unable to reply to your questions in a timely manner. I apologise for this but I assure you I will answer every question as quickly as I can. Having said that, I am really enjoying seeing how the Correl8 indicator is working for other people. So please feel free to share your ideas, strategies and screenshots - the more the merrier.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Kirk This thread is looking good, appreciate the work you are putting in, could you post the Correl indicator that you are using at present. Thank you Regards

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Thank you so much sir for those kind comments! I'm interested if the indicator/technique able to 'read' all 28 pairs movement as i'm scalping for a few pips here and there. Hi MeLe. I don't know which version did he use. You can see the attachment -paper clip icon above this thread. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As for me, i use another correl indicator from mladen. It is mtf - multiple time frame. For example, if you're on m15 chart you can see higher tf, such as m30, h1 or h4. It is the same if you're on m1. You can see any correl above m1 like m5, m15 and so on. It does not repaint - it wait for higher tf to complete its course. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Please see those 2 green vertical lines carefully. You can see that to complete 1 hr, we need 4 m15 candles. Started with a straight line, at last 15min the line will sloping up/ down. Here is the indicator. Attached File(s) correl8_1.mq4 16 KB | 860 downloads

Hey there and thanks for stopping by! Currently i am testing a new prototype and there are some bugs and omissions that need fixing; stuff i originally requestedfrom the programmer which was not completed. Functionality is almost there but not quite so i will hold off posting an incomplete indi until i am certain it will perform as intended. Hoping to have this within the coming weeks. Thanks for your interest. Please subscribe to be sure of getting update notifications.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi again...i am using this only on the majors as i like to limit my spread to 2 pips or so. But in the settings you can turn individual currencies on and off so you get every combination available. One idea i am investigating is creating a matrix style indicator which shows the previous candle separation value for ALL 28 pairs, for ALL time frames, with user input to select specific pairs / TFs to be shown. I expect this to visually look like a kind of "heat map" with colour-coded variables depending on the volatility of the separation. This could then be an immediate visual MTF reference for whatever pairs you are interested in. But, all this takes time and money. For now it is just an idea worth pondering... Last point i will make though is in relation to my re-working of the existing Correl8. It now shows the individual line values of the previous candle and not the "repainting" values of current candle, which i think is a welcome change.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
It reminding me to one of the long-known system here in ff back in 2008. Trading system using relative strength . The rules were pretty simple: I learned a lot about CCFp, CC from there. Correl8 is much better in some aspect than CCFp. CCFp only calculates 7 pairs - all is USD pairs. But Correl8 calculates all 28 pairs. If somebody using a br0ker without 28 pairs, you can't use Correl8. Instead, use CCFp. But, COrrel8 lack some customization. Being said, CCFp can be edited on many ways. It can be faster, it can be slower. It can be more inertial if you find your settings correctly. About the last line: It now shows the individual line values of the previous candle and not the "repainting" values of current candle, which i think is a welcome change. In other words, are you using difference value of 2 closed reading before this? Something like this?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Take your time. Current indicator is good and more than enough. It depends on how people interpret the data.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Thank you, will wait for your final system completed, Regards

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks redwood, I will check it out. The one that I wanted is not available in the paperclip. Take care, Regards

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #303 ---
OK I finally have the finished product and will be testing madly whenever I have spare time and an internet connection! Early days but I am dead impressed with how this is picking up signals. As a teaser, check out the screenshot of XAUUSD a short time ago. This picked up around 45 pips in 30 mins. Hope to share this all with you within the coming week.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Wow. I'm looking forward to this! Sir. If you could explain, how does this Correl differs from the basic form of the Correl? Or should i wait? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Its better to wait. I'm sure K will explain everything as usual. Well comeback K. Cheers. Merka

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I'm just eager to know more. If you look some signals from eurgbp yesterday and today. For sure you will caught those large moves..

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks for showing a keen interest redwed. All will be revealed very soon, but for now i will briefly outline the major changes: 1) There is an EntryTriggerValue user input field where you can choose your own SDV (combined separation distance value); 2) A MinSDVPercentValue allows you to choose a percentage change in SDV from Candle1 (previous candle) to Candle 0 ( current candle). Note that these two entry triggers are automatically linked. Default entry trigger is 52 and default percent change trigger is 40%. 3) An exit alert which calculates the SDV of the lines as they contract back within a certain SDV 4) Arrows on chart for signal display, complete with arrow size and colour input fields; 5) A complete array of alert functionality including Push Notifications for your mobile phone. One very important thing worth mentioning is that this has been designed to be use with a single pair only. If you have all pairs showing there with be alerts triggered left right and centre and arrows everywhere. If you really like to show all pairs then i suggest a separate chart window and use the original Correl8b etc. I hope this works for people as well as it is working for me. It is important to realise though that this is no magic bullet; there is a technique to using it which i will outline shortly. Have a great day everyone!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Looking forward to your updated strategy.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Looks neat. About point number 2. Does this mean MinSDVPercentValue differs from EntryTriggerValue? In other words we can get two signals from this? a: when our preferred SDV activated? b: when there is 'change' from 52+40% (of 52)? Do you think if we open all 7 main pairs (USD pairs), we can decipher all 28 pairs movement? Another indicator - CCFp was created only involving USD pairs to scan all 28 pairs. Maybe we can peg all other currencies to USD to 'scan' all 28 (like CCFp does). Trading is simple, but not easy. Take a look at the advice following. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trading takes time, and no single system will help you if too do not take time and learn what trading is all about.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
When you decide to make trading easy, it will be easy.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thanks for the advice and i respect for what've you taught here in ff. But we're meant to be different. Many people do naked chart trading. Many people trade based on indicators. They are people who gain 5 pips per day. They are people who gain 100 pips per day. Some of them even more. And there left some people who always ended up negative. Some people trade 28 pairs. Some people trade 1,2 pairs. Some people martingale. Some people do hedging. And there are always some people searching for that 'holy grail' ea. It's not only being in profit. Some of them like to explore ways of doing things. It is a great journey for us. (But there are some people keep jumping from one system/indicator/technique to one another and hoping that the system/indicator/technique/guru/thread starter idea's will work for him/her). If it's only as simple as that , life would be dull. Once you reached the top, no improvement can be made. And one are forced to follow whatever others have to say.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi there...minSDVPercentValue does not provide a signal in its own right, but acts as an additional filter on the EntryTriggerValue alert. When i release the indi for testing, try changing the values of each field and see how it affects the alerts being triggered. My logic was that when there is a separation of 52 or greater, and the difference in SDV from one candle to the next is at least 40%, this suggests volatility and may offer a better entry signal. They seem to work well at the values i have set as default, but it all deserves a rigourous test. Regarding your question of scanning all 28 pairs through using all USD pairs on the Correl8, i simply have no clue as i have only ever used it on single pairs. It is certainly something you should look into when you get it.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Agreed with your statement. I'll wait for the final product to be released. Later i'll explain '28 pairs' problem, maybe in pm to avoid confusion among the members and keep the thread on its track. Again, thank you for showing me this indicator! Very grateful for this.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
PM me anytime. But i don't mind you sharing your ideas here...always up to share ideas and learn a little more myself.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thank you for giving me chance to 'speak' on your thread. It's a comfort, knowing that the thread starter was so open with the idea of learning from others. I will not open a new thread as i found this is a great place to share what i 'see' from this indicator called Correl8. (You can search google, but there is not much information.) I hope this is not disturbance for the way this thread works and the focus is on Correl8 and not other supplementary indicators in my chart. So, let's begin. Here is my indicator. Attached File(s) correl8_1.mq4 16 KB | 756 downloads And here are the parameter inputs. Attached Image I set them to 42. (Oh 1 thing worth mentioning. I didnt read this thread from page1, but i only read the pdf. I'll not repeat them, please download them from the paper clip icon above this thread.) Here is my screen. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I set up EURGBP and GBPAUD m15, same time 25-Aug-2016. With standard Correl8, i only change 42 in the iPRIPeriod. No other changes. Can you spot any difference/similarities between those two? Better yet, this is the bigger scale, same correl. Attached Image (click to enlarge) What do you see from those two pictures?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
@redwed: the correl-line from GBP is the very same, since it's the same timeframe. The correl is calculated not only from the price in the chart above it (as most indicators), it's the strength of the GBD against all other big currencies.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hello friend! I need some help, plese tell me how can make the indicator belowe. I think that I've got all indicators. Thank you for help..

--- 帖子 #318 ---
That is Correl mtf. Look carefully at upper left. I'm mtf h1 into m15. That's why the shape is 'funny'.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
That's quite good. If we're looking GBP, we're actually looking for 'entire' GBP. It is composed by GBPUSD, GBPNZD, GBPCHF, GBPCAD, GBPJPY, GBPAUD and EURGBP. I don't know about the calculation, but it seems consistent across all the charts i've opened. And it is meaningful too. But, that's half of the story. Another questions come in. Are you sure the GBP correl lines are the same? Can you explain more on that? (im not english speaker, so i'm very poor in my grammar).

--- 帖子 #320 ---
@redwed Yes, the GBP correls are the same... the values on the scale prove it. The higher the values, the stronger the respective currency. The higher the distance between the lines, the more trending should appear. Not sure what other question comes in? I would be interested in how the correls are calculated.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
yes. the values on the scale prove it. That is the 'key'word im watching for. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Above picture show a few things: GBP weak and its lowest is -38. Euro is 43. While AUD at the same time reached 66 (also lowest extreme -66). Attached Image (click to enlarge) And the second one is when we attach AUD altogether with EUR and GBP.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
More questions. Who is the most volatile for the time being? Which pair among the eurgbp, gbpaud, euraud is the most 'valuable' to trade? And why?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
The most volatile in this example was AUD. There were the highest and lowest values. For selection of the pair I trade I use a higher timeframe and look for divergent lines, or crosses of lines. I don't look for the pairs with the most different values, because it maybe the move is over. For me it is more important that one line goes north, the other south, the steeper, the better. I imagine this battle with driving a car. The line goes up --&gt; the currency accelerates, the steeper the line, the more power. If it goes down it brakes. Near the 0-line there is no power. If you look at a chart with all correls you see often that one currency follows the other or all go one side except USD. I like this currency-meter! If I'm in a trade it gives confidence to stay in the trade as long the stacking of the lines is ok, even they loose difference.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Good explanation. Here's my version. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I put 3 lines labelled 1, 2, 3. 1 is when GBP hitting down hard and AUD remain at the top. Sell GBPAUD is very likely. Second option is Buy EURGBP. 2 Trade number 1 closed and we're looking to Buy EURAUD. GBPAUD will be second choice. Buying EURAUD is my decision while EUR in the upper side compared to GBP. 3 Second trade closed and no trade for the rest of the day, not much volatility. And here's the verdict. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sell GBPAUD - 48 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buy EURGBP - 38 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buy EURAUD - 4 pips - I admit the exit was a bit late, since Correl shows 'contraction' earlier than point number 3. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buy GBPAUD will caught us in whipsaw market. Beside all these trades, we can take many trades based on other currencies movement. For me, it is paradise for scalpers like me. One can really do some high speed scalping with this indicator.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I'm impressed about your in-deep knowledge of currency strength-meter. Have you ever analyzed daily charts? cheers. Merka

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Thank you. Where can I find this indicator?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Read #295

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I appreciate your compliments. I believed most currency strength meter (CSM) was not built for higher tf, especially daily and above. Default settings in most CSM is focusing for scalping on lower tf. However you can change the parameter according to your own preferences. You can read my posts and you'll know why i'm onto this Correl indicator. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The main element of trading multipairs: know your 28 pairs. And make sure your br0kers offer them. Get fluent, which one is the base, which one is the quote. If AUD get stronger, you need to buy AUDUSD, but sell GBPAUD. If JPY getting weaker, we will sell JPY, but we will buy EURJPY, GBPJPY, and AUDJPY.

Hi everybody. A added Correl MTF and it's show nothing. Have you got any ideas? Thank a lot!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Strom yes the indo can be a little buggy. Try the following: 1) Change TF to anything else and change back again...if this doesn't work then; 2) Try zooming right out as far as you can so the chart candles are at their smallest, then right click and select "Indicators", then double-click on the correl8 that you have added (M5 Correl8 at the bottom), and then just click ok. It should then appear on your chart and you can zoom back in to what candle size you prefer. This has worked for me in the past - I hope it fixes your situation. Rest assured the latest version I am about to release has fixed this issue. I will endeavour to have this out to people soon so you no longer have these issues.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
If you are using a broker that has a suffix to the ending of your Currency, then it wont work. I have modified the MTF version and added an input so you can add your suffix and it will work. For example, Attached Image Download: Attached File(s) correl8_1_SUFFIX.mq4 17 KB | 748 downloads

Still don't work... Look at it.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Â Maybe you don't have all eu m15 history? Try refreshing your chart (change tf a few times).

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Strom, Your pair is EURUSD with no SUFFIX, you don't need my version, and if you want to use it, remove the "i" from the suffix input. Like redwed said, try more data or something. Also, after fixing your suffix issue, change timeframes and it should work. Like go to 5 min, then back to 1 min, and it should show up. See my screenshot below. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks xfactor. Unfortunately it doesn't work at all. No indicator at all in the indicator window. Just like Redwed's post above.

Sorry for jumping the gun. It works for a max setting of 4000 bars. I tried this on a 30 minute time frame chart. I really think this itself is very good. Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hello and welcome! I'm unsure about the "holy grail" reference (lol) but if this is used correctly there's certainly nothing preventing you from making a decent return. Like anything in this game, we can't afford to be always "in the market", taking every signal that comes along. Waiting patiently for a strong signal does pay off big time, so please use this responsibly as just one part of an overall strategy, where trade management and psychology form the bulk of your system. My own strategy is slowly being written and should be ready within the coming week. I prefer to do it this way so people have an immediate reference point on how this indicator has been redesigned and how it has worked for me, and not fly blindly into trading it and making mistakes like i did.

Tried it with 1500 on m15. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Still got zero divide problem. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe it's not for me. Never mind, solved it. It is the 'suffix'.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I think your problem is that you have suffix setting at "i". Try leaving it blank since your chart doesn't show any suffix.

The problem is: XAUUSD......many brokers haven't this symbol.....u have to change xauusd with symbol for GOLD.....in my case is "GOLD"

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I cant wait to see the updated indicator and the strategy, its very nice of you to share both with us. Thanks in advance!

hi kirkleaforex, did you tried CCFp instead of correl8 for currency pairs?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi there...yes i have tried every CSM and Correlation indi i could get my hands on. For whatever reason, i decided that the Correl8 is the one I would spend my time and effort getting to know. Very glad i did now! Hope it helps you as much as it has helped me. Please consider subscribing to the thread and you won't miss important updates to my trading strategy and a totally reworked Correl8 indicator which i have planned to release this weekend.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hello Darryl! Do you trade with arows? Thank you

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi Kirk, I don,t use the correl 8 as a stand-alone indicator. I rely on candlestick patterns, the 9 ema, PSAR

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hey Darryl haven't heard from you in quite a while. Are you still trading the Correl8? That looked like a great system you posted all those weeks ago! Hope things are on the up and up for you.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
That's wise! Nothing works in isolation. Just like we humans can't exist in isolation, an indicator needs good support strategy around it to assist in clarifying the clear trading opportunities from the mess. We welcome all trading methods here, where the Correl8 is one integral part of something bigger. Feel free to post a scteenshot of your setup for the benefit of others. Green pips to all.

Hi Kirk, I don't use the correl 8 as a stand-alone indicator. I rely on candlestick patterns, the 9 ema, PSAR and Ferru FX's currency strength meter to pick my trades. The correl 8 and QQE are superb complements and give me great confidence in pulling the trigger. I trade the 15M time-frame and set my profit target at 10 pips only. I thank you for your magnanimity in sharing your knowledge. God bless you.

Hello, a small idea (how to use correl8 + qqe for scalping) 5 min chart Icorrel8 (34, high-low-close) QQE (Hull MA, SF 34 / RSI 55) - use this for more volatile pair like GU. You can play with the settings for every pair, in fact its better for every pair to have its own setting depending on the rhythm of the pair. QQE signal (cross) only valid if supported by iCorrel8: The stronger currency must be above +25 line with at least 50 units separating from weakier curr, the more the better (having one curr above 25 and another below -25 is very strong signal). Any signal with iCorrel8 not supporting it (e.g. correl still showing the opposite strength of currencies) is invalid. Further confirming of signals: 15M QQE signal confluence (using 2 QQE's with different settings, if signals show up on the same candle (or on 2 candles following each other), it further supports the move) Example of 15M QQE settings: QQE1 (Hull, 21, 55) QQE2 (IE/2, 13,34). You can use the same technique for 5min (so QQE signals confluence together with iCorrel8). IF QQE signal appears with iCorrel8 not supporting it, wait till iCorrel8 shows proper values (so going above 25 with 50+ separate value). Obviously all the settings are still being tuned and i believe better values can be found for QQE. For iCorrel8 i find 34 period (5min) to be quite accurate. This is still work in progress but can give you an idea how to use it. Having a correl8 indi with alarms (separation value, above 25 line) would be great. You can find valid signals using these settings on majors (not crosses!) every day.

Any updates on this system?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
OK people, finally I have a moment to get back in touch with this whole thing and offer you what some of you have been PM'ing me for over the past few weeks. Please accept my apologies for not being here and providing regular updates...rest assured everything is up and running again and I am excited to be sharing with you not just the re-worked Correl8 indicator, but a great trading strategy which I think you will enjoy using. So without further ado, let's get into it! Firstly - the updated Correl8 indicator...I have renamed this the Strength Separation indicator, or SS for short. This reflects the fact that what the indicator actually offers us is an alert based upon the strength of the separation of the two individual currency lines. This value I refer to as the SDV , or Separation Distance Value . People who have been following this thread will know all about this. The indicator has been updated in several ways: 1) Changes to the SDV can be made in the indicator settings dialogue box...it is called EntryTriggerValue. 2) I have included the Percentage Change in SDV input fireld...a theoretical input value, which admittedly has not impressed me much, but it is there for testing. Again, if you have been following the thread you will have read about my attempt to code in something to measure the percentage change in SDV from one candle to another. It was my premise that a % change of 40 or greater represented a decent enough upswing in volatility for a signal to be considered "more valid", and I was including this input as a possible trade filter. The reason I included this is I was seeing signals which weren't leading anywhere, and thought this may have been the solution. So, try it out, but as I said a moment ago, I feel it is fairly redundant, and a little "buggy". It is found in the settings dialogue box under EntryMinSDVPercent . 3) I have included various alert functionality, including: a) on screen arrows - BUY and SELL arrows can be individually set to different colours; b) screen popup alert; c) sound alert; d) Push notifications; e) Mail alert Additionally, there is a "Show Arrow" setting, in case you don't want additional "clutter" on your screen. And there is an ExitTriggerAlert in the settings dialogue box, which again is something I thought at the time was a "bright idea" but in hindsight probably wasn't. As the currency lines converge after an initial separation, the SDV values narrow, and the theory was that if the SDV values narrow to within a certain range, an exit signal would alert me to consider an exit. Yeah, well, as always some things are great in theory, but in reality they don't account for much...try it out though and see if it works for you. I was trying a value of "30". 4) I have had a " MaxBarsBack " feature included, as sometimes the sheer amount of data calculation going on can be CPU intensive. I set this to around 250-300 bars, which seems plenty enough to cover most of the screen (depending on how far in and out you have the screen zoomed). And from what I can tell there are no bugs anymore like there were prior to now. Everything else is fairly standard. I have been using an 89 period as the iPRI value. This may sound like a "slow" approach to generating signals, but in reality it is proving a decent value for getting in without it being too early. It seems pretty responsive to volatile price fluctuations, so having it set that high / slow actually works ok. OK...now for the Strategy! Time Frame: I am personally trading the 1 minute chart (forever a scalper (t heart I'm afraid!) but this has the potential to be traded on any TF. I am changing this strategy up again, but this time I feel it is more simple, and I am now using the following indicators: a) Heiken Ashi Smoothed indicator at a value of 233 (Fib number - I love 'em!) This is used as a trade direction filter...buy when price is above, sell when price is below; b) Winner indicator - with an 89 period and with a smoothing average of 5 . This is a recent addition to my toolkit, and is replacing the QQE. I have level lines placed at the mid-level 50, and at 15 and at 85. If price is above the 233 HA Smoothed , I buy when the Winner histogram bar climbs out of the 0-15 zone , or sell when price breaks down from above the 85-100 zone , and ride it as far as I can, (but more on the exit strategy later). c) I have another HA Smoothed indicator, this time using a fast period of 3 . I have added alerts to this, namely screen popup, sound and Push notification. If price is above the (233) HA Smoothed, I buy when there is a change in the 3 priod HA Smoothed, and ride it as far as I can. d) I have the Daily Open indicator showing. If price is above the Daily Open, I tend to have bullish sentiment, and vice-versa...it all depends on where price is in relation to the 233 HA Smoothed etc. I also refuse to trade when price is within a 5 pip range of the Daily Open, as price will likely "faff around" this level for a while before making up its' mind. It is when price is in this 5 pip range that I pay particular attention to the SS alerts! e) I am introducing the RenkoStreet Channel indicator (available by searching Google...I don't think there is nothing proprietary about it, although there is only the .ex4 available). I have been using it on Renko charts but its' primary purpose for me is for setting a dynamic Stop Loss. If traders like staring at the screen, then they can move the SL as the Renko Channel moves with price, slowly locking in more and more profit until price reverses and hits the SL at the channel boundary. I love this indicator, and although I am aware there are others out there similar, I haven't been bothered trying to find one as this one does what I need it to. I also use it for entry, when price breaks above a recent high or below a recent low. These high / low swing points can be easily recognised by the coloured semafor on the channel boundaries. f) And of course there is the Strength Separation (SS) indicator we all know and love. I am not relying on one or another indicator in isolation, but rather ALL together in confluence with each other: - I need the SS indicator to alert me to volatility and separation of one currency against the other; - I need price to be above / below the 233 period HA Smoothed for a BUY / SELL...this gives me the bias or sentiment for the trade; - I need the 3 period HA Smoothed to be signaling a BUY / SELL - I need the Winner indicator crossing up from below the 15 level line for a BUY, or crossing down from above the 85 line for a SELL. (Occasionally I might take a cross of the 50 level line for either direction, but more on that later); - and I use the RenkoStreet channel indicator as a potential entry trigger, but mainly as a dynamic Stop Loss. If ALL of the above signals are in agreement with each other, I pull the trigger, and not before. Targets. A matter of personal taste I know. I used to use Pivot Points as an option, and might still do so going forward, but to be honest the indicators I have referred to above will tend to show when price is stalling, and any one of them can be used to determine when to exit a trade. So these days I rely upon targeting an exit signal as my TP level, and not so much an actual pre-defined level. This way it is more dynamic and overall it seems a better option for me personally. I will post a few screenshots shortly showing entries and exits. Lastly, and most importantly, the best trading filter out there are the following major dot points: - do not trade more than 2-3% equity on any one trade - do not trade at least 15 minutes prior to / following a news event - as this strategy is based on exploiting a volatile separation of one currency away from another, the best sessions to trade are the sessions that offer the best market volatility, i.e. London / NY etc. So please do your due diligence and test this strategy by being sensible with these above considerations always in mind. I have included all indicators and template files in a .rar package. These have been saved exactly as I use them, so they are ready to test right out of the gate. But I do recommend testing on a demo, of course, until you are familiar with the strategy. Needless to say I am protective of the source code and so I have only posted the .ex4 files. Please respect my decision to do this. Literally hundreds of hours have gone into the thought behind the programming and I don't want it changed without my consent. Best of luck to you and have fun. Feel free to post any results you get, but try to keep things positive, in keeping with the vision that I have for this thread. Any negativity will result in a swift ban; there's just no need for it. Basically, when this strategy is used properly, there is no reason you shouldn't be able to pull pips out of the market at will. If you can't then there is something you are not doing right; the strategy itself is sound. All the best! Screenshots to come...

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Welcome back Kirk It has been a while. I'll look into your upgraded strategy and I'm sure it will be profitable as before. Cheers Merka

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Example 1 - screenshot of a potential SELL on USDJPY today. In the screenshot, price is already below the Daily Open, AND below the 233 period HA Smoothed, therefore I am looking for a sell. I get a nice signal from the SS indi at the same time as the 3 period HA Smoothed changes to a sell, and the Winner indicator is in the 85-100 (overbought) zone. I sell at the close of the candle after it breaks below this 85 level line. SL is placed at the recent swing high, as indicated by the Channel indicator red semafor. In this instance I wait for any exit signal from any of the indicators, and move my SL each time there is a change in the upper channel boundary. I eventually close my position when there is a ZERO-LINE cross by the yellow JPY value line in the SS indicator. 4 pips plus spread would have been the overall risk in hindsight, and about 20 pips in profit overall. NOTE: I am not going to take the following BUY signal from the Winner indicator, as price is still below the Daily Open and the 233 period HA Smoothed...only SELLS allowed...

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Example 2 - a potential SELL on EURUSD earlier today. Price is below Daily Open and is also below 233 period HA Smoothed, so I am considering SELLS only. We get a nice signal from the SS indi at the same time as there is a change in the 3 period HA Smoothed and the Winner is in the 85-100 and showing weakness. We can't win them all, and this trade falls flat, probably breaking even at best. We can consider a re-entry as we see the Winner histogram cross above the 50 level line and then below again and shortly after that we get another great SS SELL alert, so we enter our sell, and ride it. Exit is again when the SS USD value line crosses the ZERO mid-point.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Example 3 - An example of when to STAY OUT Price is meandering...it is above the 233 period HA Smoothed, so we may be looking to BUY, but it is not far below the Daily Open, so we stay away until there is a clear signal one way or the other. Shortly after there is a break above the Daily Open, but the Winner indicator is already peaking in the overbought zone above 85...need to sit aside and wait for another BUY opportunity.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Example 4 - NOW we can BUY... Just after the NO TRADE example above, we did get a valid BUY signal. Price was above the Daily Open and above the 233 period HA Smoothed, there was a nice SS alert, a change in the 3 period HA Smoothed, and the Winner was showing signs of breaking above the oversold zone. Exit was again when the USD SS value line crossed below the ZERO mid-point. Around 20 pips. You can start to see how it is perfect when ALL of these indicators line up together, but any 1 of them in isolation may have produced a false signal.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Last post before I head to bed...the SS signals in the examples above came from a setting of 34 as the SDV. I encourage people to play with this value with different currency pairs and see what works for them. 34 seems a fair "average" for decent signals across all pairs, but I am sure this can be fine tuned for your faves. Lastly, there will be the occasional decent signal on non-MAJOR pairs, but perhaps not as often as on the MAJORS. I am only trading the majors due to the lower spreads and higher number of signals I am getting from the SS indicator. Good night and good luck. EDIT: IF you like what you see here and are getting results, please consider subscribing so you get alerted to any updates as they come out. Cheers!

Thanks for new updated rules. Much appreciated. I would like if you could clarify few things I am confused a little about. In your post #365 you said - I have been using an 89 period as the iPRI value. b) Winner indicator - with an 89 period and with a smoothing average of 5 . This is a recent addition to my toolkit, and is replacing the QQE. I have level lines placed at the mid-level 50, and at 15 and at 85. But on your screenshots you use not 89 but 34 iPRI value and on Winner not 85 level but 90. What is then correct? Thank you for all your contribution.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Yeah sorry about that, mate. Check out the attached update of the Winner indicator...when I took that screenshot I was probably experimenting with the (34) value and not realising I hadn't changed it back. Apologies for the confusion. The code has been changed so that it is (89) period now also, where before it was (10) period. I have added in lines at 15 / 50 / 85 in the code so you can drag and drop into a new window and they are there already. To be honest though, I am experimenting all the time, and the 15 and 85 lines are just guides, you might find that 10 and 90 work better, or 80 and 20. Typical overbought / oversold zone conditions really...and it is a bit RSI like also, i.e. when you notice the histogram crossing the 50 from below, you can use it as a buy signal on top of everything else etc. As long as all signals agree with each other, there should be no dramas.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Cheers mate and thanks for sticking around while I was M.I.A. Good luck with everything.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi mate, the QQE I am no longer using, but if you are, that's cool...you can find it in the downloads section, along with that version of the Correl8 from ages ago. But I recommend staying up to date with what I am doing, as the signals I am getting from my latest strategy are firing better than ever.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hey guys, a quick indicator update for you all...the guy I now have on board is quick off the mark and is helping me sharpen this baby up. So now, here are the mods: 1) a 50 level line as a better visual reference of where individual currency lines are in relation to the mid-point; 2) bold blue ticks as a buy signal / bold red ticks as a sell signal 3) green crosses which indicate when one currency line crosses over the zero mid-point, indicating a potential exit (exhaustion of momentum). As I am finding the existing ExitTriggerValue settings a bit redundant, I may delete these in future versions. Siilarly, the EntryMinSDVPercent code may be deleted from the existing code, as it isn't firing at all as well as I had imagined it would. That's it for now...more to come shortly!

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hold on to your hats, I am having a slight bug fixed up as I write this...will upload update when I have it ready...

--- 帖子 #385 ---
OK, try this: Prior to now, if there was a "X", there was no subsequent signal alert until an opposite signal was alerted... NOW, once there is an "X", it effectively cancels the prior signal, and "resets" the indicator...all new signals are now showing. This is kick-ass...

--- 帖子 #386 ---
here is example on GBPUSD from today...is this a valid short trade?...the only thing I am not sure about is Winner, which is coming down from above 85 but by the time the SS has given signal the Winner was already below 50. SL would be placed just above last red circle of REnkoStreet which is 17pips + spread. Exit when green line on SS crosses below 0 level. Or what else would make you exit? What about change in heiken3? If HA3 used then profit would be +27pips. Or if having fixed TP for 1:2 risk:reward then this would be +38pips. I guess everyone needs to find what he prefers how to take profits. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Perfect setup! Yeah the Winner is probably something that will take some getting used to...I reckon as long as it is out of the overbought zone and heading down you are in the clear...but I would not be selling if it had already reached the oversold zone etc. Nice work mate! Now go and download the recent indicator updates and apply them to your chart and see whether there is any difference to your experience...they should offer better functionality...I am hoping EDIT: Forgot to address your question regarding potential exit methods...I would consider using the renko channel boundary as a dynamic SL. Trouble is you need to be at the screen to monitor this. But whilst ever price is below the 3 period HA Smoothed you should stay in. Alternately, you could add an additional HA Smoothed at a slower speed, say 8, and use them like moving averages, i.e. exit at a crossover. By the time this happens however, the SS would have already crossed the zero mid-line prior...so my guess is the SS would be the better option if the Renko channel boundary hasn't stopped you out.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I will be setting up a new forward test Trade Explorer over the weekend and starting live trading next week. I will only be trading the MAJORS, for the reasons I have explained already. I am starting small...$100 account with 0.01 lot size until I can show consistency and then will up it in small increments. I have faith in this strategy but not enough to risk blowing my account up over stupid decisions and high risk %'s. I will only be trading from London open through to NY open, then it's bed time. I encourage others to try this out on a demo and post their results and experiences. If there are bugs with the indicator/s let me know...I am really stoked to have an awesome programmer on board with me and he is lightning fast at getting me results that work right out of the box. So let me know. Let's work on this together and grow it into something meaningful.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
@kirkleaforex I have added newest indicators, looks like it doesn't show...maybe if you could make screenshot with description what was added to we can see visually and compare thanks I have a suggestion for SS indicator. Arrows are nice and big but for some traders it may be distracting. What if there was option to choose between arrow and colored bar? So instead of red/bearish arrow the candle would be colored (could be red as default). And similar for long signal.

Golden-way, there looks to be many "X" and ticks on that chart which shouldn't be there...these signals probably will disappear if you refresh your chart, or double-click on the indicator and then just press "OK". It just looks very cluttered at the moment with ticks and crosses everywhere that shouldn't be there and this method should hopefully help get rid of unnecessary clutter.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
hey buddy... ur icorrel is 89 , shouldnt it suppose to be 34 ? - yes kirklea i did the change tnx

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Â Hey mate...the iPRI period should be set to 89, however the EntryTriggerValue i use is around 34 or so.Â

--- 帖子 #398 ---
do u have the mq4 version mate?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Please read back through the last few days of postings since I posted the updated strategy. I will not be posting the .mq4 files and have already offered my reasons for this decision. Again, if people are interested in making changes to the existing indicators, make a list and request the changes here. If you disagree with this stance then move on to another thread.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi , am sorry for not reading ur descriptions but chill out mate.. u have a great system \good job\ and im not trying to make a change in it ! just interesting in play with different tools and ideas , keep it up man

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Sorry for taking the hard stance that I have, Golden-way...I mean no disrespect to you. I am very protective of the strategy and the countless hours and many $$$ spent on having the indicators coded the way I want them. I am just trying to keep this thread purely about testing the strategy and developing it in a controlled fashion. I see too many threads where everything has gotten off-track as people start introducing their own indicators and post their own modifications and this and that...it detracts from what I am trying to achieve. The other reason is that I realise that there are members out there who are trading this live and I feel a responsibility to them to have a uniform level of understanding of the strategy to help build their knowledge and confidence using the system and the indicators. I don't want people blowing their accounts and losing focus by jumping from indicator to indicator, trying out newly modified versions as they surface from other members. I am more than happy to listen to ideas and then incorporate them into an indicator update if I think they serve the overall strategy in a positive way. I am serious about building something here that is sustainable and profitable for those who are serious about staying the course. So again, forgive me taking the hard stance that I have...but if you have some suggestions for what you would like to see changed, I would love to hear them.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
@ Kirkeaforex, I want to thank you for sharing your system and the cool indicators. Your a very generous person, Thank you very much for the kindness. regards

--- 帖子 #403 ---
You are very welcome. Try them and see what you think and if you notice anything you would like to see changed in some way post a suggestion or PM me. All the best!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
To everyone reading this, I am announcing something very cool in the coming week or so, so stay tuned. If you would like to be automatically notified about this or indeed anything else on this thread as things develop, please consider subscribing and you will be notified each time there is an update. And again I encourage people who are using this strategy to post any results (preferably with screenshots so we can break it down), ask many questions and get involved. Now that I am living a "sedentary" life here in Thailand I have the time to be more involved with this thread and assist people who are keen to be here. To our success! Kirk.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hello kirk I know you are a scalper trading the M1 but could your indicators and strategy been used on larger time frame like daily? Are there any contraindications? Cheers. Merka

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Â Hey mate...the signals represent changes in volatility, as you would understand no doubt by now, so in my way of thinking they would apply on any TF. Obviously your SL would need to be a lot greater etc. But if you see a daily signal where all the indicators agree, especially after a period of consolidation, I would jump on it and ride it all the way to the bank.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Thanks kirk for all. Merka

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Some reflections on the Winner indicator... If you are in a trade, let's say a SELL, you will see the Winner indicator histogram heading down until it hits the overbought zone and eventually start climbing up again. If you notice that the histogram climbs up sharply, but PRICE ACTION is going up only slightly or going sideways, then you can reasonably assume that the downward momentum is still there. Understanding the nuances of each indicator and learning their behaviour might take time and patience, but it gives you more confidence in using them to inform your trading decisions.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
OK, another indicator update... The Strength Separation indicator. In its' form up until now there has been a slight bug in the logic, where the automatic exit signal (green cross) will fire off as soon as a currency line crosses the zero mid-line, regardless from which direction. Now imagine a great crossover on EURUSD and the cross itself actually occurs ABOVE the mid-line...we get our signal, a nice big red tick above our candle. Now, as the momentum builds and the separation of the lines widens, invariably the USD currency line will cross below the zero mid-point...and that's where the bug was. This cross was causing an exit signal to appear on the screen, when the logic states we should continue in the trade because momentum is still increasing as the lines continue to separate. The code was stating that ANY cross of the zero-line should trigger an exit alert...my bad! Anyway, this has been fixed now, and you can download the latest version below. It should clean up unnecessary clutter caused by unnecessary green crosses... FYI I am planning a further update later tonight, where the indicator will only send out an alert when price is on the correct side of the Daily Open, i.e. if price is above Daily Open, only buy signals will be alerted, and vice-versa. This will also have the feature which filters out signals when price is within a 5 pip range of the Daily Open line. This addition WILL be a user defined input, yes / no, just in case for whatever reason it doesn't work the way I imagine it should. Hopefully this will be ready within the next 3-4 hours, but if not, enjoy this latest update anyway...

Live trade AUDUSD. Have bought AUDUSD just now after a signal. All signals lined up, so let's see how it pans out. See screenshot. EDIT: DUH...FOMC in 15 minutes...note to self...spend less time on the thread, spend more time checking the calendar for news events...

@kirkleaforex I have a suggestion for SS indicator. Arrows are nice and big but for some traders it may be distracting and it is not clear to what candle it belongs. What if there was option to choose between arrow and colored bar? So instead of red/bearish arrow the candle would be colored (could be red as default). And similar for long signal and exit signal. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hey there...I have been thinking about coloured bars for quite a few months to be honest. Particularly a coloured bar for different ranges of SDV...and as the SDV widens it is reflected in the candle colour. In terms of arrow size you can change that in the settings but when you change the TF to something else and back again it will revert back to what is already coded. I will make a version that has smaller candles for now and add your other idea to the pile for my coding guy. Cheers for the input. Allow me a short while for the arrow size change.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Maybe instead of 'Nike sign' you could use proper arrow?

This is the best scalping strategy I have witnessed so far in the history of me being on FF. And let me tell you I have been on FF for nearly 8 yrs now. I have seen countless strategies and systems on FF even the longest running threads do not provide the kind of success that this method provides. I am so thankful to you kirkleaforex you have been so generous in your offerings. Finally I have gained a little confidence in my forex skills. I love you mate.

Hello thread, I would like to make an announcement. I am about to start another thread over this coming weekend to discuss a newer, simpler, better strategy that has been in development for a short while. It is based on what we already have going here, but there are some inherent differences, and as such I feel the best place for this is a new home. Also, it puts an end to any confusion caused by me as I continually "tweak" and play with my own strategy...there must be people who are asking "why does this guy change things all he damn time?!" The current strategy is about as good as it is going to get without further input from people who read the thread and are interested in its development. I work best when ideas are bouncing around. I will of course remain available for people reading this thread, and answer any questions and provide support to those that ask for it. It is not a case of me moving on, simply "branching out". I still intend to trade this existing strategy with a new trade explorer, which I will set up over this coming weekend. That way the results can be viewed, broken down and analysed...they should speak for themselves. Back to the new strategy however...it is simpler, cleaner, better. Results are incredible and it can easily be traded on any currency pair, not just the majors. The Strategy Outline is written up, the indicators and template file are ready to be zipped up...I just need to set up the new thread...which is booked in for this weekend. Please note however, the only files I will be posting for download are the .ex4. This time however it is because I simply don't have access to the mq4 files for some of the indicators. I will post the necessary link to the new thread here when all is ready. I promise you though, based on early indications and results, this is an exciting development that I cannot wait to share.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hello Kirkleaforex I have only just found your thread and I am looking forward to your new one. Thank you for what you have already posted plus what you are about to.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Thanks Kirkle, im gonna test it right away! Small thing, it looks like new SS is painting more than necessary amount of arrows (confirming the settings of indi will delete the unnecessary ones), but i will test more and i also didnt have the newest version of it on my chart. I will try to optimize it for the beast, which is lately GPBUSD (by far the best major to scalp). I got used to QQE (in fact, mladen did an amazing QQE update lately with incredible amount of settings) but it looks like winner is better for filtering out false trades. Also if possible, could you add that we can set our own code for arrows in SS? I prefer simple arrows. Another (but more complicated) thing could be working on signal confluence on different timeframes (1/5M), so that using just one indi could show arrows from different TFs (multi TF thing is already built in the indi). Thanks again for update!

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi Kirklea, thanks for your hard effort and willingness to share and help to others. There are only very few people like you in this f..ing forex industry. Hat off and green pips to you.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
first indi bug i noticed: HA smoothed 233 keeps the same default color when you change TFs so you can't use it with black background (which i prefer). Also looks like the X-bug in SS indi (when it crosses 0 line) is still happening. Indi has size 55,540KB.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hey guys i am just out at a restaurant will be back atthe screen in an hour or so to reply to everybody. I will have those updates on the SS available for you tonight some time. Happy trading session to all.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Did i not post the HA Smoothed indi mq4? This indi has no real bearing on things as it is purely a trade filter so i will dig that up later and post it so others can play with the settings in the source. As for the SS, i believe the latest version fixes this...will post this also and you can check.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
No, you posted all just .ex4 files. I believe i tried the latest version but i'll doublecheck again. Enjoy your meal.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Yes i noticed the huge number of arrows too...interim fix, as you rightly mentioned, is to call up the indicator settings dialogue box and then just hit "ok" which settles it down again ☺ Regarding arrow option in settings i will ask my coder to add this is for the next update. Unsure about the multi TF idea...not the idea itself, just the cost. Anything involving multi TF seems to cost a bit more for the time required in coding. If anyone reading this knows how to do it and wants to offer your services for love not money, PM me.Â A possible solution is to overlay the same period SS for the other TF and colour the arrows a different size / colour. Just a thought...see what you reckon. It can look a little too much like spaghetti but you can drag the window down so it is not visible and just rely on the arrows?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Yes its possible but you would have add variable identifier for arrows (similar to what is in QQE indi) otherwise one indi would overwrite the arrows from the other one. Don't worry about that, the arrow code is much easier and useful thing to add. It will be probably better to wait till you post your updated system and start working on it afterwards. Btw what doesn't seem to work is turning off the exit signals in the latest SS version, i got ShowExit set to off and still get x-arrows and alerts.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
The most incredible strategy I have seen. Up there with THV, Genesis and TMS. Well done mate. Won't be long until the masses take this up.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
OK, as promised... 1) HA Smoothed (233) period mq4 file so you can play with code and change how it looks for different screen backgrounds and whatever else...like I said, this indicator is not essential to the strategy in any capacity other than a potential trade filter, so I am happy to provide the mq4. 2) SS (89) modified ex4 file - this is the latest update with a Daily Open filter setting included. With this enabled, only buy signals will show on the screen when price is above the Daily Open, and vice-versa. According to the strategy, if price is above the Daily Open, there must have been be bullish sentiment to get it there, therefore the strategy considers taking only bullish signals to take advantage of the overall sentiment. This setting allows you to follow the strategy exactly as designed with the added benefit of having less arrows on the screen. Less arrows = less room for confusion / error! Hope this helps and works for you as designed...let me know if there are any bugs to iron out

--- 帖子 #429 ---
OK, you have me there...unsure what all that means to be honest! Variable identifiers etc is programming language...stuff I pay $$$ for I do have a version where I have personally stripped out all of the exit strategy code, which was an easy enough thing to do. It compiled at least! I consider the exit strategy logic to be fairly dodgy. Good in theory, i.e. as the SDV converges it signals weakness in the momentum etc, but not as straight-forward in real life. If you like I will throw it out there as a way around everything...the trade off is that you have no exit signal, (other than whatever personal exit strategy you might employ).

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Well that is high praise indeed...not entirely sure how true it is, but I like hearing it, so thanks! Welcome to the thread and please stick around for what's to come.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Yes please, thank you. Exit is the most discrete part of every trading system.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Here ya go! Forgot to add, another feature I added to this is a pip range filter from Daily Open line. Set it to 5.0, and the indicator will not display an alert whilst ever the price is within the 5.0 pip "no trade" zone. Handy feature to have, especially as the Daily Open can cause a lot of fuss and bother when price is hanging around it

--- 帖子 #433 ---
This indicator visualizes the daily candle in realtime, so you dont need to look for the daily open line, but you can immediately see if youre day is in a bullish or bearish sentiment. Maybe its helpful for someone, thanks for the great work! Keep it up! Greetz, TheJube.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Maybe its just me, but since the last ( Strength Separation (89) mod Daily Open filter and no exit.ex4 ) update, the exit option is gone?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Nice addition to the toolbox. Will try it out. Welcome aboard hope you stick around!

--- 帖子 #436 ---
This is just an option for people who are having difficulty with having the exit crosses all over the screen. Many people prefer to utilise their own exit strategy anyway...add to this the fact that the exit strategy built in to the SS initially is, at best, a little buggy, and a "no-exit" version of the indi may be useful for some people. Thanks again for posting that Daily Candle indi...looks very useful

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Alright, i understand it now, thanks! Yes, no worries, i have gathered alot of indicators in my 6 years of digging through ForexFactory, so if i see something where i can add an indi to it to add value to the strategy i will not hesitate to post it here Im looking forward to the new system too! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Sorry for not replying sooner...welcome to the thread. I hope you find what you are looking for here And yes, do pop over to the new one when it's ready...

Hi all...just a quick post to offer my personal reflection on jumping around from indicator to indicator / strategy to strategy. I have traded for close to 11 years all up, and have been guilty of every mistake I can think of, and I surrender to the fact that there are more mistakes to be made. One of the big mistakes I have made is to fall victim to the desire to find the "holy grail"; that one system / set of indicators that I can just place on a chart and make all the confusion go away and make trading amazingly straight-forward. We've all been there - many of you reading this will still be caught up in this fantasy. And trust me, it is a fantasy... The quickest way to move forward with your trading, is to stop searching for something that doesn't exist...just pick a strategy and stick with it. Learning a strategy takes time and patience. Learning how to read the behaviour of an indicator, let alone a whole suite of them, does not happen overnight. And nor should it - nothing worth having in this life comes without a bit of persistent hard work. There are an untold number of strategies available to you, which forms part of the problem, but believe me when I tell you that most strategies will end up working if you take the time to know them intimately. I haven't even mentioned money management, which is the best way to ensure any strategy is viable over the long-term. Now I am not saying that my strategy is the only one you need to consider using...it is merely one of literally tens of thousands available to you...but if you continue hopping from one to another and not focusing yourself on learning one and ensuring your money management is correct, you will continue to walk blindly in a world of confusion. You are only delaying your success. I welcome people to post their own experiences of this, and respectfully ask that we keep this thread one of focus and personal development. It is amazing how much clarity you can finally achieve when you stop searching and start focusing. If the strategy in this thread excites you even a little, and if you can see a "way through" to earning consistent profit, then commit yourself to this for a few months. That's right - a few months. If things are not working for you for some reason and you feel the need to look elsewhere for answers, please realise that the answers are nowhere to be found on this forum or any other; the answers are to be found within you and your ability to change your behaviour.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi and thankyou for your contribution...I have used the CSS indicator many months ago whilst I was researching the whole currency strength topic. All indicators that I use repaint in some fashion, meaning that candle data is always changing whilst ever a candle is forming. Once a candle has closed, all data should remain intact. Which is why it is imperative that people base their decision to enter the market on closed candle data, never during a candles' formation. This is the reason that I find the argument of "does an indicator repaint or not" a waste of time. If you wait until candle completion, you have a clear understanding of whether you can pull the trigger based on the data available to you right then...not before. Therefore, if you are using the MTF properties of Correl8, for example an M5 with an M1, you need to wait until the close of an M5 candle before you make your decision to enter. If you use a H4 with a H1, you need to wait until the close of the H4 before you make your decision to enter. And so on. I will say that I don't enjoy people posting other indicators other than the ones I focus on for my strategy, as it only offers distraction to people when the more important task is to learn the strategy at hand and focus on making it work, but in any case I welcome you to the thread and hope you stick around. HAPPY FRIDAY ALL LET'S MAKE SOME PIPS TODAY!

Quest for perfection... We all need to make our chosen trading strategy as robust as possible, hopefully so it can be traded at will during any market session with no barrier to profit. How can we make this system more robust? It seems to work perfectly fine when the market is trending (like any good strategy should!) but the same old story happens when we are going sideways. There are signals being generated which are just plain false. And this happens even during the more volatile trading sessions. I am googling my little fingers to the bone trying to decide on one, but then thought to myself "I have a great wealth on information right at my fingertips - just ask the thread!" So...can anybody recommend a sideways indicator that actually does what it was designed to do? Because this is one area that this strategy needs improvement in. Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Welcome good sir! I miss Australia in many ways...it's nice to see people joining this thread from my home country. I used to live in Newcastle north of Sydney. Thanks for joining us here. Hope you find something of value

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Do you mean an indi that tells us when the market is ranging, so we can stay out? Or an indi that gives profitable trades in ranging markets?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I am more interested in a filter to prevent trades during ranging markets. I am also keen on not "overtrading", so any indicator which alerts me to a period of time when we shouldn't be trading is welcome.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi again...this indicator has nothing to do with my strategy or settings, but visually it looks similar to what I would like to see developed for the SS indicator. Go HERE and see what you think. Hope it does something like you are seeking until I get my act into gear with my own candle painting plans!

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi Kirkleaforex, I wrote initially about the strategy probably because this suits my personality. I need to get in the trade and get out quickly, if I leave it for long my fingers get jittery. In addition to the previous set of indicators I use one more indicator which has been essential to all my other strategies and has contributed to all of them. I trust it because it is not price derivative. When signal from a system which has an edge but is dependent on price movement is combined with an indicator which is not a price derivative and they both point to the same direction then trust me you are way ahead in this game. The other indicator which I use is volume. It gives a good indication of where the price needs to go. It has to be used in conjunction with other indicators and is a support which can enhance the win ratio of already successful system. In cases like these where the price is ranging and everyone is wondering if it is going to break the range or not. Try looking at the volume when the price hits the extremes of this range. If the volume generated is within +/-10% of the volume generated previously when price was here, then it is more likely to break this range. I have tested this and it works most of the times and there are times also when it does not work, so you need to use your personal discretion as well. And that is why I said initially it improves the edge of a system. By itself it is not a complete system. I hope this might be of help. Cheers, Ravs

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Thanks Ravs it is definitely helpful. I respect your choice not to post any indicators here but if you could make a suggestion on your preference i will make my own enquiries and do some testing. I have in the past looked at the Better Volume Indicator which i may consider again. Is this what you would suggest? Another? Thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
[quote=The other indicator which I use is volume. It gives a good indication of where the price needs to go. It has to be used in conjunction with other indicators and is a support which can enhance the win ratio of already successful system. [/quote] Have sent you a PM, Ravs.

Attached Image Hi Kirklea, could you please check this message as I guess that it should be Short exit and no Long, as Short entry before. Please advise. Thanks. Tea

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Volume Anyone? Thanks Ravs for offering to assist...it has me thinking and researching, and thinking and researching... The Better Volume indicator v1.5 (freely available on the interweb) uses a Lookback function - default is a period of 14. In the screenshot I have changed its colour to RED. It can be easily seen that when there is no volume, it dips below a certain level...(this black level line is at "50"...I added it in there as a potential crossover guide-line to delineate higher volume to low volume). Bollinger Bands are just there to illustrate the lack of volume also; tightly constricted through this session. Then there are a few spikes in volume saying "Heads Up!", and we see something is on its' way. I have overlaid a second Better Volume indi with a Lookback period of 3...I am visually testing different lookback periods as a possible overlaid chart, to see whether crossovers of these lines are possible ways to exploit changes in volume for both entry and exit signals. There were many trade signals firing off during this sideways period (you can't see them, but I have gone back and found a few), and this idea could have helped a novice trader avoid trading these periods. If this idea has any legs at all, I will check whether my programmer can code this into a modified version with the ability to choose from different periods for the crossover, plus the usual alert functionality we like to have. Thoughts anyone?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
This is true for all oscillators. The true repainting happens after a candle close and some indicators do just that (for example indicators which are trying to pick tops and bottoms). I doubt there is a scalping strategy which would work 24/5, each session (asia, europe, us) behaves differently. It's better to optimize the strategy for the time you trade. Also i doubt there is any way to filter out "ranging" behavior for scalping strategies, because on 1M scale, ranging means moving 5-7 pips up and down. And that is usually not enough to hit even your SL. The volume indicator ( i do have several of them) can be tricky, because all it does is counting the number of ticks, but often breaks happen without that simply because every other counter order (resistance/support) has been already consumed. The theory says the more you visit one price extreme the better the chances of a breakout simply because of that fact (consumed orders), thats what continuation triangles are about which are very very reliable patterns. One useful thing to use with volume indi is being able to notice the reversal. If the volume at the very extreme range is high and price refused new top/bottom its probably that (at least shortterm) reversal is in place.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Â Nice to have your wisdom with us on this thread mate.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
thanks mate, im eagerly awaiting what you will post during this weekend Anyway, right now im trying to sort of incorporate QQE into the strategy. QQe still has this huge advantage to pick up signals very early on, often before the aggressive move (which always happens VERY quickly), the trick is to filter bad ones. Looks like HA smoothed 3 is quite a powerful addition (ha smoothed 233 is basically around EMA500 MA). This is to get those 7-15 pips multiple times per day. SS is good but sometimes signals come too late or my patience is too low (which is my mental challenge always). I also use SS in higher TF to have the overall picture and direction (i use usually 30M/1H for daily direction). And im still learning to use winner, looks like it can occasionally show divergences too.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Â Hey buddy i am away for a few hours but will check it out asap and reply. Cheers.Â

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I agree with you Mades. Nice observation. Last sentence is worth many hours of research. And is really valuable advice. Has any one also considered the next two candles following a high volume candle. This might be worth a look as well.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
hi this currency correlation indicator looks interesting where can you source it. regards gordon

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Took this signal and banked 5 pips as a quick scalp.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Â Nice job! Slow and steady mate. What settings are you using for the Entry SDV value? I am trying to figure out a decent way of getting an earlier signal in combination with the change in colour on the Winner along with the change in the HA 3 period. Considering price has broken above that 233 HA smoothed and did a quick retrace, you could have your stop just below the 233HA and ride it for longer. Â But these are all considerations after the fact...it becomes a different story when the story is already written... Â Nice job though and thanks for posting your result.Â

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi Gordon, the original mq4 file is just code written by Metatrader. I have had it changed dramatically since that though...I wanted better alert functionality initially and then I became obsessed. I have chosen to withhold the mq4 files for now, for reasons I have covered here in the thread a few time over the past few days. There may well come a time when I decide to release this to the forum but for now I am trying to have people focus on learning a strategy / indicator and sticking to it rather than make the mistake of jumping from system to system. Changing the indicator too much would be counter-productive for what I am trying to achieve with this thread. I hope you spend some time here and find something of interest

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Tea, it is difficult to advise without a screenshot to see what happened. Can you take a full screen shot of the whole story please? Hopefully I will be able to help you then.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Thanks mate, just trying default settings at the beginning after I will be more familiar with this new concept. SL was just 10 pips and yes I can ride it longer with HA. Will try longer trades later....and post here some more results. Good job and thanks for this nice system.

me? why this is Kirkleas system and he shared all indies here. ad if you mean this in the middle this is for testing purposes I can share but cant see any advantage to have it.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Tea you are killing it...nice work. Takes a while to get confident with any system so in time you will trust the signals more and perhaps even find better entries, and let the winners run longer. Nice work mate...have a great weekend and we will catch up next week. Oh, and about that other matter you asked about, there is a time difference in the alerts - first alert was at 14:36hrs which is showing as a short entry, second was an exit alert at 14:51hrs which was an exit for a buy. These signals happened an hour before the signal you are showing in your picture at 15:37hrs so I am sorry but I don't understand the question you are asking. Can you break it down further for me? For me, I am not using the exit alert in the indicator anymore, and am using other exit methods. I would suggest you turn off the exit alert in the settings dialogue box and just concentrate on timing your entries, and trying to go for a minimum number of pips, say, 5 to 10, several times a day.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks. regarding this&gt;These signals happened an hour before the signal you are showing in your picture at 15:37hrs so I am sorry but I don't understand the question you are asking. Can you break it down further for me? for me now clear as didn't recognized that this exit was for previous signal. Ok going to turn off this alert now. And yes you are right that first needs to concentrate to have better entries and more trust to longer exits.. Thanks again.

@kirkleaforex First off, I'd just like to say that the strategy you've released on here is very great! You also seem like a very nice person helping out and giving tips to everyone asking questions in the thread. Thumbs up for that! Now, to the point. I have a question regarding the spread when scalping. The reason I decided to ask the following question was due to the last posts by @teapeak showcasing his quick scalps using the strategy. I'm current using a broker by the name of " Pepperstone " and at their webpage it says the following: " 0.0 Ultra Low Spread ". So I just yesterday opened up a demo account with them and made a couple of trades in a hope for low spread. That wasn't the case though. The spread is usually between 15 - 25 and usually depends on which market I'm trading with ( I trade in the currencies ). I have a feeling I'm missing something. Is the spread supposed to be that high? Or is there any way to make it lower? Now as I said earlier, I'm not experienced in this, so that might actually be a good spread. It still feels a little high though. I'd love if someone could quickly explain this to me. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Tea, Is the signal that serves as the final trigger for your most recent trades that you posted - is it the Winner crossing the 50 level? Thanks

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi, not exactly but it is the best when crossing 50 level, as you can see on upper picture I have trade which is above this level. For me as I observed today a must is all indies aligned then fire. But as I am also new to this system I need to learn more to trust to it to be able to trade longer positions and bank more pips.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hey there, welcome to the thread! Spreads have narrowed a lot over the past ten years that I have been at this. In my opinion they have never been lower. A spread of 1 to 2 pips is reasonable on the major currencies, i.e. AUDUSD / EURUSD / GBPUSD / USDCAD / USDCHF and USDJPY. With your other crosses the spreads can blow out a little more, and for exotic crosses they can be very wide, so best not to trade anything too exotic while you are starting out. I am also with Pepperstone (in Australia), but what you are referring to with a 0.0 spread is a commission based account called "RAZOR". And the spread they refer to on a Razor account is actually "from" 0.0 pips , AND with a $3.50 commission for every $100K that you trade . When they say $100K, they mean $3.50 commission per standard lot. A standard lot is calculated at $10 a pip, and with this you effectively control $100K worth of money in the market, using "leverage" (a great thing - a dangerous thing). So if you are trading using a 0.01 lot size you are spending $0.10 per pip, and it will take you 100 trades to pay out $3.50 in commission. On top of this is the spread, starting "from" 0.0. They advertise the average spread for EURUSD is 0.0 to 0.8 on a Razor account. So they offer different account structures based on what your preference is - fairly tight spread, or a very tight to zero spread PLUS commission. The minimum account opening balance on a Razor account is $200AUD. I don't believe a demo account is available on a Razor account however. And it is without a doubt the best thing in the world to hone your skills on a demo WELL before throwing live money away, even though the two aren't even closely related in terms of the emotions you will face at first. Some quick advice though...scalping the market requires focus and the ability to remain free of emotion. If you see a trade opportunity that falls within your strategy entry parameters, you need to "pull the trigger" without hesitation, and in the blink of an eye, when the market moves against you and takes out your Stop Loss, you need to shake it off and reassess without letting it get to you. This business can be extremely punishing if you don't have a huge degree of discipline. Best of luck - stick around and ask questions of people here, and of course there is plenty of help in other forums on FF. A great place to start your journey.

Very true Tea...I have found that a move up from oversold area is more like buying sentiment is entering the market, but signal is not ready...then, just like RSI, once it hits and goes past the 50 level, that seems a decent entry. And this usually coincides with other signals, which is handy. And Tea, according to what you mentioned and posted earlier, you have banked about 25 pips already today, using a new strategy. That is a great start my friend. Build on it. I would recommend changing the "MaxBarsBack" setting in the indicator settings box to 5000, just for a while over the weekend, and look back through the past few days of data to see where signals are firing. Place a vertical line over the signal and see if it coincides with other clues. It is a good way to learn the strategy better without the stress of being in a live environment. Have a great weekend ahead!

Perfect, such an amazing answer! Thank you so much!

How many monitors do you use?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Where can I find a good buy/sell order with stoploss ea?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Â Regarding your question on EAs and where to find one, this thread is about teaching a manual trading strategy, so at this stage you won't find what you are looking for here.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Just one

--- 帖子 #489 ---
That must be a big one because you entered 3 trades at the same time 17:50.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
not that big just 21" I am using alerts so easily with 1 click tool pressing the button and that's it.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
which non price-derivative indicator are you using?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Â Quick update...unable to fulfill my promise of starting new thread over the weekend due to illness / food poisoning. Â Plus I have decided the srategy is best explained through a youtube clip so i am.mad busy learning Camstudio! Â Stay tuned...not much longer. Â Regarding current strategy for this thread, i will be posting screenshots of trades taken by me this week as a way of further clarifying the strategy as i trade it. I am still to organise a new trade explorer...it is on the To Do list.Â Â Have a great week of green pips y'all! 😃

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hi there today not too much time to trade, anyway one current trade for demonstration, again 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
and one more on EURUSD 5 pips again

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Tea you are on fire! Perhaps you should take over this thread and show us all how it's done, mate! Great to have you on here and nice to have you sharing your trades with us all.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Did you change basic settings? because u can see on my screenshot https://beemapp.s3-eu-west-1.amazona...93183fb803.jpg i had also a previous alerte that was not accurate ( red line ) and it seems u did not have it, right?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Looking to sell AUDUSD if there is a sustained break down below Daily Open. Bearish price action where price is right now. Just waiting on signal from the strategy template. Looking for price to break below 0.76140 with an SS signal and Winner indi heading down. Of course this is totally against what is being seen on longer term TF's so all this could be entirely wrong...but...as anything is possible in this game, it is therefore possible we have found our top for now.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
no Kirk I am just apprentice here and still learning this system slowly and yes looks very good. trying to find best entry points and to go hurry to every trade opportunity the system alarming me. I did my homework over the weekend so entering only best looking signals to me. will keep post more trades as they will come. thanks again for your effort and nice system

--- 帖子 #499 ---
no I didn't change any settings just turned on some alarms. see pic.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Thanks a lot Tea but really strange i have received more alerts than u

--- 帖子 #501 ---
this could be caused by your broker data feed

Hi Kirk, The Strength separation indicator works fine on the majors but not so well on the cross pairs. Any idea on how to tweak it? Anyone?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hi there, yes this is true and in particular for the smaller time frames. However you will find plenty of examples where it works perfectly well for all pairs, just not as often it seems. As this indicator measures the strength of one currency against another, if you are considering any pair not involving the USD you really need something in the market that increases the volatility of that pair, e.g. news etc. That's not to say that technical analysis won't work on non-USD pairs with the SS indicator, it's just not as obvious and not as frequent. My strategy purely looks at the majors as the USD strength plays a major role in these pairs' course. For example, if you notice AUD/EUR/GBP and NZD all rising together, you can assume it is due to USD weakness. If you are interested in JPY pairs only, you need to take notice of the group strength of AUD/EUR/GBP/NZD and if these are all rising against JPY, then you can assume there is JPY weakness across the board. It is here you can exploit the differences in strength and search for signals on these non-USD pairs. Unfortunately for the SS indicator, it just can't catch the signals quite as easily for non-USD pairs as it can with USD, and requires a bit more attention to detail. But the signals are there. Try turning the USD line to visible and do some analysis...see screenshots attached of the GBPJPY pair with USD line visible and notice that when there was a separation in GBPUSD, overall GBP strength increased against the JPY also...whilst ever GBP was well above USD there was a rise in GBPJPY, and then when there was a cross back at the zero line, we see a reversal of strength against JPY and a drop in price accordingly. The cross of GBPUSD at the zero line would have been a great exit point for the BUY trade on GBPJPY. If having three currency lines is too much "spaghetti" for you, a similar way of achieving this is to have two monitors, or if you have just one available, two chart windows showing on the screen side by side, i.e. one for GBPUSD and one for GBPJPY. This way, if there is a strong signal on GBPUSD you can use that to better inform your trading decisions on GBPJPY. Takes some time and practice, but it is worth the effort especially if non-USD pairs are "your thang." Try tweaking the iPRI number also...in the example in the screenshots I am using a (34) iPRI rather than the standard (89) I normally use. The (34) seems to pick up signals better on non-USD pairs, but you will need to test this more as I don't usually trade anything but the majors. Oh, and ensure you have the same iPRI value on both charts... Hope all that helps somewhat!

--- 帖子 #504 ---
My first trade today 5 pips as usual

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Again 5 pips but this one was not ideal entry anyway in profit.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Why did u long there? I dont see any buy SS signal here, winner indi was above 85 and dropping. Whats your entrytrigger value?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi Kirk, Thank you for taking the time to reply. I did not expect such a lengthy answer and a prompt one at that. I shall work on your suggestions. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and green pips to you

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Next to the yellow line, but as I wrote not too good, I took it at the end of the trend

--- 帖子 #509 ---
This one was perfect setup and quick result.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Â The keys to any strategy (in no particular order) are: 1) patience when waiting for the market to come to you; 2) knowing and trusting your "edge" intimately so you have confidence to pull the trigger; 3) a decent exit strategy; 4) appropriate Money Management, and; 5) know when you have had enough for the day. Â Tea you seem to have it all sewn up. Nice work buddy. I hope to be able to post some of my own trade results at some stage but in the interim you are a shining light for us all here. Â 5 pips here, 5 pips there...no rush...let them come. ☺

--- 帖子 #511 ---
still don't see a thing... Anyway, interesting observation: It looks like the indi AFL winner is even better than SS for 1M pure scalping, especially when indi is at its extreme values (above 90 / below 10) and changes color. I will experimenting more with it but on some more volatile pairs (GU) it can indicate short temp reversal very soon and you can get 5-30 pip scalps (how much depending on when indi changes color again / how much was the previous move) many times over the day. It's also less dependent on type of day (ranging/trending).

--- 帖子 #512 ---
You rock ! congrats . will begin my day trading, hope also some good entries as u did

--- 帖子 #513 ---
See pic again with arrow . there is the main signal..... If you want to trade just AFLwinner indie alone, I am sure you will end in loss sooner or later, as you need more filters not just this one indie.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
This one ended in loss need to analyze more what happened.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Tea, there's always going to be losses, of course...it is the cost of doing business in the strange world that we choose to live in here! But on looking at your screen, it doesn't appear that price broker the renko upper channel, which would have been the entry signal. Think of the channel kind of similar to a fractal point...if price stays within the fractals it becomes range bound. If it breaks a fractal we look for a new high / low fractal point. Maybe just wait a bit longer for confirmation and check whether price is actually heading higher / lower after breaking the channel boundary. Cool? EDIT:...also, I notice you have your Daily Open filter switched on...if you test it being off, you would have received a nice signal for that down move as soon as price broker through the renko channel lower boundary...just a thought. These user inputs in the indicator are there to be played with. See what you reckon anyway.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I havent said just AFL. HA smoothed 3 works very nice with it. I'm not sure if you are using SL, but having a tight SL means you need to enter the market very soon that's why I'm experimenting with tools Kirkle gave us beyond his own strategy. I don't need to report my own findings here i just thought i would owe it to Kirkle who was the first and originated idea of using certain combo of indicators.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Ok I thought that only AFL. Anyway please if Kirk allows in his thread, report your findings here with some examples for benefit of others too and yes using initial SL=10 pips

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Thanks for your suggestions will analyze them deeper and will try incorporate into this system.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
nice and quick 5 pips

--- 帖子 #520 ---
[quote=Anyway please if Kirk allows in his thread, report your findings here with some examples for benefit of others too[/quote] Tea as much as I am pushing this strategy because I am confident that it can pull pips out of the market if people use it correctly, I know that people are going to test it with other indicators that they already know and trust and that is fine. I guess as long as the main focus of the thread isn't lost, which is the concept of strength / separation and an overall supportive environment for people to come and learn. I am happy with that. Oh, and nice job with the 5 pips...yet again!

--- 帖子 #521 ---
thanks for your kind and supportive words.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
another 5 pips a bit riskier as at the border of HA 233, but SS was wide open so I fire it

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Is this what you wanted to trade as scalping just with AFL an HA 3?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
quite long trade as lazy market but again 5 pips

--- 帖子 #525 ---
One trade today on trend continuation as no more time 5 pips scalp.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
5 pips a day at the right risk / leverage etc is all people need, to be honest. Get consistent with the system you are following, and then as your account grows, your lot size grows with it, and so does the reward. Nice work again mate - enjoy your time away from the screen.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Sorry thread have not had much time to contribute as I have been massively busy learning Camtasia and developing my NEW strategy into a full-blown indicator. I know, I know, I know...this is taking forever, but believe me it is worth waiting for...so please be patient and stay tuned. I will have the indicator by the weekend or early next week at the latest at which point I will be posting it straight away - no mucking around. The weekend will be spent recording a Youtube-style video explaining the system and new indicator / settings etc, so come Monday (all going well) the new thread will be live. I'm excited!

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Good luck Kirk, take your time mate. Best regards Shaun

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi Kirk Thanks for your help. I'm really curious to watch your video. Cheers. Merka

--- 帖子 #530 ---
You're a legend. Looking forward!

--- 帖子 #531 ---
back again and took 5 pips from EU

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Tea, Thank you for your posts (i find them very helpful as I am trying to build confidence in the method). Question: checkmarks (signals) in your posts are different from mine. Is it because you have changed the Entry Trigger Value in the SS 89 indicator (mine is at 55.0). Thank you.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hey MidnightRun hope you don't mind me chiming in, I think Tea has quit trading for the day. From memory Tea is using (34) as his iPRI value - test this value to see if it matches his charts. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi thread! Been killing it today with my newest strategy which I will be announcing very soon. Just wanted to jump on here and mention that I am seeing EURUSD strong upward move approaching as we at VERY strong support on higher TF's and additional indicators are suggesting upward movement to come, hopefully in this session. Anyway, that's my opinion...good trading and green pips to all.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #536 ---
First of all,thank you very much kirkleaforex for sharing with us your strategy. Second,some quick results. I saw that there is still some potential,so,I took advantage.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Another one,a little bit earlier today.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Welcome to the thread and thanks for posting your results. There was a lot of opportunity in the market yesterday - EURUSD went beserk. It is great to have you on board!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Welcome Hope you find something of value in here phantom5000

--- 帖子 #540 ---
After massive volume yesterday on EURUSD, today it has been testing possible new lows but is finding it difficult to sustain. I am feeling we have reached a bottom for now and am looking buy EURUSD as a swing trade. My new strategy suggests oversold conditions on H4 and H1, with the D1 being close to oversold. Will see what happens if price rises above Daily Open and enter above this level is price sustains a break above. In the short-term I am buying EURUSD with the Daily Open as the target - Entry 1.09027. EDIT: Stopped out at break even. Price is now testing Weekly S1 level...waiting for next signal. EDIT: Looks bearish again for now...next major support around 1.0830 and then the weekly S2 below at 1.0815. I am not tempted to enter when we are in oversold already...will sit this out until we get a clear signal of an upward move out of the O/S zone.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi Kirk, The red and blue ticks repaint. I just saw it happen on USDCAD 15m chart where a red tick appeared but now it has disappeared. Is there any way your coder can fix the issue?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
rajandas which version of the indicator are you using? The latest version was updated on the thread October 13th.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I am using the one from post 428. I could be doing something wrong. Let me monitor the indicator over a period of time just to be sure. Do I need to refresh the indicator to get the latest alerts? Thank you sir

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi mate, no the indicator shouldn't need to be refreshed, and I have not had an instance of repainting and I use it every day. I am not saying it didn't happen to you, but it could just be an anomaly. One the candle prints fully any signals that appear should remain there forever. If you change the TF and change it back sometimes this can affect whether they stay on the screen, and perhaps there is something that needs to be examined here if this is happening to lots of people. It's kind of related to the issue where lots of arrows suddenly appear on the screen when you load up a new chart, but opening the settings and pressing "ok" resets everything. Please continue with what you are doing and let me know if there are any further instances of this and if so I will take it up with the programmer. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Today just 1 trade as just came in banked 5 pips

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Quick 5 pips from the morning, nice setup.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hey Kirk, Do change the indicator width to 2 since you wouldn't share the file, it doesn't look smart. Good job.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hey Chito sorry for the delay in getting back to you mate. Here is a version with the thinner lines you requested. This one also has the Daily Open filter but I have removed the exit alert as I really find this to be useless. If you use it successfully I will add it back in for you, but for now I will leave it out. All the best and thanks for being part of the thread.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Ai, Regards.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
You can do it for future by yourself in indicator settings see pic.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
While this is true, Tea, you might find that if you change the time frame everything reverts to whatever is written in the code. Try it on your platform and see, but this is what happens on mine.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Yea confirming it is hard-coded , so changing back when TF is changed. Thanks for notifying me as I am not changing TF for this system

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hello Kirk Do you roughly know when your new thread will be live? Thanks. Merka

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hi Merka, just waiting on a final version of a new indicator which will embody everything I am trying to do manually with the strategy. Have been promised this tomorrow sometime. And then I just have to record the Camtasia vid...which doesn't sit comfortably let me tell you! I am not into this kind of thing (I hate the sound of my own voice when I hear it played back!) but I do feel it is the best way of sharing and explaining, so I will give it a go. I am going to say Thursday at this stage. Sorry I know it keeps getting delayed and put back...but we are nearly there I promise!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Thanks and don't worry about your voce. I don't like my voce too.

Today,during Carney's speech there have been a lot of opportunities.I've killed like only 20 pips just because I was a little bit afraid of the GBP movement,considering that the speech wasn't so "powerful". Keep up !

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hey Kirk, how did you go with the new indicator? Again thank you for your scalping strategy!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Still in progress! Aaaarrrrgggghhhhhhh....!!! Programmer will finish today, he says... I have recorded my strategy introductory video and am now just waiting on him to finish the indi, then I can upload everything and post the new thread. We are SO CLOSE!!

A quick update for subscribers of this thread. First of all, I wanted to say that I really appreciate the private messages I have been receiving offering support and thanks for what I am trying to achieve. It is nice to see the show of support I have out there among you. Secondly, thanks to my subscribers who have stayed the course and to those that have been contributing. If the current strategy offers you green pips, then that is wonderful and I am glad to have offered something that has been beneficial to you. An update for those who are waiting patiently for me to outline my new strategy. I received my latest indicator and discovered it needed tweaking so I have requested changes, and have been promised that these will be finalised over the weekend. Then I can start my forward-testing. This will not affect my ability to start posting my new video series, which I have already started recording. The first video will be up on Youtube over the weekend. And a link to my new thread will be commencing over the coming days also. As this is so close to being all set up and operational, I have decided to release the .mq4 files for the "Strength Separation" indicator, which I have been getting many requests for. I hope that this gesture will inspire further development of the indicator and allow users to get more out of it. This decision has not come lightly, as I have poured countless hours and a lot of $$$ into its' development. Additionally, I have always felt that some level of control over people's access to it was required so that users could stop "seeking" something better and just focus in on playing with basic settings and getting to know the indicator really well. I now feel that my "protectionist" attitude has gone far enough as I can see people are getting consistent results. I therefore invite everybody, programmers and users alike, to assist in its' ongoing development. Now is your turn to get involved and help make this really shine. As such, here is the original .mq4 file for you to download. Go nuts...

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I cant seem to download the RAR file.. anyway you can just post indicator so i can drag to my MT4? THANKS!!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Here you are mate... Note I do not have access to the .mq4 files for the Daily Open line or the RenkoStreet Channel indicators. And you can download the Strength Separation indis from the previous post above if you haven't already. Cheers.

any updates on your new system?

Hi, Kirk is working hard behind the scenes putting everything together. I am sure he will have an update soon and I am sure it will be worth the wait. Best regards Shaun

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thanks Shaun, yes you are right...almost... I have been very busy heading to Burma to have my Visa extended for another 60 days, AND I have been very busy trying to get this indicate developed in between everything else. I have been promised I will have it tonight, so...whatever that means, lol. If nothing eventuates as promised, as I am beginning to become used to, then I will begin uploading my strategy / videos without it.Tired of everything being on hold...

--- 帖子 #547 ---
The stresses of moving countries and the council and government politics I know only too well my friend. I am sure you will get there. A local in Spain once told me, 'if you think something will get done in say 1 day, then double it here, then double it again, and then double it again. That way you will not be disappointed because you will be fed up waiting.' He was not wrong lol!!! Keep the faith, Best regards Shaun

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks to share this strategy. May I have other version of this indi correl8b.ex4 ? It dose not have option to show more back information of chart. In H1 just shows 8 days. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hi there...I have asked my programmer to remove some code from the existing indicator, and then I will re-post the new version, which will offer no exit strategy and then all those annoying green crosses won't appear on the screen. When I post this version, all you have to do is change the number of bars to whatever you like ("MaxBarsBack" setting) and it will fix your problem. I hope to have that ready in the coming day or so. I am still waiting on my newest indicator for my new strategy to be finished, but have been told that I will have it today.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Longer time not to post... anyway still 5 pips quick scalp.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Awesome Tea...I hope that the time you were away not posting doesn't mean you were not getting these great results! lol Keep it up mate.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Thanks, was a bit busy so no time to post, anyway your system is very good and stable so thanks again for this.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hello thread, time for an update. First my apologies for dropping the ball with this thread of late. I have been working feverishly getting my new strategy off the ground, which is almost complete. There were some bugs in my logic which made the new indicator produce some odd signals and a few subsequent losses early on, so it was back to the drawing board to tighten everything up. The result is nothing short of fantastic. So, with that in mind, the new indicator is being coded and will take approximately one more week to finalise - guaranteed! I have been working on a Youtube video series and have even set up my own Youtube channel so people can view stuff there and subscribe to it if they choose. My plan is to provide regular live trade video examples to the new thread so people can see how I trade the strategy live, from noticing an initial setup to placing and managing the trade. When the time comes I will let everyone know the new thread details where you will find all indicators, (including mq4 files), templates and so on. Regarding this current thread, I will be honest enough to admit I have lost some interest and am no longer trading this system, as my newest strategy is producing some stellar results, far better than what I was achieving with the SS Strategy. I will ensure I remain available for questions about the SS / Correl8 as there is no doubt it remains a profitable strategy when traded properly (like ANY strategy!) So stay tuned my little thread-lings! We are fast approaching the release date - Saturday 26 November.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Woohoo, looking forward. Thank you for sharing with us!

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Good work Mate. when the going gets tough.......... the tough must get going. stay save .........

Hi kirk I can't find your YouTube channel. Could you please post the link to it. Thanks. Merka

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hi Merka...until everything is ready for release the channel is set to private. I will post details of everything on release date November 26. Thanks for your continued interest.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
read the whole thread tonight , looks great, I was excited to see correl8 and renkostreet together, I might dissapoint and delight you the renkostreet channel is super signals modded or basicly a form of HI's and Lows however I love it :-) If I'm wrong just ignore me Pho.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Â Hey there and welcome! Â Nothing is ever a disappointment Photize, i am here to learn as much as i am here to share. I will try out the super signal channel and compare. Thanks for your input

--- 帖子 #590 ---
It was a long wait hehe, almost 26 november

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hey there...I will be starting the new thread as promised, but without the indicator unfortunately. Once again I am let down by my programmer...as good as he is at programming, he is not good with deadlines. This time I was adamant I needed it ready by yesterday, which he agreed to, and here we are...he is not answering my Skype messages. So I will be posting the strategy along with a few screenshots of what he indicator will look like as it displays the alert setups, however I cannot promise the indicator until I know something more concrete. Expect an update later today with the new thread details.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
thank you kirkleaforex, we can wait with patient. and thank you for the sharing

--- 帖子 #593 ---
My new thread is up and running. It can be found HERE: I will be drip-feeding the information over several days, because there is too much to share in just one post. Once the information is fully posted, I will include the indicators, template etc for download. Thanks to everyone on this thread who has shown their interest and support in this new project. I hope it offers you something of value. Cheers and green pips to all! Kirk

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi Kirkleaforex, I actually got here backwards...starting at your MultiStochs thread. I've gone thru that thread and like others, awaiting the final outcome of that. In the meantime I am really appreciating the work you've done here. I actually placed my first 2 trades on the 15M charts while at lunch this afternoon after going thru this strategy; very straightforward approach; they were both winners. I hope to execute more as the days go by and also wait for the MultiStoch thread; that one is also straightforward (well, at least to me).

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hello,first of all Thanks for your System.I"m testing this system on Demo M15 TF and please,if you have some advice about settings indicators or something else,Entry ,Exit,SL,non Usd pairs,..something that can help me with trading.I read eary all posts and I think thats great system.If somebody trade on M15,it wil be great to change experiences. Thanks once again Kirkleaforex,you are a great guy!!!!!!!! Alex

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Hi Alex, welcome to the thread! Firstly, well done for testing first on a demo. Many people grow impatient with these things and jump into a live environment before they fully understand everything. I think your patience will serve you well! Next, setup and entry settings are discretionary, i.e. different people will have different settings that they believe work best for them. What I offer here is merely a suggestion. What I have been trialling however is an iPRI period of 34 along with an EntryTriggerValue of ZERO. Essentially this means that as soon as a candle has closed and a crossover has occurred, a signal is generated. This can be quite powerful, as you will see in the attached screen-shot. I am referring to the sell signals where price is bouncing off the DR1 Pivot Point. Obviously I would be ignoring a BUY signal when price is just below a major Pivot, as this is an unnecessarily risky entry, and we should wait to see whether price bounces or breaks through beforehand. In these SELL instances however, they were risk-free, had no draw-down, and the target (next lower PP line) was found pretty quickly. See how this looks on your chart and test it out. Let me know what you think!

Hallo Kirkleaforex,sorry I am Late,it"s a Happy December.First of all,Iam very appreciate for your system,your unselfishness and hard working to develope,testing and so on.Thanks.I am working with system 7 days and results are positive,every day if Iam not directly with system"s rules,I used a Martingale,very rare. (whats your opinion) I like this system,because,its permit to me only 1 trade per pair,maybe reenter ,second entry in LO and thats it(with big help two ind.- Hama 233 and Hama3.-)I see that in your pictue is Bollinger (I think to confirm entry and direction with correl8),instead a renko stuff.ok.Is Bollinger better,than a Renko on TF15.Iused a correl 8 on H1,to confirm direction,I feel much beter,comfortable(if you don"t mind),but maybe to add Bollinger is beter(I know that too much indicator is nothing)You know,that combinations in chees,and it have only 64 fields and combinations are more than the stars on the sky and the forex have more combinations than all galacyes and all stars on those galacyes,hehe. Sooooooo,in every chart in every systems,I have a following ind.(daily open,weekly pivot(posible reverse-look Davit"s(he is a great guy, too) threat, Pivot trading with TDI , Ind. previous day High/Low.(Tms-Likica on TF30)and arround numbers.Whats your opinion,maybe daily pivot and instead Renko,S/R? OK,I am working with 7 Usd pairs(like you in this system)) and gold and what"s your opinion about risk because there is no diversations on the others pairs ,or Iam wrong?(how many trades per day and pairs,average,you have?The non-Usd pairs setting on correl8 is no available,goverment,CIA secret or somethin else.OK. I report on this threat my weekly trading results(after 11 th January,when I starting) and polish system to unconscious.Thats it,for now.AND Happy New Year and Happy Christmas to all in this thread(I am to be afraid,thats only us are here-OK-it"s more space.....Once again Thanks and Salute!!!!!p.s.I add my trading picture pp.ss.I love Foster"s beer Alexander

And Picture

Hello Alex and welcome to the thread. I am glad you are enjoying it and getting results. That is a lot of questions so I will try and answer them one by one. I think the first question is in relation to Martingale strategy - I will say that I have never tried this so I cannot offer an opinion. Next you asked whether renko is better than Bollinger, but again I can only disappoint you as I have never used Renko, so I cannot answer this either. I have read that Renko is very good at providing S/R so this could be useful for you to try out. For me however, I am fond of pivots and the daily open. What I will say is that Bollinger Bands are useful in determining the volatility of a move, and because this system is based on volatility, Bollinger Bands fit in quite nicely. I have another S/R indicator that was recently sent to me from a friend and I will post that here so you can try it out. You can add every time frame or just select individual ones that you want. I am a scalper and so I use the M15, M30, H1 and H4 as my S/R and I enter off the M1 and M5. I think you will like the indicator Your decision to look at multiple time frames is a good idea. H1 for direction for an M15 entry is good. Regarding non-USD pairs, there will be signals so if you have a favourite non-USD pair that you like to trade, try it out. The signals may not occur as frequently but they do happen, so perhaps set it up so that it alerts you on mobile phone / email and that way you don't have to sit around and wait. I don't know for sure, but I am thinking that perhaps it would be a news event that would offer more trading opportunities with non-USD pairs, as the daily volatility just isn't there like it is with USD pairs. I don't trade non-USD pairs as the spreads are wider and I don't like giving my hard-earned money away for nothing...give me tight spreads and I am happy! How many trades / pairs etc? I can't answer this as it all depends on the day - it may be a busy day with lots of high impact news announcements or it may be very quiet. Also, I don't trade every day and I don't like trading more than one pair at a time...I do this because it gives me the focus I need to stay in control and not become confused and distracted. Another factor is that you and I have different trading styles, i.e. you trade longer time frames, and I am a scalper. Recently I have been trading around 10 to 15 trades a day; in and out quick, maybe 8 to 10 pips each trade. But only on a single pair like I said. I don't think you could manage 10 trades a day from the M15 unless you were trading multiple pairs...and this would lead to fatigue! As a final point, try and play around with the iCorrel8 and WINNER settings. I have used everything from a 13 period, a 34 period, a 55 period and an 89. I find a 34 works really well for earlier entries, but the 89 will help keep you in a trade when there is a trend so you don't exit too early. Try and experiment and come up with your own strategy that works best for your own trading style. Back-test each setting and see which looks like it might work well going forward. (But always trade on DEMO if you are forward-testing!) Anyway I think that has answered you fairly well. I am thankful for your input here and I wish you the best of luck with your trading when you resume next year. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and to all your family and friends! EDIT: added S/R files as mentioned.

Hi guys I have followed this discussion and I want to introduce my strategy. I developed it on a spreadsheet, and I would like to someone improve it on metatrader, to have real time signals. The algo is simple: 1) Calculate the log of price 2) Calculate the strength of a currency in the following way: e.g. usd_strenght= 1/eurusd+usdchf+ 1/audusd +....... and so on for all pairs. role: when the x_strenght is at the numerator in the currency do the inverse, otherwise add it normally. 3) Compute the "correlation" between the time series strenght obtained in the previous step, e.g.: Corr(usd_strengh;eur_strength) 4) Trading role: sell/buy when a) the x_strenght is negative correlated (below a threshold) and b) we have a strong vs weak currency.

Hey Alex1055 , congratulations for your profit Can You tell more how you use it? Regards

Thanks for the awesome indicator

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Greeting, Hi I'm just asking.Could somebody here make correlation indi for common 28 pair Fx ?and from 28 pair we can decide what pair we can select for viewing. let say : Time frame H1 Time 0000 PAIR : EURUSD,EURJPY,USDJPY from time 0000 this indi will calculate pips movement for this 3 pair until 0100..then continues timing on open candle base on time frame.Counting start from open candle n stop at close candle. Same concept base on overlay chart but I want indi same like at this thread but no formula.Just counting movement pips base on close or open candle only.Correlation pair base on pips movement only.No need formula to calculate strength individual currency thanks

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi Kirk, I just found your wonderful thread. I am going to check the nice system. Thank you very much for your hard work. Congratulations. Salim

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi Salim, you are very welcome. As you have probably seen, I am not around anymore - life gets in the way of what we would rather be doing sometimes, and this has been the case for me unfortunately. But I am glad to sign on here today and read your comment. I hope that this strategy continues to serve you well. I am still working on a different version of this indicator (a BIG improvement!), which I am hopeful will be something worthy of releasing as a gift to my subscribers in the coming months after full testing is complete. Until then though, thanks again for your comment and trade well. Kirk.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
In my eyes the strategy where U get the most pips/trade on my fav TFs H1 and H4...The long term strat is simple and clearly described...what more? yes....a shot from my calculations...

--- 帖子 #616 ---
This is the result without filtering the entrys with QQE: More pips

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Possible improvements from my sight: - Break-Even after 3 candles if order is 30 points in profit - Only double trading I ll have a look on it the next days...

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hi guys. There's another multi indi strat. This ones seems really good too

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Yes...but others like shapran from the MOT Thread(which is really good) remove details even when the thread hasn t really started! Or the "Trading the GAP with Xl so no one can understand how we do it" thread...:-) This is transparent, clear and there are not 2 indicator added after 10 replies... In my eyes a jewel....like Xmas...

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Wnere can I get this signal..Thank you. see attached image

--- 帖子 #621 ---
This is 3 years hard coding oop testing framework where I can test in seconds where others with 99% percent data needs years...

--- 帖子 #622 ---
As per the PDF document, you should first seek signal from the Correl8 indicator and then the QQE indicator. Do you perhaps have more backtest results on the major pairs?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
do you have low self esteem? I ask this because you act like one of those people that likes to pat themselves in the back. And you should know something very important about trading in general. Its not who writes an EA or indicator that is important(I can hire any shmo to do that) Its the success of the strategy.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
esteem, pat, shmo....I tried the google translate.....without success! Some people don t understand I m only here to code good EAs...nothing more... ok...to make it more understandable: Some people don t understand I m only here to code good EAs...nothing more... ok...to make it much more understandable(and I hope for everyone here): Some people don t understand I m only here to code good EAs...nothing more... Sorry...I thought this my thread...

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Wow this escalated quite quickly. Lets keep it clean everyone like the initial thread creator intended it to be. Everyone has an important role to play. Reteid2222, I'm very glad if you are here to help with coding. Can you perhaps help me with testing a few ideas? It takes to long doing it manually. How can I contact you directly?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Please don't take that man serious. he is on every thread claiming he is a good coder but never does anything and of he ever codes its a mediocre piece of code. he is just a troll

--- 帖子 #627 ---
i was just posting this. i hope this clown can be blocked because he sounds like a 12 year old. very irritating in everything he posts and never truly tries to contribute or help. Always seeking attention and nothing else

--- 帖子 #628 ---
ohhh...just keep cool....nothings to escalate here....just call the girls who clean the thread 4 me...

--- 帖子 #629 ---
I take these guys this way.....

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Question. Why were you banned from http://www.tradingsystemforex.com???...??????????????

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Can you help me with coding to backtest a strategy?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
The problem is...what is help? I have not time for coding next year...4 days university and the the 3 days coding/testing/implementing/uploading/debugging/....(200 aspects hidden :-) ) my actual projects....

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I m not really convinced of entries and exists...look here:

--- 帖子 #634 ---
What is your timeframe on chart and what is your timeframe on the indicator? Can you use 4h TF on indicator? Do you then have to wait every 4 hours for the indicator to draw or can it repaint within the 4 hours? Example of entry and exit on gold using 4h indicator and 1 day indicator:

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi Kirkleaforex, I'm your happy subscriber Could you update info about a different version of this indicator please? Thanks. Kind regards!

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Hi I am not up to date with all this yet, can you please explain how do I get a different tf indicator on a screen eg. 4h screen and want a 1h qqe indicator on? Thanks

--- 帖子 #637 ---
.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Is this system creating any profits in gold? Looks interesting!

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I'm interested in this also... Would like to have access to some TE on the trusted broker, to see the potential profitability over different market conditions.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
hy reteidd can you add option alert cross push or message for correl8C?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Sorry...this is very old and I have tested the EA without success...these mtf indicators look good on paper but they do calculation in the future...

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hello reteid2222, I don't know about Mot system. Can you explain it? What is number indicator line? Thank you very much!

--- 帖子 #451 ---
This system was deleted by the author..sorry...

--- 帖子 #452 ---
You still "here" by any chance? You were active like 6months ago, but I hope you will receive notification and rejoin with the update... I believe some epic trading weeks (3) ahead, so would like to see all system activated on it so that we can see in retrospect which might be "it"

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi Reteind so you made a robot of this strategy and didn't work?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I try to add notification for this correl8 indicator so when the pairs crosses will give notification to your device. Something wrong that the file can not attach to the chart, please someone look for the right code for this indicator ? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
I started reading this thread from the beginning and it took me two days to complete. Now, where is everybody?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hello, Can someone explain me why i have horizontal line in Gold, Aud and Cad? I have read that it is dependend from "suffix" but i can not solve this problem. I would like to know what i should change in code.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
The iCorrel indicator sends alerts for exits also...since it's now redundant, is there a way it can be removed so it doesn't distract from the main purpose of waiting for the arrow signals? Anyone in 2020 still alive...??? Say YEAH!!!

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Many thanks Kirk for this so good thread, a long time after you created this . I begin to use now this nice strategy with very nice results Thanks to you and also to all people of this thread to help not good traders like me to get some results... Be careful

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hello, can anyone here provide the metatrader 5 version of this indicator? Correl8.mq5 The source code if possible. An excellent project, I hope they continue.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
hi can somebody create a EA based on this Indicator ? Thanks in Advance

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Which?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi, Where can we download this Indicator please ?
