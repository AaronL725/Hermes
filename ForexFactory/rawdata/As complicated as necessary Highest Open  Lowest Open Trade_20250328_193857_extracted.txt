Warning for new readers: The developed EA is based on Currency Strength within one day and send reverse orders when extreme values of the strengths are achieved. It is a similar procedure as described by @TooSlow but now has nothing in common. Sory, but from idleness I have not opened a new thread for. Here I have made this announcement http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...97#post9014297 Please always download and use the latest EA version. Last EA version " smCSReverse EA_v3.3.6 " in post #773 - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post9467481 ################################################################################ @TooSlow has posted in recent times an interesting system " Highest Open / Lowest Open Trade " : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=590623 . My trouble is that I understand difficult but as compensation forget quickly, so I need a few indicators to understand and better apply the system. Here is a first indicator version to drawn the Opens, Highs and Lows lines, and I tried to make it more similar to @TooSlow indicator. (A similar idea may be found here: http://www.forex-central.net/rat-rev...g-strategy.php ) Attached File(s) smAverageTrueRange.mq4 3 KB | 2,887 downloads Attached File(s) smHiLoOpen Lines_v1.2.mq4 11 KB | 3,399 downloads | Uploaded Jun 2, 2016 5:56pm Attached Image (click to enlarge) ################################################################################ The last version for the High-Low-Open EA " smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3.2 "

Hi SwingMan Joine smHiLoOpen Lines_v1.0 I dont want to show the price box, how to closed it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I can make a change today evening.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for the indicator. The "H1 - open" however, should mark the highes t or lowes t H1 open of any moment of the day, not the opens inbetween - at least that's my understanding.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
That's my understanding as well SwingMan. Thank you for coding the indicator.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
@Go5 and @pip-boss , both of you are right! The Open of the last H1 candle was intended only for me, and I wanted to program later "the highest or lowest H1 open of any moment of the day". Now I do that just for you...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Here a new Version smHiLoOpenLines_v1.1 (See #Post 1) From the 50 downloaders until now has no one posted here charts or comments, and in @TooSlow's thread a single post. I believe that it makes no more sense to post additional indicators if they are not applied for the system and are downloaded only in indicator collections. .

. {image}[/quote give it little time my friend . and thankx ]

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi SwingMan, thanks for the indicator. It makes everything easier to figure out. I agree with HighFivve, give it little time.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Complicated? Maybe it is your humor. Didn't know you visited my thread. You are welcome to post there.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks a lot SwingMan. There is a little bug: the H1 highes/lowest open lines change with the timeframe: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Here a new Version smHiLoOpenLines_v1.2 (See #Post 1) You are right! Please check this version.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Now it's fine, thanks once again!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi Swing man, please keep up your great work! But unfortunately FF becomes just a place where people collect indicators in hope to find the grail for free. Nobody is interested in new ideas or thinking outside the box or develop something based on 6000 chart hours observation. All about uge Ego`s .

Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #16 ---
LOL, where the heck did you pull out that video ? But it `s true, it is all about the numbers

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Isn't that movie required viewing by all traders?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
It may be, but I think that for me it is a little bit more complicated than necessary... I would suggest also to consider "The Quarters Theory" from Ilian Yotov: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=567962 then we have an unbeatable trading system.

A combination of HOLO and Currency Strength in the first version of smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.0 Until I post it in the @TooSlow's thread, please test this first version. There are certainly many bugs and it will be corrected in the next versions. Have fun.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Here the new version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.1 with few changes.

Here the new version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.2 with corrections of a few bugs.

swinman sir this is really complicated and nice EA.I have a request sir,I am looking for simple sma/ema dashboard which shows multi pair (not at a time options to choose pair no)10,20,50,10,200(period/ma)changeable price above/bellow and how far /near from ema /sma..looking forward.thanks

--- 帖子 #25 ---
SwingMan, I am following along on TooSlow's thread. Nice work on the indicator and dashboard... very much appreciated. I have been playing around with the dashboard and have a couple of questions and a request. When the pairs turn lime green what is that in reference to? And also what is the criteria for the buy and sell buttons to light up? That's very cool that the buy and sell buttons will put in a pending order at the open price. Was wondering how difficult it would be to be able to have an option to add a stoploss a certain number of pips away from the open price in the pending order? Edit: Ok... it looks like the lime green pairs is related to the spread... depending on what you have it set at... if the the spread is within the limits of your maximum allowed spread the pairs turn green. Correct me if I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Here the new version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.4 . @tradertron - You are right, the LimeGreen pairs are (default) related with the Spread&lt;30 and the ADX&gt;20 . Features in the new version 1.4: - Choice between " only Market Orders " and " Market and Pending Orders " - Pips for StopLoss and TakeProfit (for 5 decimals prices) - Nice feature: the first click on a pair name generate a container chart, and for other clicks the corresponding pair is loaded. It's more comfortable than purely to drag and drop the pairs. (The container chart gets to be identified with the comment "Dashboard chart: xxxyyy"). You can give as parameter the template with which you work and it is applied.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Great work as always SwingMan! Can you tell me why I'm getting these errors with pending orders? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I dont know why you have a H1 time frame in the message... The EA works only for M15 time frames.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Here the new version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.5 - Automatic SL and TP based on ATR * factor - Alerts on / off in order Sending As an encore, an EA of 28 charts generated and changes of the time frames. It may help if you have not all historical data.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks very much for the help! Does it play sound when the signal appears?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thanks SwingMan... much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Excellent job, SwingMan! Thanks! Would you consider using an automatic pending order option (True/False) in the EA? (Eliminating the "human factor" would allow to explore what this strategy is REALLY capable of.)

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Sure, in one of the next versions.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Sure, in one of the next versions. BUT only if I see at least 100 ( and at least 10 of you ) succesful manual trades with this EA posted here in thread. Unfortunately I have no time for it, I must program ..

--- 帖子 #36 ---
That's not a problem, I can post them. But only the successful ones...? Here are the first 3 (there were more but I was not at my VPS all day and initially I have messed up the TP/SL settings): AUDJPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZDJPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Do you have alert to the indicator. Popup alert with sound which notifiy to enter then I can enter in broker platform . I am binary option trader. So if that facility available that will be help ful.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Here the new version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.7 - Alerts for Signals on new bars - Pending orders - Distance to entry for pending orders - Expiration time for pending orders

--- 帖子 #39 ---
good work do they

--- 帖子 #40 ---
What is wrong ? http://prntscr.com/bgzwaf http://prntscr.com/bgzwj6 All pairs are in market watch and there is no option to put suffix or prefix for a pair. No errors printed either.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Most UK traders will use brokers offfering spread betting so that profits are tax free. Typically we will need to insert a suffix such as "SB".

--- 帖子 #42 ---
The little problem are not the pairs but the currencies in the strength analyses. In the strength table e.g. for EURCADm I must have EUR and CAD and not EUR and CADm. You are right and I try to solve this.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Please test the new version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.8 with prefix and sufix for the pairs (the last parameters in Input), and tell me if it works. See # Post 53

--- 帖子 #44 ---
As alternative to the smStrengthRange09 indicator, here an indicator ( smStrengthClusterMom_v3.1 ) who calculate the momentum of a moving average.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
what is the purpose of the strenght indicator with dashboard signal? what we should look for in strength indicator before taking the trade?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
That fixed the issue. Thank you. The trading board does nothing tho. If signal for sell on a pair (or buy) and you press sell it does not open trade on any of the 4 types of order open, no errors printed and adjusted lot size. 7000 deposit orders 0.1 (broker accepts from 0.01) so that is not the issue. Any ideeas ? Would like to test and contribute back to this system.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
What indicators gives in DashBoard is my idea, and what you can you with strengths, you must read himself in forum here (example is Robinho's thread)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Tell me please a Broker with sufixes for testing. I have not the time to search for.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
exness

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Is OK, I have found the cause and later can I post the correction. Will you have the pair names from the broker, or only the default names? In this case I think the buttons must be larger... You have also a little problem, because the broker hase not NZDCHFm, only NZDCHF.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
One pair missing is not an issue. I can delete it from watch unless it will mess up the logic that defines the strenght of a pair. European brokers usually have prefix or suffix and i guess many others will have been asking for this fix. Thanks for the hard work.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I will be posting London results daily after London closes. today a late start (opened acc on broker with no suffix) http://prntscr.com/bh6ftw 4 winner 0 loser and ignore the one highlighted in blue as i pressed gu 2 times by mistake and closed manual.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Please test the corrected prefix/suffix version: smHiLO DashBoard EA_v1.8.1 Attention in pairs without suffix (like NZDCHF), they must be registered separately. Tell me if it works now.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
im testing smHiLO v1.8 working just find with XM broker but the box for the currency pair smaller e.g :AUDUSDmicro for smHiLo v1.8.1 the sufix dont work. i dont know why. i using the same setting for the v1.8

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Will test 1.8.1 and continue to post from the other account. London session open and waiting for trades opportunity. Thank you

--- 帖子 #56 ---
All is working! - In version 1.8.1 we have in the pair list the standard names and the EA take automaticaly the sufix for calculations. - I opened a real account but because is not validated (depot is zero) is not possible to send orders. Generaly all functions are OK. The calculated indicators and the signals are identical e.g. with Pepperstone Broker.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Very nice from you! - The signals with the HighestOpen / LowestOpen are for countertrend trading and for Strength values outside of the limits e.g. 7.0/3.0. Try also for trend phases following: - You have the smStrengthRange09_v2.4 indicator. The colored circles indicate the divergence of the strength slope of the pairs. If both strengths are between limits (7.0/3.0) and we have a colored circle, wait 1-2 minutes and if the circle do not disappear, take a scalp trade in the trend direction. The rule can be from 00-levels (5 pips TP, 10 pips SL). Trend direction gives the SMMA(34) with bars above or below the MA. If you can confirm that this work, we can take the idea for signals in the EA.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
http://prntscr.com/bhg518 Cad chf does not take tp/sl . I canceled the trade 3 times and open fresh one (in a spam of a min) to see if a one time error or just does not take tp/sl. Also adjusted for today sl to 2.5 atr and tp to 1.5 after getting invalid stops earlier on multiple pairs where broker's minimum tp or sl was too tight.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Spread is too high....

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Closed last trade for today and results. 6 win 2 loss I can look at that Swingman and will contact in Pm but once i have 100 trades with this so i can focus on one thing at a time. Will pm you when this is done and will keep posting daily trades. So far in 2 days i had 10 win and 2 loss which is good but more trades are needee to have a clear view .

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Very good initiative! As the only member which tested the Dashboard, just you get next week the version 2.1 with the automatically or manually trading of the slopes (described in #Post 57). I still have to program some things and just today there are still live prices for testing. The divergences of the slopes are now displayed in the trend column.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
worked well with pair suffix ...thank you SwingMan

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Nice! Just two questions: - Do you use fix SL/TP or ATR*factors? - I see in the EA-Comments two texts: Hilo and DBHilo . In program I found only DBHilo and dont know why you have also Hilo . In principle there is no problem...

Testing Dashboard: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Swingman, I was testing you dashboard with binary option 30 min expiry. Following my result and observation. 1. I got 17-4 result in last two days. Moment I am getting signal I am taking the trade for 30 min. Sometime price going against me then coming back to my direction . 2. I observe after getting the reversal signal from dashboard then if I wait for divergence signal from strength indicator(RED or Green dot) that gives more strong signal. 3. In post 57 concept is absolutely killer. With divergence if we combine strengths are between limits (7.0/3.0) and we have a colored circle, wait 1-2 minutes and if the circle do not disappear, take a scalp trade in the trend direction. This will work very well. But I dot think 34 ema required for it. ADX can determine the trend also. Is your version 2.1 giving additional alert for divergence with slope strength combination with trend confirmation? If not if you put an alert when divergence dot appear with combination of trend strength indicator at 7.0/3.0 level and its above ema 34 that will work get. Infact it will work like robinho system.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Check this GBPNZD vertical line. Call trader. In binary option 15 min call trade will work very well. But singal should come moment divergence dot comes with satisfied with other criteria. If we wait for candle close then that will be too later. Price is already moved long distance. Hope this can be incorporated as signal and alert in dashboard.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Is interesting how you can use the tool for Binary! ( OK, you and also @Matraguna get the version 2.1 ). Yesterday I could shortly test for circles the waiting time until a trading signal. 5 minutes are too many, and perhaps 1-2 minutes are sufficient. The circles are drawn when divergences appears. Signals there is only after fullfiled conditions for Spread, ADX, MA(34). We need the MA(34) trend condition because we have two directions: trend and counter trend signals. Here the ADX indicator smADX Histogram which I use.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
1. I Just change lot 0.01 and prefix : m. Other setting is standart. 2. Sorry, Hilo is from other EA. *My Suggestion: When i attached EA, EA suddenly make Pending Order for EU. When i looked EU chart is 6 hour ago touched high daily yesterday. This PO is useless i guess. Solution: when attach new EA, maybe wait for new touch high. Thanks

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Good remark! The problem is that the platform need some time to update prices for the 28 pairs. I will install a wait time until signal getting.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Swingman, Thanks for response. Can you incorporate following things in expert. 1.Divergence signal with filter Spread, ADX, MA(34).Can you also include the filter for strength indicator (70/30) also? In case of trend signal. 2.Also can you please provide two option on expert indicator. One divergence alert after candle close when all criteria met. Second one dot wait for candle close moment divergence met with other indicator it will alert. This will help enter early. 3.Also you can put input parameter for ADX, Moving average that will help to change the input parameter and test with different ADX and moving average values.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
- The filter are programmed - Have you not seen???? You have the input parameters for ADX, MA, ATR. - Other signals, alerts etc. no at the time.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Swingman, I am using version 1.7. But for reversal signal what is application of ADX,MA and Strength indicator? For reversal signal how this indicator used for giving signal alert can you just let me know? Yes I have seen they are inbuilt as input parameter. I think ADX ,MA and trend strength indicator more useful for trend trade. Like Robinho strategy. So I was asking is EA will be giving manual alert when divergence comes with ADX,MA,trend stregth criteria met? I was doing binary option . That is why timing was very important. That is why asking to keep option alert as and when divergence comes with all criteria met irrespective of candle close. Also its ok if you put delay for 1-2 minute before giving signal alert after divergence comes. Is Version 2.1 this divergence alert built in?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
The signals for divergences exist. We must test next week because on weekend this is not possible. In the Trend column we have circles for divergences and if the strengths are between 7.0/3.0 we have arrows. When we have arrows, should also come alerts. Next week we can check it.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
hi swingman very nice thread im kinda new in this thread and i tested your dashboard and have few questions are we supposed to take every signal trade ??

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I develop only a tool, for strategies see #Post 1 and read some other threads about currency strengths.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
rSo it will give popup alert I guess right? In trend beside divergence I can see two arrow.for example GBPCAD after trend arrow i think arrow green up arrow is divergence with trend strength.after that red circle down arrow what that arrow for? Is this reversal signal arrow?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
In principle yes. I must also check if the arrow signals are OK... The difference is = 3.0 on GBPCAD.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Swingman, We need to have clear set of rule when reversal signal alert will be given and trend signal alert will be given. As I understand from discussion this are rules are following. Let me know whether I am correct or not. Reversal Signal alert: 1. TOSLOW reversal criteria met. 2. Trend Strength currency pair difference is 3. Trend Trading signal alert criteria: 1 Price above 34 EMA. 2. Trend strength (7.0/3.0). 3. Divergence in trend strength.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Is correct, and additionally: - Spread &lt;30 (or 20, or 10 depending on the broker) - ADX&gt; 20 to prevent sideways movements

--- 帖子 #80 ---
congrats for 500 indicator sir it is really great!..what about me / may i have one more please? say price cross chart 1 hour 50sma from below and up 10 pips so dashboard column will show 1h above 50sma/ema(period changeable options) and pips 10+ so at a glance i can visualize potential trade opposite -10 .any questions and comments are most welcome.thanks.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Sory, but this is an other system and I have not even finished this...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
many many thanks for response ,no problem sir.if you just consider it then it will be great for me.looking forward.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I think if we get too slow strategy signal alert and Robinho strategy signal alert that's enough for trading. If this 2 can be incorporated this ea wI'll be pretty awsome

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Swingman, May i ask : alert email for this EA ? This EA will on VPS, so we will get email when this EA is alert. Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I would welcome the possibility to enter a list of pairs that will be excluded from the monitoring.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Agree, I know in some EAs where is a general line in "F7" the user can put in the pairs he/she would like to use for trading.i

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Here is the new version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.1 I think there are still some small bugs in it and it is still installing some functions. Who has time please test this version.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Swingman, Using with both types in auto trade, two details that I'm noticing in v2.1: - scalp trade messages (with alert_trading_signals and alert_sendorder_confirmation both false) - Close buttons stay with color after trade closed I'll continue to test and post soon! Edit: after a few trades it stopped opening trades for a some hours, had to remove from chart and put again.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
im tryin this now. keep getting "CLOSE all active and pending trades ?" message, keeps poppin out. is this normal ?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
my test car mode 4 position without stoppages but had to reboot PC expert log any errors

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Late posting as i had a full day. Today's results are 6 loss and 2 win. Total trades 14 win and 10 loss so far with this system.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I think we need a spread filter for auto trades.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Late NY session result in auto mode 1st one is scalp 2nd one is high low reversal

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Please take care that the EA is not finished. With your comments it is corrected until the functionality is stable and when it's done we can make additions and test parameters. We must have something patience.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Under Volatility_Parameters you have MaximumAllowed_Spread

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thanks very much

--- 帖子 #97 ---
attached a screenshot on my vps. anyone having the same problem? keeps getting this message every second. only occurs when autotrade is enabled. and it lags the chart window.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
It can not work at Swissquote. Some pairs have 5 (3) decimal places and other 4 (2) decimal places.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Your Loss is greather as Auto_Maximum_DailyLoss Change the limit. In the next version the EA close automatically all orders - this was a bug...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
that makes sense.. thanks!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
All is functioning, I just tested on SQ. Maybe have you not the historical data for all 28 pairs. Here a help EA to generate 28 charts on many TFs. Is not functioning for pairs with sufix... Also version 2.2

--- 帖子 #102 ---
It does not work properly. For example, it monitors the EURNZD, which actually has 90 spread, not the 9.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Please, is there a way not to have this alarms? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I think you must set " SCALP_Trading_Allowed=false "

--- 帖子 #105 ---
This can I check in the evening.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thanks Swingman, but I want to test the Scalp trading function, I just don't want constant sound and popups. For sure you can change this...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Why not? They are so nice... But, have you tried to set the parameters SoundAlert_SendOrder and Alert_SendOrderConfirmation on false?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Sure, and Alerts_Trading_Signals too, but to no avail...

--- 帖子 #109 ---
http://prntscr.com/bj6ljy 3 win 1 loss today and have EG open still but no time to post later the result for that one so tomorrow I am working on my system also in the same time so may have missed one two alerts during the day.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
In the next version 2.3, there are the parameter Alerts_SCALPING_Signals just for you. Please notify whether is better now ...

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Testing with default settings (that TP is half of SL) Scalp mode, I had 49 wins and 41 losses: Attached File(s) smHiLo Dash Scalp.xlsx 19 KB | 447 downloads Still early days but maybe inverting the strategy (switching buy and sell) would be a good idea... And thank you for the future Alerts_SCALPING_Signals !

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Here the new version - smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3 - with some bug corrections - For the click on the "Close All" Button we get now the confirmation to close only active or also pending orders - @kilion has now a parameter to disable the Alerts for Scalping signals, please test. Remark: I decided to separate the program in two EAs, one for countertrend and one for trend (scalping) trading. I think so is better to analyse the results and to trade with two different strategies.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
EG was a win last night and these are the trades i took. http://prntscr.com/bjgsqd New day started and 2 pending orders waiting right now. I see we are making progress with new ea's and will test them also once i have some decent tests on this method. Thank you SwingMan.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Wow, SwingMan, what a wonderful EA, great job !

--- 帖子 #115 ---
habe diesen Fehler

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hello SwingMan. I have download and using the last days the smStrengthRange09_v2.4 indicator and I am very satisfied, because it is the only currency strength meter which is using properly the correct formula on a line indicator chart window, all other strength indicators in this forum are using moving average lines and decimal calculations. My problem is that I can't have sound alerts when a certain maximum/minimum level threshold is reached. I am a very busy guy and if you could add sound alerts the I would be very thankful.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Maybe in the next time. I'm busier than you because I also still has to program!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
The error I saw yesterday, but after a restart of the EA has not come and I could not find the cause. I try further to find the bug.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
The solution is in the Post 85.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Is OK, but is the easiest solution and not for all users!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
http://prntscr.com/bjl9rw Short day today and many orders didn't trigger. Holliday here in Estonia tomorrow so i'm taking the rest of the week off.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Perhaps it is difficult to distinguish the spread 0.00009 and 0.0009. For example. It is not necessary for the test.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I don't manage it very well with coding I have tried first to add an alert from an article from MQL4 community, but nothing and also the indicator should have problem with it's arrays - I get this on the tester, array out of range in 'smStrengthRange09_v2.4.mq4' (442,37) and when I try to make a signal on a drag and drop program where I create and other experts and indicators the buffers seem useless. I hope you can find some time and fix it.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Swingman Why is it saying that EURCAD is disabled? I have not disabled it manually.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I dont know, but check if the Live Trading is allowed.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Yea, Live trading was allowed. If you'll see in the pic, NZDCAD trade was active. Thanks Suvopam

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Swingman: 1st of all let me tell that you're one of the best programmers at FF and your willingness to listen to others sets you apart. 2st, thank you for the option to disable Scalp alarms / messages. It worked perfectly. I was testing (just) Scalp system and with important conclusions. Testing was done with fixed and equal TP and SL: Attached Image In 10 hours there are 74 losers and 37 winners. Exactly 2 negatives for 1 positive. Attached File(s) scalp 10 hours test.xlsx 25 KB | 364 downloads That allows 2 conclusions: 1 - the system (strategy) that the EA is based is a failure (or it's wrongly implemented on the EA). 2 - we have a great opportunity! We need a INVERT input to switch Buy and Sell. It'll not give double winners vs losers because of spreads , but for sure we need to test it! Swingman, please do your magic and include that option in next version (and don't do changes to the system core)!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Swingman is an excellent programmer. The strategy is a failure not his ea. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #129 ---
- I know... - I'm not so sure... Here the current results from a user: 55 trades with 55 wins... OK, maybe dont remain so, but is not bad. - I believe that the scalper strategy is not the best!

Dear Swingman, would your scalping strategy built-in pullback before confirming to trigger the entry ? I find in FF certain people is using WPR as a pullback as a benchmark. Let say if the user is using your EA M30 as a TF, M30 shows a sell signal, the pullback to be confirmed at two lower TF like M5 when it crosses OUT from the OB (below the -20 line), only then your EA to trigger the short entry. Thanks

Sory, but this is an other system and I have not finished the current EA and have not separated the two strategies (countertrend and trend) what I wanted to do.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Opps, I'm sorry for not respecting the rules of HiLo.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Reporting results of Scalp test after 32 hours: 229 losers, 121 winners (settings at previous post). Attached File(s) detail.xlsx 48 KB | 385 downloads Confirms again that an INVERT is called for. Swingman, if you want to continue development and tune Scalp strategy, please do a separate special version of present EA with invert, so that we can test it. One bug, as you can confirm in Excel file above there was a trade without SL or TP: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I analysed the pairs' results based on their behaviours, only 4 pairs out of 26 pairs are giving profits in overall. Means majority "may" need Invert and the remaining 4 pairs may require as it is. Of course, sample size must be big enough to analyse again.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Market is about psychology and I believe each pair should have its own "fans or followers" to be closely participating, and therefore the prices direction and behaviour shall move according to the participants' strategies and motives behind. One standard of strategy / rule to apply all the 28 currency pairs may not be so appropriate. I used to do analysis. After this UK-EU voting poll, the price movements shall come back to the normal from next Monday opening onward. Whoever has bigger sample sizes of demo trades, I can help to do analysis for the benefits of everybody.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi Swingman, I was just testing scalping strategy which you developed. I think signal is not getting filtered with currency strength. When signal comes both currency in the pair should be top 3 or bottom 3 currency in the table. For example check the following trade AUDCHF. AUD is top 3 currency table and arrow is up. CHF is bottom 3 currency table and arrow is down. I took 15 minute binary option trade and won. This will increase the accuracy I guess. If you add this additional filter in scalping trade. With placement of the currency arrow is also very important in this case which direction its showing. Filter should be added both Arrow and Placement of the currency.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I supose you have not long used the tool and currency strengths. Please read in other threads in the forum because not only the position is important as Robinho recommends in his thread. In the section " Currency_Strength " you have parameters for HiLo limits and the difference. When a currency exceed a limit and the difference is large, then there is a reverse signal and the buttons BUY or CALL enabled. The circles in the indicator show divergences on and for values between the HiLo limits you can take trend trades . You've traded correctly because a divergence was present and the two currencies were over and below the 5.0 line. I think if you activate the Scalping module you get signals for your trade, please test. I have developed only a tool and everyone can use it how they want.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Swingman, I abosolutely underdstand your point. I am trading scalping trade as per Robinho rule. when I took the trade I make sure in currency strength both currency top 3 and bottom 3. Also check ADR values in up side is green. Then only I took the buy trade. What I am asking incorporate this strength as additional filter signal. Then when signal comes then we check the ADR if its more that today ADR range then we can take the reversal or dot take any trade. If its within ADR then take trend trade. Hope I am clarify myself. I think this will be more accurate scalping signal. I was traded the signal by activating that scalping signal. But I think signal missing the strength filter as I mentioned.

4 Losses and 2 wins today on london session and this takes me back to initial balance having no gains or losses.

2-0 reversal trade. Late Newyork. If you are taking trend scalping trade check robinho rule. Take the trade accordingly. Do not just blindly take the trade.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
i am not. if you read last few pages you'd see what method i use for trading

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Just an idea: W%R13, RSI13, HA indicators. The opposite trend (as Swingman). Entry later according to indicators. Output at the next SR.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi Swingman, For scalping trade why robinho rule is not incorporated giving signal for trade? That wil increase the efficiency. 1. Divergence. 2. Currency strength currency top 3 and bottom three in strength table. As shown in AUDCHF example. 3. Check trend indicator all green. M5,M15,H1,H4,D1. 4. Check ADR up is green if taking up trade. If ADR down is green if taking down trade. 5. Ofcaurse price is above 34 EMA. As this is already incorporated in the EA. Then give signal alert to tade.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hello Swingman, The dashboard is great. I've been testing the EA and I can say that it can benefit from an option like 'do not buy: GBP, CHF etc.' to exclude the EA from trading counter-trend moves in more volatile times... Just my two cents... Thanks, Regards.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
You are right, and here is a version with this option and more... I have removed the trend/scalping module. Because nobody post here results means for me that my programming work is superfluous... In any case with the version 1.7 can be reached daily hit ratios between 95% and 100% ... For further explanations on the EA and ask of newbis I have not got time in the next period because the EA is still at work and is not ready yet.

Many thanks for your work. Trading will be easier.

As usual all my trading is fully automatic - although I think it is worth to intervene manually in some critical situations from time to time .... Attached is the setfile I use - it's very close to OOTB. Attached File(s) smCSReserve EA_v1.7.doc 26 KB | 760 downloads

Hmm thx ! Yes you are right - GP (Global Prime is GMT + 3 ... so I have to add 3 hours to SM's OOTB numbers ?) Right ?

Hi DerBerliner: I see you use :Auto_TradingHours_London=07:15-11:45 but for CET london time is 09:15-13: 45 Regards crebcreb

--- 帖子 #157 ---
To not have such discutions about market trading hours, the EA considered the GMT hours. You can find in Web such tables:

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I'm trade on the Berlin time (summer time + 3 hour GMT) setting 06:15 GMT = 9:15 Berlin time (summer time) = 15 minutes after London open setting: Delete all Pendings: 17:00 GMT = 20:00 Berlin time (summer time)

Hi Ghostbiker; Could do you explain please litte more about do you use, "2 chart in one account"? do you mean do you use only two pairs( two charts) or twice pairs for all the 28 pairs? I really appreciate your reply thank you

Here the new version - smCSReverse EA_v1.8 - with some bug corrections. Please replace the version 1.7 In #Post 151 you find some settings which are used by @ghostbiker. If they test other settings please tell us the results...

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Please from the start of this thread which is completely different from the original Highest Open / Lowest Open system in the other thread, I haven't understand exactly how it is working. You are posting here new dashboards EA's, but without an image example tutorial which I think it is appropriate for all of us who have subscribed to learn.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Respected Sir, Its an honor to see your contribution in this group for the present and the next generation. Very very few people work this way despite health concerns. Thanking you Regards Scalperpeak

--- 帖子 #163 ---
You are absolutely right to miss explanations to the EA and dashboard... I deliver only one or more tools and everybody can use this. About lines you find explanations in @TooSlow thread, about CurrencyStrength in many other threads or recently in @Robinhos thread. At the time is the system not very much similar to the HiLo-Opens system, is much more complex. If you does not understand the system, please not apply because it can turn into losses. Use to learn at least as much time how I needed for development...

--- 帖子 #164 ---
@crebcreb: - I use the complete EA smCSReverse, in this Brexit time without GBP Pairs, NZDCHF, NZDCAD (GBP pairs go grazy) - I use one Chart EA with 19 pairs with Stop orders - I use one Chart EA with 19 pairs with Limit Orders - in one account the 2 Charts with different Magicnumbers and different Lots - I use the strength over 8.0 and under 2.0 and the difference over 6.0 because I work and trade with the strength since 2009 I'm a expert of strength trading for many years

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Where is this more complex system explained? Are the rules listed? Thank you? P.S. why make it complex?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I'll try to catch up with the system, if there are rules and without rules I am blind. It would be a nice move, if you make a new dashboard using only currency strength for entries and another option using only the difference between two currencies.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
the Dashboard to understand is easy and not heavy. This EA is complex, but I mean rentable - you can trade with HiOpen and LoOpen - you can trade with strength hi and low and the difference - you can trade MarketOrders manually - you can trade full auto with stoporders and limitorders - you can trade with SL and TP what you like - you can trade the SL and TP automated with ATR - you can trade the pairs you want or you like - you must read only the settings - you must only begin and test it on a demo account or trade this EA not

Here the new version - smCSReverse EA_v1.9 - with a small addition: for clarity, in the last row is also the type of Order-Sending (Stop-, Limit-Order, etc.), and the MagicNumber. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Who wants can replace the version 1.8

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hello. To trade in Auto the CsReverse, how can I set it the EA to trade .01 lots ONLY? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
@trustyct: - you can trade if you like - my tipp: 0.01 per 1000 capital -test first by Demo account-

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I just see that if we have StopOrder and LimitOrder, the EA can send simultaneously two Pending Orders because there are two different MagicNumbers. Is this OK or should we allow only a Pending Order?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thank you ghostbiker about the details, I haven't download the dashboard for its complexity, but I started using strength last year and I see some good results. Glad to exchange ideas about currency strength and what strategies and techniques we use. A question about 8.0 2.0 and 6.0 difference, you jump in a trade when you see this set-up, or you wait for a retracement, can you show me an example, AUD is strong today.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
@Js3mwtRc: - you must look the currencies different - Example manually trading: I will see different the - AUD 8.5 and higher and the other part 1.2 and lower difference 7.1 and higher - USD 8.2 - 1.5 - EUR 8.2 - 1.5 - GBP 9.0 - 0.1 (because BREXIT) - JPY 8.5 - 1.2 - CHF 8.7 - 1.0 - CAD 8.7 - 0.9 - NZD 8.8 - 0.8 @SwingMan: - with one PendingOrder is enough (Limit or Stop) - nice the pendings are modify now, come a signal for this :-)

Hi Guys Today LO market its going very slow and NY will open soon, we will see what happen

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Not much activity in NY because of 4th of july.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Yes Mantraguna and Tobyb80 Sorry for that,I forgot today is 4 July and bank holliday in USA

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thanks for the effort. Here is the bug that I've found: (v 1.9) If the EA ( x1 stop orders, x1 limit orders) opens 2 trades in one pair it doesn't add them up. // (does not add the - trade with the + trade) check pictures.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
@ openyoureyes: - yes open your eyes and read the thread, you must make 2 Charts one for stoporders one for limitorders with the 1.9 not in one Chart - it is not a bug

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I don't know what you are implying but: they are on 2 seperate charts, I didn't put it on picture. they share the same magic number, so the calculation should add (-) and (+).

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I trade with 2 Charts and 2 different Magicnumbers - one Chart only for stoporders example magicnumber 1000 - one Chart only for limitorders example magicnumber 1500 and for the limitorder you can make the distance greater 30 / 40 / 50 Pips (300 / 400 / 500) and all is well and easy

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Please use two charts with two different Magic Numbers and test further! You might be using two Magics, because: 12.94 - 11.58 = 1.36 and 8.96 - 8.32 = 0.64; 3.98 - 3.26 = 0.72; and 0.72 + 0.64 = 1.36 In the loop to get a win/loss, we have one pair and one MN to get this. If they are other trades with the same MN this is ignored. (Possible explanation for your comment).

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Wouldn't it be simplier to use different demos resp. MT4-platforms for each trading method ? Doing so we can see the differences between the methods at a glance. I'm personally running 3 platforms with the v1.8. See here Post #152: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=593119&amp;page=8

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Not everybody has four computers for different platforms like you, or a laptop with enough memory... As example I have only a slow computer with Windows XP...

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I have - one Account - 2 Charts, one for stoporders one for limitorders - 2 different magicnumbers - 2 different Lots 0.15 for limitorders, 0.12 Lots for stoporders, so I can see in the history the difference I will trade in the future live both Orders too in one account 30.06. and 01.07. - 39 Orders closed total 100% winrate - 24 stoporders closed TP 20 - 15 Limitorders closed TP 25 - 30

--- 帖子 #189 ---
@SwingMan: Hmmm .... 3 MT4-platforms aren't to much, every computer, even any slower device can do the Job without probs, your EA don't demand much capacity. @GB: Can't imagine, that you got these results without any manual interventions. Again here, like in FF.de: "green, green, green" ? Why the hell ? Who needs this nonsens ? So I'm waiting results of other testers here in this thread - plz, plz without tomfool yelling ! P.S.: It's absolutely OK if you get good results interfering manually - the point is: this different trading style must be admitted.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hey traders, I have problem and i wanted to share with you.I would like to give an example. EA gave sell signal but normally must be buy. U think, is this bug? http://prnt.sc/bonfe0

--- 帖子 #191 ---
@Berliner: yeah you must learn trading not gambling, I trade since 15 years with FX and have developed self many EA's and you? Why you hav`nt green Pips? Trading ist learning learning learning, test, test, test and trading trading trading. If you have many red Pips you are on the false site. The green Pips come not from the sky, come from your own brain, not from the others brain and not from the printer And you must read the thread, I have tell that this trades from the EA not manually. I have 2 charts for EA, not 3 (the thirth for manually) I trade manually too with Renko boxes and special chart Tradertykhev with strength and have green Pips @natla: this are strength orders (Retracement) not normal orders. The high strength sell the lower strength buy. If you want normal orders then the EA ist not so good for you. Highest open and lowest open are retracement orders too, are not trendy orders

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thank you. I'm trying to trade only .01 lots but keep getting alerts asking me to press "OK" if I want to indeed trade below the .10 lots? Sorry to be a bother but not sure why I'm having difficulty trading as small as .01. I currently have RiscPerTrade at 0.0 and Number of Lots at .01 and then the alerts keep popping to either press "ok" to trade below .10 or no trade would take place without my pressing the "ok" alert button. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
The EA name is "Reverse" and in an up trend the signals are sell signals.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
@ GB Damn ! So your results have nothing to do with SwingMans EA posted here ? That's what I suppose ! But here in this thread the aim is testing of the instruments SM coded for us - a misty description of your trading isn't helpful.

@DerBerliner: can you look in my Server? If not then you tell us here not false informations. I work only with the smCSReverse 1.0 up to 1.9 not with others . If you don't understand trading and not understand the smCSReverse is not my or our problem. And please bring not the problems from the FF.DE to here. The thread destroyer and the lover of red Pips are from FF.DE Antonov can you learn sure if you can make DD 95% and many red Pips us gift .-) Ja MANDL der Antonov macht das gerne fr 1500 Ocken jhrlich, da bekommt wenigsten Dive davon einen dicken Batzen ab... so ist allen geholfen, du hast die roten Pips die du so liebst und 95% DD hast du dann auch die du sicher gesucht hast, Antonov hat deine Ocken. Aber rote Pips findest du eher im FF.DE als hier.

AUD +20 pips this morning using only smStrength indicator. The difference was over 6.0 and AUD currency was very strong, so exactly at 9:00 Europe (2 hours ahead of London) bought it. Don't forget to look for correlation on weekly smStrength - 7.0 is good. You are using pending orders and buy/sell above high and lows and what are the take profit and stop loss, for manual trading?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
- for manually trading and stoporders (distance 20 Pips) TP 20 - 30 Pips SL 200 Pips (can close in minutes or in 1 - 2 days) - example AUDUSD 8.5 - 1.5 sell (difference 7.0) -retrace trade-

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi Ghostbiker, For your example AUD 8.5 and NZD supporse 0.8 and you are getting 7.8 difference. That means if you get a AUDNZD sell signal in dashboard. You will take the sell right? Let me know if my understanding is correct or not.

- Please learn to use the posting rules: when you quote my question and you ask an other question , I dont know what you want from me. - If you compare old with new programs or versions, is your problem. I wrote several times that bugs been corrected. I use everytime only the last version and you must understand what is new, what is changed, what must you do. You have here an EA that is not finished and I expect help from tester because I can not test everything (I have to write the program)... If you do not testing is no problem, perhaps after a year you can find the finished EA in the thread.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
@Bedayan: yes this is right and absolutely correct - the higher currency AUD 8.5 the lower currency NZD 0.8 is AUDNZD sell -difference 7.7 have a good weight- - both currencies have the potential for a retracement AUD down NZD up - you must look one day a "currency meter" and look for the strength of the 8 currencies walking up and down up and down and so on - don't trade 07:30 pm GMT and 11:45 pm GMT because the strength is'nt correct in this time

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I wrote it incomprehensible. I wrote about the shortcomings detected during testing. Reports (buy / sell) are reversed. Alerts do not conform to the old version. Does not apply to automated trading. I apologise.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I don't trade counter trade, but this post is really helpful. What is the winning rate, do you trade for many time this strategy? I like to know. Also you take the swing high/low after the close of the bar and add a stop order or from the price the difference happens? Sorry for the too much questions and thank you very much for the answers.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
- if I trade manually this strategy with very strength settings, the win rate is 95% - 100% - now here I let run only automated trading - all orders reversed orders - yesterday closed nothing - today closed the following for now Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hy, just to better understand your trading style. the inputs of your currency strength you posted already. So if I understood correctly, you have 2 charts with either EA on with one limit order and the other stop order. Am I right? Thx. D.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Looks good, I suppose you choose the high/low to count the stop order distance where your trade will trigger. I banked 16 pips at GBPUSD using your system manual and now I have an order at EURGBP with 20 pips target, lets see

--- 帖子 #209 ---
@DirkH143: - yes 2 Chart on one account for automated trading, yes you can trade this manually too with 2 charts - I trade not GBP pairs after the BREXIT , I will wait a while - distance for stoporders 20 Pips (200)

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Very nice, and many thanks for your support! Here the new version - smCSReverse EA_v2.2 - with 110% win rate . Who is not reaching your own fault, not the EA! 1. I removed the trading option " HighestLowestOpen_StopOrders " because according to the comments of @ghostbiker it is not necessary. In brackets we have the required differences to send automatically a trading order. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. In the EA comments we got the TP/SL values and very important, the strength values at the moment of order sending! Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3. The limits are given for the individual currencies as recommended by @ghostbiker (many, many thanks, because this is a year-long experience!). Sure you have from time to time to adapt they to the market. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi Swingman, I am testing it in binary option so placing trade manually. So in point no 1 you have mentioned "1. In brackets we have the required differences to send automatically a trading order." Is this included in manual signal alert also? I mean to say if required difference is met then manual signal alert will be given?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
hi SwingMan thank u thank u thank u i am testing Ea and i will send its resualt but for the firs my dashboard texes are not recogizable in picture it is showed

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I wrote that at the time this is only for automation. The differences are not included for signal alerts. I analyse later the code and try to make changes for you. But, who are your results? The EA has a function and erases the hard drive if you do not post results here!

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Today I got result 8-14. During Frankfurt opening and London opening I took the trade. I took the trade moment the signal alert given. I take 30 min expiry in binary option. Lot of time I see when I take the trade price goes against me. For example today just before london open I took GBPJPY Call signal arert from dashboard. But price keep on going the down and I lost it. It seems strength difference is answer to this problem. If you incorporate this strength difference in signal alert then I guess reversal trades can be taken correct time and price wont go against my trade that much. Also I can input different values of strength and check which optimize the reversal trade for different pair. I am using it only manual trading only.

For the zero error, open the expert and scroll at the bottom where you will add the suffix or prefix that you need. You have an @ after each pair and it's not recognizable by the expert unless you add it. The skull may mean that you are outside the trading timeframe described in the Ea's settings. Correct me if i'm wrong swingman.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I've started testing the new version. Some insight &amp; requests: - average strength diff column (depending on stop/limit expiry time, good for manual trading I guess -maybe too resource consuming-) - exclude pairs (more direct than strength diff. / check screenshot from another EA) The EA needs volatility and high ATR like others. Today was ~+%5-10 on better days I've seen ~+%80

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I and the EA are not a fortune teller to know in advance whether a pair is to buy or to sell...

--- 帖子 #225 ---
- hehe we look in the Crystal come buy or sell and entry and exit and all is well

--- 帖子 #226 ---
well, I suggest the same: user should put the input. example: DontBuyCurrencies: GBP,CHF DontSellCurrencies: CHF DontBuyPairs: DontSellPairs: AUDNZD, AUDCAD, NZDCAD, GBPCAD I think you get the idea now... So the EA will never buy GBP / GBP pairs, so if there is a flash sell no SL will be hit because there won't be a position... (also trading GBP/x is ~always more expensive -pip value- than trading USD/x and therefore for more aggressive strategies, I don't use GBP. -to make use of more margin/leverage-) "limiting counter-trend moves", trying to reduce drawdown.

- don't trade currency is easy, give in 9.1 and -0.1 then will not trade this currency example GBP or by JPY or or.. or you can delete the pairs you will not trade in the settings in the Dashboard - don't trade buy or sell is easy the same 9.1 = trade not sell -0.01 is not trade buy - trading is thinking with brain first thinking and after writing

--- 帖子 #228 ---
actually it is not the same. think of it as clusters; if you do it that way you can't trade some crosses. think more. and think first, write later?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
- I need this not I want to help you - why is not the same? have u test it? Sure no ! - I can trade with the EA 1.9 and 2.2 and all is well and I can trade only sell and only buy if I want and I can trade without different currencies - we want a small and easy EA with easy settings and not a EA with 25 Indis and 10 skripts and not one can trade with it like other dashboards and systems

Thank You SwingMan Hi GB, 1. Can you share your 2 set file ? Limit &amp; stop. 2. How big the DD ? I know your result is plus, trader must count DD also. Big DD is not for real account. Thanks

--- 帖子 #231 ---
- you can trade first one month with 0.01 Lot and with the win go higher with the lot - with 0.01 Lot you have only a little DD / what is a big DD ? - I begin with a new EA live with lower lots and trade after one month only with the win, not with the capital - I trade with this EA live if the EA is more finished, not on the begin of developement - I must fine tuning the settings for the new update 2.2 from tomorrow on, the settings have changed - more information tomorrow evening to the same time to the update 2.2

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Gostbiker, why do I get an alert when placing auto .01 lot trades and only trades when I press "okay button"? Alerts me that lot is below .10 and if I'm okay with that.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
@trustyct: make you manually orders? In the settings down "Alert_SendOrderConfirmation" give in "false" ?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Or share the templates.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
- StopLimits are too large for your capital. Decrease the risc of 0.5% or - Set Enable_MoneyManagement=false If you yourself do not know such things, please do not use EAs and trade only manually. In the next version 2.3 I introduced only for you the parameter: Accept_MinimumLots_ForSmallCapital=true to no more get the alert and to have to think about it...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Here the new version - smCSReverse EA_v2.3 Only small changes: - parameter: Accept_MinimumLots_ForSmallCapital= true Attached Image - in the alerts are writen also the strengths and the difference Attached Image

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thanks I will put it on test.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I agree with ghostbiker, we need an EA using only currency strength and nothing else. Example when EUR reach a certain threshold like 8.0 &gt; buy, or sell for a reverse option. The EA should not buy/sell like, only basket trades, but and individual pairs. Also a weekly and monthly strength option would be the best, did you look what happened after weekly smStrength indicator showed 9.0 JPY and 0.0 GBP? It gave more than 400 pips!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Big DD is not only talking about big-small LOT. Big Floating MINUS before get PLUS ,is Big DD also. This is what i want to know from experience "plus trader" like you.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
- oh no no no we need not the strength in the past, we need only the strength for now or for the future !! the strength change often within minutes or hours, not in weeks or months - what is a big floating ? What is a big DD ? How much % from capital ? - you don't trade 0.1 Lot with 1K - you can make the settings very strong, then come lower orders and lower DD - GBP is dangerous for strength trading since BREXIT, I wait better

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Sure can you have a " Big Floating DD ", why we should trade small lots with small risk and this is easy to calculate or to give in MoneyManagement a risc of 0.1% for example.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
My test From yesterday to now

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Just to add after loading new template. Till now did not get any signal from EA. It seems extreme option are very few and signal will be accurate.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Already reported this problem before (and wasn't just me): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Maybe are you right, but can you prove this to us? This is an other system, perhaps an EndOfDay system, also you must use an other Strength calculation method, maybe Momentum or MA-slope. Later I want to make something like this. The Reverse-EA calculate the Strength as position of the Close between daily High/Low. At 12:00 hour we have as example 48 M15 bars. For daily Strengths we have in a month only 22 bars. Here is an indicator for such cases, you can test it. For daily charts the Strength calculation is made with the monthly High/Low, for H1/H4 with the weekly High/Low, and for M5/M30 with the daily High/Low.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
You can always trade the retraces, and use a stop loss for all extreme situations even after Brexit - $0.10 for $1.000 is very good. Of-course, if you don't want more than 20-30% of draw-down, you can avoid Brexit days, or mass shootings, like this on U.S. with 50 dead.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
It seems that you are using an older version. If this happens even in the latest version?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Sorry, but the EA could not provide the big crash in GBPJPY! (I quote @ghostbiker: I talk again: don't trade GBP pairs, this is dangerous since BREXIT !! ) What screen resolution do you have? With me with 1680x1050 looks better.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I talk again: don't trade GBP pairs, this is dangerous since BREXIT !! If you trade GBP pairs is your own problem, not the problem of the EA

--- 帖子 #251 ---
No, I believe that using the strength only 2 hours after the London open you can have good results, but you should have a good strategy and this is out of the subject. I am not interesting so much on reverse trades now, but I will follow this thread and the tools you provide for the philosophy, buy/sell the high/lows with supply and demand. Thank you.

Sorry I was not "talking" about the reverse EA

my resolution is 1920*1080 but i try any resolution my computer have no one did not work i think it is because of my fonts in windows an other question why Ea signal is very often and from yesterday to now just 2 signal

@mahmood: today the difference is to small, I have only to now 2 Orders open and closed too the move is to small today and the strength not high over 8.0 and not low under 1.8 you must have patience

boring day. EA request: move SL to BE after 1/2 TP (pipwise) is reached. (for profit locking)

--- 帖子 #259 ---
today my orders closed Attached Image (click to enlarge) BE is a bad function, most or all orders go in BE not in TP, better is only 50% TP is the same @DirkH143: I trade for 1% Risk maximal per trade, it is normal 1K trading with 0.01 Lot and + 30 Pips = 3.00 $ = 0.3% x 3 orders, then you have more then from the bankster in one year

--- 帖子 #260 ---
For me it is the same as ghostbiker. All three went in plus and closed. You just have to wait. (Set it and Forget it.) The DD was actually pretty high. I would say up to 100 pips. But with a 0.01 lot, not big deal. So far testing anyway and no real trading account. D.

Here the new version - smCSReverse EA_v2.4 Only small changes. In the alerts for Order sending are also writen the currency strengths and the difference. Warning: the first (6) members who downloaded the EA_v2.4, please replace it. I just corrected the win/loss calculation because I forgot to substract the Comission and the Swap. Check if the figures are now identical with the platform. Sory

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hy SwingMan, Would it be possible for the EA to record the trades it is in, in terms of how far it goes into minus? I know you have a stop loss, but if the stop loss is, lets say 200 pips, it takes a while before triggering. Most of the trades end up as a win and if you don't sit infront of the screen, you don't know how far it went into minus before reversing and close with a plus. If that would be possible, then I might have another idea on how to shave of some more pips. Thx D.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Please not now What you mean is the MAE (Maximum Adverse Excursion) analysis. This can you do only when a program is functioning and is tested. Do this and tell us eventually problems, then we'll see.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
DirkH143: TP 20 up to 30 Pips is enough per Order. I think with trading of 15 years experience FX, the BE and trailing give not more Pips the trading will be more difficult and the end is lower Pips

--- 帖子 #269 ---
@ swingman: It was just a thought. Then lets keep on testing. @ ghostbiker: I know what you mean. Keep it simple. But when things work out good, you start thinking on how to improve things further. It's human nature, I guess. Just have to contain the urge to try to fix everything and make it perfect. D.

Hi guys system is interesting but is there any rule with wich we can seperate trades with highest propabilities vs versa? Im talking about using EA in manual mode. Thanc you.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
SwingMan: Can you please add automatic Closed ALL in $ amount . Like: "basket take profit". Example only: input= 20 ($ , not pips). Rules=If total order amount is $20 = closed all order open. Do not close pending order. Because: IF we use small pip for SL or TP, that cannot modify on big spread pair like GJ,GA,EG, ets. So the order is running without SL &amp; TP. Thank OPENING ASIA Attached Image (click to enlarge) This EA is counter trend. So avoid Strong trend Pair.

Kalawe, which broker are you using that is so active? I'm using 3 different brokers and none of them had more than 1 closed positions in the past 24 hours. Thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
note this is not the broker, this are the settings. The difference is small and for a long term dangerous - Look in the comments CHFJPY 1.9 - 6.0 is not good or 7.9 - 3.6 it is luck that the orders closed - and a small profit of 8 - 12 pips

Hy, here are my results. I actually just started on Wednesday with testing. 31 trades and all in plus. Some took longer than others. D. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Dirk, did you manipulate the EA's settings to get so many entries or running latest EA update as is?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
by which EA version ?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
It is still the V.2.2 of that EA. I took the settings from ghostbiker but adjusted that times so that he trades from 15 minutes before Tokyo opening until 2 hours before New York closing. During those 3 days I did not do anything to the EA. Fully automated runthrough. No GBP currencies and SL to 200 pips, like ghostbiker suggested. D.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Holy crap

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Fantastic results

--- 帖子 #288 ---
DirkH143: - yes more strong settings are better and TP 20 pips for the stoporders are right - for the limitorders you can test 30 Pips TP - I will give in the updated settings on monday 11.07. here

--- 帖子 #289 ---
EA v 1.9, resulted with SL 40pips (400 points), not 200 pips (2000 points) as said.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Wow first loss recorded?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Dear All, my settings for today are a little bit difference ... all are yet positive. 1) All the pairs' strength differences are standardised at 8 - 1.8 = 6.2 (I personally find that the 6.2 is already strong enough, perhaps I'm wrong and at higher risk, yet need to test further ...) 2) No USD pairs at all, means 28 - 7 = 21 pairs Due to the Comment defects, I can't differentiate Stop and Limit orders. SwingMan is brilliant with such dynamic stop and limit orders to detect the current market prices movements, therefore can optimise the chances of getting the best open order prices. Awaiting for Ver 2.5. Thanks, Chin

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Opps, I forgot to mention, I also changed :- 1) GMT trading hours, shorten the trading hours as I find other than the set hours, it is hard to have high currency strengths, waste of time to eye the monitor. 2) Auto_MaximumPerPair = 2

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I have previously recommended for the " commentEA " parameter to write only a letter, because Metatrader no allowed long EA-comments. I have seen that some members use " S " for StopOrders and " L " for LimitOrders settings, which is very good

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Noted with thanks, I just changed to S &amp; L ...

--- 帖子 #295 ---
SwingMan: 1. What is real mean by "Auto MINIMUM Daily Profit Currency" ? (note: sorry iam not test that function yet, because market is closed.) That i looking for is : "Auto MAXIMUM Daily profit currency"= $50= This mean all order is auto closed if: profit &gt;= $50. (equal or bigger than). Iam sure the same like: "Auto MAXIMUM Daily loss currency" , but in opposite way. ("Auto MAXIMUM Daily PROFIT currency" ) 2. Whats comment to input : " Dont Trade Pair". I want to input several pair with Big spread. ==================================================================================== Just setting low EA on diff strength (this is like agressive methode). You can use this setting on SLOW market. But you cannot use "agressive methode" on "BUSY market". ============================================================ TO ALL : Switch off or Re-setting standart : automatic SL and TP. (SL= 10 ATR ; TP = 1 ATR) That is not good ratio RR. You cannot use this setting with real account. As you can see from result : SL 100pips (10 ATR) &amp; TP 10-20pips (1 ATR). One pair hit SL will wipe your profit ,OR will get plus with big DD (big floating minus)

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Nice semantic problem! Can I have a " minimum win " and a " maximum loss " or Can I have a " maximum win " and a " minimum loss " or Can I have a " maximum win " and a " maximum loss " Please you vote for !

--- 帖子 #297 ---
SwingMan: VOTE - I'm for: "Equity daily plus" - and for: "Equity daily loss" new day new luck

--- 帖子 #298 ---
SwingMan: VOTE I am for; " maximum win " and a " minimum loss "

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Vote: " Maximum win " and a " maximum loss " Everybody will easy understand this means. "Maximum win" , means= If total maximum WIN $.. . (will closed all open, except pending) " Maximum Loss " , means= if total maximum LOSS $... (will closed all open, except pending) We cannot win all pair BUT we can auto close when we have TOTAL order is positive. (money in the pocket). Note: This EA auto trade different pair with different spread, so we cannot use fix TP and SL. Because from broker every pair have minimum setting TP &amp; SL.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
- absolutely sure we can trade with fixed TP and fixed SL why not ?? had not to do with a EA and not to do with the spread or minimum distance - most Brokers have not a minimum distance and if, then 1 Pips or so by currencies - look in Post # 278 you can see exactly 20 Pips per StopOrder = 20 Pips for fixed TP in my settings - only if you trade with ATR SL and TP you have not a fixed SL and TP

--- 帖子 #301 ---
To Ghostbiker: Starting on Sunday night, I will further test the settings that I have from last week. I also will test the limit orders with 30 pips tp like you suggested. When do you think can we add the GPB currencies again? Then I test the EA with only 10 pips profit for stop orders and limit orders with a higher lot. Got a questions though. How often do you change the settings of the currency strength settings? I assume the higher the settings the better it is and more safer it is that a trade end up in a win. Am I right? D.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
- start after 45 minutes or 1 hour after TOKYO open not earlier - higher Lot for limits is not so good, better the same Lot us stoporders - I will start on Monday after 150 minutes LOndon open with GBP but with strong strength 8.9 - 0.1 and we can see is good or bad - stoporders are good for 20 Pips (distance minimum 15 or 20 Pips) - limitorders distance 30 Pips / TP 30 Pips - I change only in the test phase for test which settings are the best for me - from Monday USD 8.2 - 1.5 / EUR 8.2 - 1.5 / GBP 8.9 - 0.1 / JPY 8.5 - 1.0 / AUD 8.5 - 1.0 / CAD 8.7 - 0.8 / CHF 8.7 - 0.9 / NZD 8.8 - 0.5 I don't trade the following pairs: NZDCAD, NZDCHF NZD must make the gratest way, is a little currencie, USD make the shortest way for go in the win Example: 5 good orders per day is enough, 3 x stoporder 2 x limitorder = total + 120 Pips / day more orders more risk. Come more Orders on one day is good come lower orders next day is good too here you can see with 4 orders per day you can earn + 20% monthly you must not have 10 or 15 orders DD friday 07.07. evening under 1.5% Attached Image (click to enlarge)

SM, I personally agree with Kalawe, maximum win and maximum loss. His concerns on :- TO ALL : Switch off or Re-setting standart : automatic SL and TP. (SL= 10 ATR ; TP = 1 ATR) That is not good ratio RR. You cannot use this setting with real account. As you can see from result : SL 100pips (10 ATR) &amp; TP 10-20pips (1 ATR). One pair hit SL will wipe your profit ,OR will get plus with big DD (big floating minus) I agree with his point of view. One time of SL will kill all the 10 times of win. Is there any way to mitigate such a "high risk" RR ratio and yet can maintain the profitability in long-term. Thanks

--- 帖子 #304 ---
....... One time of SL will kill all the 10 times of win . Is there any way to mitigate such a "high risk" RR ratio and yet can maintain the profitability in long-term. Thanks[/quote] Right bro, very right. So yes, set RR to at least 1:1, not 10:1 ... or even something like 1:2 or so ...

Right bro, very right. So set RR to at least 1:1, not 10:1 ... or even something like 1:2 or so ...[/quote] Yes, I tried at previous version, risk-return ratio 1:1 or 2:1 is not going to work well. Perhaps I should try 3:1 by next week.

Here the new version - smCSReverse EA_v2.5 Only small changes, but a stricter version... - The width of the Buy/Sell/Close buttons has been reduced - After our voting based on the Daily Profit, we have now the changed names Attached Image Default-Differences (figures between brackets) - In the Default-Difference column we have different colors for possible buy or sell signals Example: Limits for AUD (8.5 - 1.2) Limits for NZD (8.8 - 0.8) If the strength of AUD is greather as for NZD, DefaultDiff = 8.5 - 0.8 = 7.7 / possible Sell-Signal / color Gold If the strength of NZD is greather as for AUD, DefaultDiff = 1.2 - 8.8 = -7.6 / possible Buy-Signal / color Blue Warning: In version 2.5, the signals are calculated stricter than in version 2.4 - In version 2.4, we take in consideration only the StrengthDifference and compare them with the DifferenceLimit. - In version 2.5, the limits on both currencies must be met. As example, for a Sell-Signal on AUDNZD we must have the AUD-Strength &gt;= 8.5 and the NZD-Strength &lt;= 0.8. The condition of the version 2.4 is always satisfied! In post # 302 you have the new limits for currencies recommended by @ghostbiker

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thank you SwingMan ====================================================================================== Every pair have different volatility, maybe for SL is around 20pips is accepted many pair on TF M15. Maybe i will try basket to take profit. ===================================================================================== Maybe You miss understood what i mean. FIX TP and SL of this EA is running OK, iam agree for that and iam using it. note: iam not talking about STOPORDER Distance pips. But Iam talking about FIX: SL=STOPLOSS &amp; TP=TAKING PROFIT. Read also post #274, iam always concerning about wrong number of SL. Off course every pair have different MINIMUM for STOPLOSS and TAKE PROFIT. Your example Post # 278, FIX TP 20 pips is accepted number for your broker on that pair, so your order can executed by EA and there is no problem of that transaction. EA is good on work, but that is not my point. Lets we proof it now:ot 1. First is Turn OFF your automatic TP and SL. 2.Try input number 1 (one) on fix TP and SL column like picture below. When EA get order and send to broker, the result is : You will get BLANK of your TP &amp; SL on your transaction trade. (This is my experience with this EA). Why we get BLANK TP and SL ? Because Broker is not accepted 1pips as a STOPLOSS and TAKE PROFIT for that PAIR. I repeat: For "THAT PAIR". EVERY PAIR Have own MINIMUM TP &amp; SL from BROKER Rules: Try manual trade of 2 pair: EURSUSD &amp; GBPAUD. -Then make SL 10pips manual by edit that 2 trade. You will look minimum number on EDIT page. Maybe EURUSD will accept 10pips, But GBPAUD wont accept 10pips as SL. All that mean is: This ea is trade multi pair. Be carefull when using FIX TP and SL. You cannot using number that under your broker rules. And every pair have own rules for minimum TP and SL.

EA can be set so that the limits give -100 pips? For example.

@ Ghostbiker: How do you come up with the currency strength numbers? Do you watch the strength the whole week? I understand that it has to do with your experience, but you have to go on something else. Do you? D.

@SwingMan: Thank you for your excellent speed work I will test the 2.5 with the original strength settings from your update on a second Account @Kalawe: I don't trade with SL under 10 Pips or 20 Pips and I don't trade with TP under 10 Pips. If the broker had 1, 2 oder 3 Pips minimum distance, this is not a problem. Had a Broker more Pips this is not my Broker DirkH143: I trade with the strength rules since 7 years. In the past manually and I have control on the strength all days for my trading. I trade now too with strength manually with candle M5 - H1 every day with Chart including Fibonacci in trend direction. I want have only 4 - 6 good orders per day, not 15 or 20. More orders more risk. With strong settings come better orders. I will control how much orders come the next days with this setting and we can change it. If I trade other strength I will give in here With strength trading you must have patience

SwingMan, Report: V.25 : fix SL &amp; TP not work. Blank. I tried using 20/20 is not work also, still blank.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Interesting thread, testing v. 25 now on a demo account. Question - rather than running two instances of the EA, one to fire off limit orders and one to fire off stop orders, can this be an option in the EA? For example, a pair meets the CS requirements and both a limit and stop are placed. Once one of the orders is filled, the other is cancelled.. otherwise we're just doubling lot size if both are filled, correct? Right now I'm cancelling the non-filled order manually, but would like to run the EA unattended. Please let me know what you think. BTW, EA recently triggered AUDJPY short .. currently in ~ 16 pips DD. Cheers, GFx

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Today: from today in this time not one new order now

Maybe are you right, but @ghostbiker recomended me to keep both order. ( Please explain to us this ).

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Maybe are your SL/TP to small. Check please the Expert and the Journal pages, maybe find you error messages. Maybe was the Spread to large to set this. For brokers 20 pips (on 4 decimals) are 200 pipets (on 5 decimals) etc...

2 Instances: you need 2 different Magicnumbers 1 x for only stoporders, distance 15 (150) or 20 (200) Pips TP 20 (200) 1 x for only limitorders, distance 30 (300) Pips TP 30 (300) - delete the non filled Pendings after 120 Minutes with automatic it is better for each instances the half Lots for start a account

EA is taking trades on JPY pairs.. AUDJPY { 8.6, 0.1 } and USDJPY { 8.3, 1.0 } (pending). Are you using different settings (market hours or otherwise) such that your EA is not opening any new trades? AUDJPY opened in Tokyo session; currently in 34 pips DD

--- 帖子 #330 ---
- not change the strength settings often - only come 2 days not one order then I change the settings a little - you must have patience by strength trading

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Worked now..thanks

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I'm using these settings on v. 25: USD 8.2 - 1.5 / EUR 8.2 - 1.5 / GBP 8.9 - 0.1 / JPY 8.5 - 1.0 / AUD 8.5 - 1.0 / CAD 8.7 - 0.8 / CHF 8.7 - 0.9 / NZD 8.8 - 0.5 I don't trade the following pairs: NZDCAD, NZDCHF USDJPY short just opened; { 8.3, 1.0 } currently BE.

ghostbiker "1 x for only limitorders, distance 30 (300) Pips TP 30 (300)" What is the name variable to set the distance?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Try with "StopOrders_Distance_Pips"... Is the same for StopOrders and for LimitOrders. Maybe we rename in "StopLimitOrders_Distance_Pips"..."

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Why not? Is a little laptop? The problem is that you need not only a smaller Font Height but also smaller Button Heights.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I've not orders today but I have not in the settings "trade auto" now I have change it 1 x order GBPJPY active sell now 1 x order GBPJPY selllimit pending on a second account both active (in win now) both orders closed in win total + 50 Pips in 45 Minutes (with the Standart strength settings and my stronger settings)

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Yes I noticed the buttons are larger than the fonts. Is it easier to exclude some pairs like, if I don't want to trade AUD delete AUD pairs, or and others?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
@ghostbiker I dont see the GJ going down for 25 pips as you posted. Can you give us the concrete Sell and Buy price or just post it with a wonderful picture as you always do

--- 帖子 #340 ---
You can set the list in " DontTrade_Pairs "

--- 帖子 #341 ---
@DowJames: is nice to go down, are sell orders both: Attached Image (click to enlarge) the Broaker is 3 hours bevor GMT

--- 帖子 #342 ---
NZD pairs with CAD and CHF and AUD with CAD and AUD with CHF

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thx. I was just wondering, cause my GJ hit the TP much later.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
also have AJ and UJ sell orders open. Started before ghostbiker activated his EA. At the moment -110 pips. Now EJ open

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Ghostbiker, baffled to your results today as I ran the v2.4 overnight and was a complete disaster with all losers but 1.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
- hehe overnight is not so good. Start after 1:15 TOKYO open not early or after 0:15 London open and close 16:00 GMT - up to 2 or 3 hours after GMT 24:00 is the strength not so right

--- 帖子 #347 ---
GBPJPY closed with a nice profit, still in USDJPY (-58 DD) and AUDJPY (-63 DD).. let's see what happens. JPY extremely weak since Tokyo.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
- yes by the Yen is the problem is often longer down or longer up, can go 2 days too but you must have patience

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Going to let the EA do its thing today and will follow up with some comments / suggestions later. Good work, SwingMan / ghostbiker and thanks!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
- now 2 new orders: - 1 x GJ sellstop active 1 x GJ selllimit pending

--- 帖子 #351 ---
In what version?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I'm sorry @Js3mwtRc, but if you can not read alone the parameters of an EA, is very dangerous for you to use this EA. Maybe is in v_1x or v2.X but is not my job to search this for you, and my memory is no longer the best. I understand slowly, but forget quickly .

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi Guys: Today I tried the Chimoong . set settings, I started at LO time, automatic trading only Stop order and after about 2 hours I got 3 trades all winner but for Limit order got 2 trades and after about 6 hours both lost for around 8 pips

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Please try to remember they are many!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
@Js3mwtRc: not many you must look in the settings, is total EASY - you must read the settings first in the settings down: Don't Trade_Pairs here give in example: NZDCHF,NZDCAD,CADCHF why not understand ? Is difficult ? Trading is a difficulty and stone way

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Results so far: Stopped on AUDJPY - Ouch! (EA entered with odd parameters; see comments column. I think it was because auto SL / TP was enabled. Lot size entered was .29; guessing EA came up with that number based on Money Management settings.. turned that off. Manually changed TP to +25 and SL -200 per suggestions in the thread and changed lot sizes to .15 / .12 going forward). GBPJPY to TP.. although lot size entered was .13.. was set to .15 in LIMIT EA and .12 in STOP EA. Not sure where .13 came from. Otherwise a great trade and quick. This is what I was expecting. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EA still has USDJPY trades open.. big DD. Again, not sure where .13 lot size is coming from as EAs are set for .15 and .12 respectively. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Will continue testing on demo.. -200 stop is too wide. Will need 10 wins just to recoup this loss. May test different RR settings and see what that looks like.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Sorry my friend, but I use another version of the EA. Of-course I know how to read, also trading is more easy than it was before, thanks to SwingMan's tools. I also wait for your feedback about the dashboard too.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi friends My Ea from monday up to now had no trades why? i think my input may have a problem please help!!

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Now I'm reassured. But with other EA versions I do not know about...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
@mahmood.tava: your settings - it is the spread by your Broker higher then 3 Pips ? Then come not orders, not one ! - is your Lots by your Broker minimum 0.1 then come with 0.5% Risk no orders I self work only with distance and exactly Lots not with automatic ATR or % Risk, if I work with all currency pairs Spread 6.0 By me today's Orders 2 x AUDJPY sell (1xlimit 1 x stop) are open and active (from TOKYO session)

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hello, so far those two days do not look good. Mostly in minus. The 200 SL is breaking the account. Because I am trading purly automatic the System does what it supposed to do. A new Risk Reward needs to be order. I will adjust the EA's settings tomorrow. D.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Found it, it's in the above thread at the images in 2.5v, but it is a reverse option and you use other indicator for this.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Finally stopped out on USDJPY entries. Again, Ouch! ghostbiker, assuming you were hit as well with these trades, or similarly on AUDJPY trades? Didn't see anything posted. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another set of nice trades on GBPJPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Agree with DirkH143, -200 stops are killing demo account. Need to change RR or add filters to prevent these losers. Any idea why EA is still entering .13 lot sizes instead of .15 (LIMIT) and .12 (STOP) as defined in EA settings? EA is flat now. No open or pending trades.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
YEN is diffult today because the BOJ manipulate the Yen down I make new setting with yen more strong now 8.6 - 0.4 - no new orders today since TOKYO

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Yes, unusually weak so makes sense. Going to apply the same settings now.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Today some trades opened. sum: -250 pips No problem, just need now 13 winner in a row.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
late again 2 trades GBPJPY opened GMT 16:26 sellstop and selllimit - with strong settings -come not so much orders- - both in win now, wait for the close pic 08. -12.07. Attached Image (click to enlarge) both GBPJPY closed with + 50 Pips / total today + 140 Pips not so bad Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #368 ---
GJ open, too. Big struggle, guess it will be a long journey for GJ this week. We´ll see.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Another win on GBPJPY.. EA is doing great with this pair - all winners so far. Other JPY pairs not so much, and with -200 SL it will take a lot of winners to make up for the losers. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #370 ---
today no orders yet, have patience

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Trades until now. Only winners. Today no trade opened. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Same here.. the EA has the patience I often lack. Hoping we can optimize it into a profitable tool that can run unattended.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi Swingman, Many thanks for your generosity and the Dashboard and Reverse EA. Great job as always. I've set up to test the Reverse EA version 2.5 with TP as 20 pips and SL at 40 pips with the current default settings, separate window. I wish to see how they do without the huge stoploss. I also plan to manual trade using the Dashboard during the TO, NY and the LO sessions when I can (London middle of night here). However I am having trouble creating a Dashboard chart which shows the divergence dots as show in this post. Do they show only in real time? I am also trying to figure out how to save the Dashboard chart template so that when currency name is clicked that particular template comes up. thx in advance db

--- 帖子 #374 ---
#Post 26 Save a template, give a name or use the name in parameter list.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks for quick reply Swingman, I was trying to figure out which indicator causes the dot to show on the chart. Non are appearing on the Dashboard charts I am creating.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I'am waiting for my 9am o'clock (GMT) posting. A buttons says, it where under "investigation". Why ? Or are waiting of answer from NSA ? Crashbulle PS.: I look to my Page and wondering --&gt; 0 Postings I'm missing the posting's for some years.

Hi Swingman With this EA can i trade a following stategy When daily bar clsoed and new bar starts. Based on strength/weekness of currencies at the time of closing of bar. i want to trade once in day a at start of new daily bar ( may be in next 30 minutes to get better spread) 1. I want to select pair based on highest strenth currncy ( 7 or above) with lowest currency . i can find these value on your currency strengh chart on daily TF. (for example, when daily bas closed JPY was 7 and EUR was lowest 3, i want to place EJ buy order) 2. Same Lowest currency (=&lt;2 or lower) with highest currency. ( some day closed bar , Cad is 2 and AUD 6, i want to trade AUDCAD sell) Thanks MK

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Sounds Great! Like this strategy! Where do you see the individual strength of a particular currency? Mine show currency pairs? I'm probably not looking at your explanation correctly. I do like this approach.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I suppose you need a Dashboard for the daily time frame, with strengths calculated like here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...42#post9016342 Is possible, but I must make some changes, maybe in the next time.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Swingman, Yes i am using same or similar currency spageti chart (developed b you) on daily TF. i do not know the name of indicator at this moment but it is developed by you May be you posted in some other threads ( Robinho system) i downloaded from there and using it. It has lot of potential but with proper MM and trade management. I have some ideas when you have time Just PM me i can shaare with you. Thanks MK

--- 帖子 #381 ---
For the smStrength v2.4 (not the reverse one) I have seen some difference with other currency strength meters especially on the Weekly timeframe the values have some latency (a threshold?) what is the calculation?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Have you read the post #246? I wrote: For daily, weekly etc. time frames " ...you must use an other Strength calculation method, maybe Momentum or MA-slope ". At the time all functions calculate the strength as position of the close between High/Low. For weekly we need as example the yearly High/Low (52 bars).

--- 帖子 #383 ---
- why a strength for the past (weekly) ? - the strength is for now, the strength can change in seconds or minutes or hours from 2.0 to 4.0 or to 8.0 (not in a week) - you don't understand the strength for trading live

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Answer to a PM: Here a little EA which I have adapted from Metatrader Forum. Please check it!

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I don't ask for the reverse indicator... anyway I will try to check the code, but I am not a coder and this will take me much time from my trading. I believe the smStrength v2.4 indicators calculation is done using some kind of threshold which I may don't know yet!

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I am checking for my coding skills, difficult to learn when you must have to be on trading screen too and if my opinion about currency strength agrees with others, I can "say" we agree in all cases. Also I believe that the strength with price is relative and the best option when you want to trade.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hey swingman, i saw that you have an indicator with the name smLondonCloseFiboZones_v2. Can you post that one? Thankx. D.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi Swingman Yes I am using this indicator. When you develop Daily time frame Dashboard, please also include to add more position on retracement after distance of certain pips with a multiply factor for next positions on retracement, with total max positions entered by user. Thanks MK

--- 帖子 #389 ---

Hi swinman ​I am currently testing reversing strategy on daily TF . Most of the time TP hit on same day but some time retrenchment and trade hit TP on next day. In this system addition of positions on retrenchment is an important part of system make it more profitable. Hope to see Dashboard for Daily TF Thanks MK

--- 帖子 #394 ---
It's not that easy. You have to define the StopLosses for the entrys, the exit rules etc. If you formulate a complete strategy, I make private for you a system...

--- 帖子 #395 ---
In the beginning there is so much back and forth. From time to time I check in and see how far along the thread is. I personally trade different and due to work, I can't sit all day long in front of the screen. At least not yet. So, my interests are wide. Just because I am not subscribed anymore does not necessarily means I don't look at a thread anymore. But I know what you mean though.

EA finally took a trade today after not doing anything for a couple of days. In and out in a few minutes - my favorite kind of trade! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Different lot sizes seem to be a function of money management defaulting to RiscPerTrade_Percents instead of NumberOfLots. Any idea how to force it to use NumberOfLots? If not I'll fool around with it when the market opens and see if I can figure it out. Cheers! GFx

hey guys thx for sharing, I am pretty new can someone explane me how I get this stuff to work? I installed the ea in my mt4. I enabled automatic trading in my expert options. I can see the screen with the pair buy sell and close and the pair getting green. What does the change to the green color mean and will this trade automatically or do I have to trade by myself? Sorry for my nub questions ;/ ps. which files do I have to download? maybe someone can post all the files collected? thank you

Hey, The answer of your questions, are still standing, often, very often in the post's in this thread . From beginning to now. But, befor you have to read all this postings, I can say, only 2 Charts ! One for LimitOrders and one for StopOrders . That's all ! But you can change between "Manualy" and "Automatic", too.

Edit:- i got it running. but how it will make orders?? do we have to click on "B" or "S" for placing orders.? i turned automatic mode on. this mean even if i open only two chart windows(stop and limit orders), then also EA will trade on all currency pairs which it find favorable?? i am running this from all day..no single trade made yet. i am doing something wrong?? please advice. ------------- PS:- i am using currency settings by ghostbiker

I wonder always how will you trade without understanding what is at stake. You've read no post in this thread or you would have got that we have here the Currency Strength of 28 pairs and not other things. You should first read about CS and then do what you want.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Results until now. Not bad, but too early to get into celebrations ...

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Bro - you had nice 17 winners during approx. 2 weeks of trading ! Nice one ! Only one looser killed 10 of them ! Are sure about the future development of this account ? The next starting week with only one looser will bring your account in red ! But who knows - may be another second looser will follow immediately .... a bad but possible scenario ? Noone can predict this crazy fx market. So - IMO - yes your pic is a good example and lesson showing how not to do it ! Anyway, I think you'll continue this .... so let us know your results .... who knows: may be you'll beat the laws of statistics As I see you run the bot fully automatically without any manual interventions ... that's we only way I could imagine: semiautomatical trading using the bot + manual interventions !

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Just the results from the ea, not an interpretation. Of course its nonsense to make an interpretation after 28 trades with a CR of 1:10. Could be the expekted variance of probibility distribution.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
no no swingman... when i seen this strength for currency is it available for commodities is my question.. sorry if wrong question. but following your fibozone indicator and it is enough

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Results since last post. Changed stop settings to -65 from -85 (formerly -200) so losing trades are not as devastating to account. In reviewing several trades, DD of over -65 will often continue in the wrong direction and result in a much larger loss. With a few -85 stop loss hits, results are BE overall. SwingMan, thoughts about coding a similar EA using currency strengths but in the direction of the overall trend instead of counter-trend (reversal)? I'm not much of a coder but happy to work through the logic if there is any interest. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers!

Hallo "DerBerliner" schöne Grüße an die "Zurueckgebliebenen" Appel und Katakuja the EA is fully automated

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Here is a new EA version " smCSReverse EA_v3.2 " Some changes and filters, somewhat more strict than the original. - after fulfilled strength conditions, the EA send market orders if: 1. the main stochastic line (9,3,3,Close/Close) cross the signal line in trade direction. The stochastic limits are 30/70. 2. the HullMovingAverage (9) slope is in trade direction For fulfilled condition 1. are drawn arrows, for fulfilled conditions 1. and 2. are drawn arrows in circle. The blue and red circles shows only the divergence of the two currency CS indicator lines. - the automatic StopLoss_ATR_Factor is reduced to 5 Please test the settings... (After some corrections this version was replaced with 3.3)!

--- 帖子 #447 ---

Dear Crashbulle - I have downloaded your SET file (thankyou) and loaded up and I have not had the same results. it took one trade overnight on the USDJPY!.. winner... I have some questions 1. Can you run multiple of the EA in the same MT4 session? i have loaded your stop and limit in the same MT4 session. refer image. 2. I have made an assumption, that you do not need all the charts open for the EA to work? i have tried some other dashboards in the past and you needed every chart open on the timeframe and the template with the setup loaded?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
NO ! you need only ONE Chart and ONE dashboard But will you run MarketOrders AND LimitOrders you need TWO charts not more

I will test this next week. Are you using the same strength settings with this version? Nice results! ___SingleCurrency_StrengthLimits=---------------------------------------------- limits_USD=8.2-1.8 limits_EUR=8.2-1.8 limits_GBP=8.7-0.5 limits_JPY=8.5-1.2 limits_AUD=8.5-1.2 limits_CAD=8.7-0.6 limits_CHF=8.5-1.2 limits_NZD=8.8-0.5

Hey James, schoene Gruesse an die "Zurueckgebliebenen" im DE Forum und die "SalonbackTrader" vom Backtesting laesst es sich gut leben Backtesting ist wie Radrennen rückwärts. Sind wie die tollen Backtests vom Antonov und sonst schrottet er vorwärts die Accounts schneller als die Backtests rückwärts laufen

--- 帖子 #457 ---
ok thanks - I have opened 2 charts now with the 2 EA running - like this.

Hey ghostbiker plz try english or spanish so that i can understand you. Best regards

Hi all, I'm a newbie here... how can I set market and limit orders on the graphs? I don't find this option in the expert tab. Thank you

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hello @Alberto, I were very amused at your ask ! It is in the first line in the expert tab on smC 2.4 ! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #462 ---
The versions 3.x have only market orders!

Hi Ghostbiker, could you describe the concept of currency strenght and how do you define the strenght limits in the expert tab? Thank you p.s. I read the entire thread but I didn't find it.

Not backtested a dashboard. backtested the LC EA. So what are you talking about me after you banned me from the thread@ ghostbiker? Where did you lost your brain idiot? Stop writing german about me.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I tested EA today so far 5 orders opened and 4 of them hit TP Amaizing

--- 帖子 #468 ---
DowJames will put here the backtest of the Dashboard with 17 pairs, we wait where is the backtest DowJames ? Put here or go to the hell

I can show you the backtest of London Close as i told, but there you have banned me cause you are moron? Face the truth.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
@DowJames: you have here written, that you have this EA back testet, where is your backtest for this Dashboard EA with 17 pairs ?? Put here your backtest from this Dashboard EA or go to the hell. You are in one day change from a German to Spanish ? Very fast ! Meinst du ich ziehe mir das Dirndl mit der Beisszange an ? Da musst du viel frueher aufstehen, gehe zu deinen "Zurueckgebliebenen" in DE die kannst mit deinen Maerchen begluecken die freuen sich. Und wenn du so gut traden kannst mache doch hier mal einen Thread mit einem eigenen System auf oder reichts dazu nicht intellektuell ? 30 Jahre trading und wo in Germany oder Spanien ?? Samstag noch in Germany heute schon in Spanien ? Ist Zigarettenschmuggel im Kosovo auch trading? Irgend wie schon, ja

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Where did i post it here? Just backtested LC Close there on posting #1152. Don´t drink too much. I´m trading for 30 years but never have seen such a moron like you.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Here is the new EA version " smCSReverse EA_v3.3 " Some changes and filters, somewhat more strict than the original. - after fulfilled strength conditions, the EA send market orders if: 1. the main stochastic line (9,3,3,Close/Close) cross the signal line in trade direction. The stochastic limits are 30/70. 2. the HullMovingAverage (9) slope is in trade direction For fulfilled condition 1. are drawn arrows, for fulfilled conditions 1. and 2. are drawn arrows in circle. The blue and red circles shows only the divergence of the two currency CS indicator lines. ======================== I hope to have a bit of risk for entry conditions. In the following chart you see that between the first signal with fulfilled strength conditions at 11:30 and the entry at 13:15, the risk was reduced by about 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi Swingman and many thanks for your incredible work! I have 2 quick questions: 1. Why limit orders were removed in the latest versions? I read another time the entire thread but I don't find the reason. 2. I'm using 1366x768 resolution, but I don't see the entire table. I'm trying different resolutions but I don't find the ideal set up. Could you help me? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #474 ---
@SwingMan: thank you for the new update 3.3, I will test it from tomorrow very good idea and work

--- 帖子 #475 ---
- With original rules we have fulfilled strength conditions, and we send stop or limit orders. If you analyse the GBPCHF chart above, or the charts from NZDUSD and AUDCHAF in this moment, you see that after fulfilling the strength conditions we can send a market order because the HullAvg and Stochastic conditions assure us a probabilistic minimum risk... - The resolution on my " developer screen " is 1680 x 1050

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Thank you thank you SwingMan for your effort and hard work -

Hi Osnatw, could you kindly post your graph template? I seem it's the London closing expert Thank you!

There is no problem to reintroduce the limit orders. It was just my idea and it is perhaps unnecessary. If they find this week that it is needed, I will bring them back in the EA.

@GibbonsFX: have you open a Chart USDSEK M15 ?? This pair is out of spread or AUDCHF is out of spread, you must give the spread in the settings higher

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I loaded it on the USDSEK because it's a pair I don't trade.. it's not trading that pair but maybe something about the spread or price caused it to go haywire. Anyway, it's now loaded on a EURCAD chart and seems to be working now. Just entered an NZDUSD trade and is slightly in profit.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I loaded the expert v 3.3 on a EURUSD M15 chart, but I have the same problem. My MaximumAllowed_Spread is 30, may I put an higher spread to allow the trades on some pairs?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
spread 3.0 is to small for some pairs you must have the right spread for ALL pairs you have in the dashboard !!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Ok but in the expert tab I see a single spread field. How can I set a spread for every single pair?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
no not, only max spread for all, if not the Dashboard will not work

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Can you not! It is not economical to program 28 rows with spreads in input...

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Could you indicate the value you use in the max spread field? I have a 129 error on USDJPY buy order, but I have 5 pips as max spread (50 in the field as 5 digits), and USDJPY has a lower spread...

--- 帖子 #500 ---
give in 60 (for 6 Pips) the update 3.3 = 1 order open now 08:57 GMT USDJPY buy

Yep, getting the same error here.. not sure why. 2016.08.02 03:00:01.519 smCSReverse EA_v3.3 EURCAD,M15: ## BuyOrder error 129 invalid price USDJPY So far several triggers and the EA only took an earlier NZDUSD SELL trade, which is currently in DD. All others were 129 errors. Maybe there is a bug with BUY orders?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
let run a history skript on M1 chart (30 - 60 minutes) if you have any "exotic" pair like USDSEK USDTRY on a Chart or so can give some errors

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Correction in the new version smCSReverse EA_v3.3.1 Thank you Gibbons for your remarks... The problem is every time the same: only if I receive error messages I can correct them, and now there were no. But I have found a position in code where the cause may be. Please test !

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Thank you very much Swingman and Ghostbiker ! Now I have an alert on AUDUSD "no GMT trading Time". Is it correct?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Before you ask, please check the settings. This saves time ...

--- 帖子 #506 ---
The expert can't trade between the trading windows indicated under GMT_Forex_Market_Hours ?

Thanks, I will test this one. All errors so far were on BUY orders. SELL orders have been executing.

Hi Swingman, is there the possibility to place the stop in this way? Buy orders: Low[1] - Filter Sell orders: High[1] + Filter Filter managed as extern variable (2 or 3 pips for instance). This could be a way to improve the risk / reward: if the signal is good I expect it performs quite immediatly. Otherwise, it's better to close and wait for another option. But the risk / reward could be &gt;= 1. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Sure is possible, maybe later. What you suggest is an other "strategy" with trailing stops. @Gostbyker recomanded for this version a fix stop. I test further for improvements in version 3.4

--- 帖子 #522 ---
No, I'm not suggesting a trailing stop. I'm only asking to define the initial stop in another way.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi Alberto, Thanks for the template. Basically the EA is not dependent on the template? Joshua

I have set up a fxbook link using v3.3.1. on default settings. https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/csr/1735419

Sure, template is useful to observe the trades set up, while the dashboard works.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
My recent trades with default settings.... I don't understand how the system can be profitable with this risk reward ratio...

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Swingman, just to be sure: if I select the option "Trading Manual" the expert will send orders or not? I see the smile in the upper right corner of the dashboard in both cases (manual or automatically). Thank you.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
You are right, but I programed only an idea. Now you can see that until a system is a winning system, it may take months! Try also the similar 28 pairs system of @bernhard ... For the next version, maybe on weekend, I will programe a martingale hedge...

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Is so simple to test this... Set on "Manual" and if you dont get any trades in two days, all is ok. Why did you ask such simple questions? I'm not a teacher and everybody can use or not an EA, can understand or not how to use the EA.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi swingman, you are great First of all many many thanks for your smcsreverse eav3.3.1. This ea is same like i am thinking since months but need two more things i would be grateful to you if you could add my requested indicator. detail is below. 1. Pip to open 2. supertrend cleared 5 MTFcandle color with alert of 15 min candle colour change and if possible sorted display of pairs according to (pip to open and strength) This is my dream ea and you have made my dream come true you are great. i know that this does not look good that i am telling you to do something for me but please take this as a humble request.waiting for a positive reply.

hi ghostbiker, thanks for your posting. What setting are you using - i got consecutive loss today - on AUD pairs. strange... Thanks.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I have been running v3.3.1 default settings and I have lots of large loss -resulting in overall loss -

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I have also been run the v2.4 stop limit set file and that has performed much better - although I am running a draw down of 50% of the profits at the moment. I closed 50% of 1 trade as it was heading wrong direction after NFP and remainder of the trade is in loss.. I looked at the results last night for each winning trade and the majority of the winning trades did not need a 200point stop - so i believe the stop could be reduced to 80 with TP 20 - I will run a comparative demo for the rest of the week.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
- I trade with the last update 3.3.1 the Marketorders TP 25 (250) SL 50 (500) - I trade with the update 2.5 the Limitorders TP 30 (300) SL 60 (600) and the OrderDistance 25 (250) - I become not so much Orders, because I set more strength the rules of each currency, 3 or 4 orders per day is enough

Hi ghostbiker, i don´t know anything about any antonov but it´s a russian transport airplane. Your shown account seems to be a martingale system. You can see it from growth everyday (other systems thats nearly impossible) but Jun16(maybe here manually correction) and from the fact that it went down within a little time. Typically for martingale, and also the so called "red pips" is typical for martingale. So whats the problem with your account? this could happen to everyone using such a system. I don´t use martingale at all but good luck to you.

Hi Mr. DowJames, I see you have no Idea over the russian History and only a little over the russian airplane. The name Antonov is a normal russian people name. A man with this name had constructed airplanes and other peoples gives their the name Antonov ! But a another people with this name is a youthful hotspur Commercial EA-Seller on the "new very strong Russian-Kapitalismen line" to make only money. When you speak with him, is he first a nice man with good shinning, but when you say him, this or this is not Good or Wrong, then is he pissed and you can see a Inverted man. Do not stand to him in the way, otherwise he Will run over you! His shinning is him very important. You can see "picture 1" befor "Washing- and Cleaning-Day" and in "picture 2" after them, and missed now all "Big-Red Accounts" .

Hello crashbulle, I just knew the airplane and dont give a damn about history, i´m living today. So ghostbiker is antonov or what? Because he was instantly pissed off. You can better say he is acting like a prima donna. Not so nioe at trading, you have to be cool and well-adjusted. I am really sorry for your accounts ghostbiker and if you need help just call me.

You are running both limit order and stop order EA 2.4?

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I created an account just because I was interested in these ideas. I have read all of the thread and I understand the system and the EA. However, as far as I know MT4 isn't capable of backtesting an EA trading multiple pairs, correct? I notice that the activity on this thread has declined, so I was wondering what do you guys think of its long term viability? How has it performed in the past month for anyone who is running it? I will be willing to experiment with it and set up some myfxbook tests with different parameters in order to help everyone, if I knew the cumulative results of the last month for anyone who has been using the system. In my mind, the best parameters to forward test would be the filter and the SL because as with any strategy with a RR like this, the number of SL's hit must be limited or the SL must be reduced, but profitability still encountered.

Hi Swingman, I have just started testing this EA using the counter trend method...had some great results during the London and NY session last night just using the default settings on Auto trade mode. I noticed a couple of potential bugs: 1. The pending orders don't appear to delete after the preset timeframe (I have the Expiration_Time parameter set to 60 minutes); 2. 2 trades out of about 20 trade opened with no SL/TP level (I am using the Auto SL/TP function). I hope the above helps, and thanks again EDIT: Probably didn't help that I was using the same Magic Number as another dash I was running at the same time, oops...will try again next week sorry .

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Please ignore my previous post guys, I couldn't delete it sorry. I realize I was using an older version of the dash. The older Hilo versions seems to have so much potential still

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Two week live test and i have so many lost. A expert advisor who counter trend a lots of currency who have subject to be in a trend for a long time ist not the best, i think. I am curious to test the same expert advisor with the ``reverse`` option. I think the result must be better with reverse. I hope i can help with my comment.

g hostbiker i using your set file from previous post and that give me just loss for version 3.3.1. I dont understand how you win if you respect your stop loss in the set file. I have the same trade that you in the last pic but in lost ;D. How you do to close you order with DBhilo, ?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
hi,please share the tpl,thanks

- trades with HiLo EA is manually with one click NOT automatically

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Strange since in the comments tab is wrote "AUTO"

--- 帖子 #601 ---
- you can't not read the comments?? Why ??

--- 帖子 #602 ---
LOL LOL twice '' NOT auto''

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I don't get you at all... But never mind i don't want to discuss about auto or not. If you say this it must be true. However can you tell which kind of "signal" or strength do you expect to enter into a trade?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
- you can't not read the comments !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! first read then write !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - read Post # 599: trades with HiLo EA is manually with one click NOT automatically (you are a ghostreader hehe) - in the comments: "DBHiLo tp" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Yes ghost now i got it sorry for misunderstanding. I didn't want to offend anyone... Can you share your trading experience with hilo?

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi ghost, The DBHiLo. Which version of EA for your trades with this? Was it the highlowest stop order in v 1.9 and before.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi Swingman, I am working very well with High Low method on version 1.9. Always try to target 2,3 % a day. Your ver 1.9, the option minimum daily profit. Would you mind convert it to maximum daily profit, please. And also that option, it count profit of both closed and floating profit ,right?

--- 帖子 #608 ---
- I work with version smHiLo 1.8.1 + with smReverse 2.5 and version 3.3.1 - smHiLo 1.8.1 this is a EA, but for trading with one click not automatic here my orders 10.10. up to 10.13. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dear Alberto, Does the Strenght Range indicator repaint or not, please? Thanks. Erkan

--- 帖子 #610 ---
no this Strenght Indicator don't not repaint, the date come live

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hi Ghostbiker, How you choose the pairs to run the EA? Thx for your time, Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Well, the results from you are so much an inspiration. Reading through all post, may i make an question on how you decide your SL and TP pips as i c you update it in every single pics. And may i also ask wat broker you are with. After trying couples, i see that FXCM always generate more signal over the XM .

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Boss can i have the EA latest verison i want to try

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Where was the mistake comrade Attached Image (click to enlarge) s?

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi ghostbiker is it smReverse 2.5 on one chart and version 3.3.1 on another chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi GUys, wanted to ask u why is showing me like this ? maybe there was same problem ? cant find post..

--- 帖子 #617 ---
You have sufix in pair name. Add that sufix in EA setup "Pair_Sufix". Attached Image

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hi GhostBiker, Are you still using this EA for auto trading? Still good result?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
In his last picture in other topics, he is still using the EA. But I can see that the SL and TP, there are changes.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
EA smCSReverse v3.3.1 open trade in "automatic mode" when trading time is not alowed !

--- 帖子 #621 ---
how can i add it ? there is no options in EA with some changes of pair

--- 帖子 #622 ---
No? Scroll Input to the end. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #623 ---
my bad... so just add for example EURUS.m ?

--- 帖子 #624 ---
No, you add only ".m"

- I trade this on 3 charts with the EA automatic - limitOrders (smCSReverse EA v2.5) - stoporders (smHiLo DashBoard EA v1.8.1) - strengthlimits (smCSReverse EA v3.3.1) and you must have patience test it with 70 Pips TP and 200 Pips SL (not auto)

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Please more detail and setting pls? Dont you trade with the last setting : 1 for stop/ 1 for limit order with SL200, TP 20 any more?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
ghostbiker do you use the same magic number for the three ea`or different one for each. ``- I trade this on 3 charts with the EA automatic - limitOrders (smCSReverse EA v2.5) - stoporders (smHiLo DashBoard EA v1.8.1) - strengthlimits (smCSReverse EA v3.3.1) and you must have patience test it with 70 Pips TP and 200 Pips SL (not auto)``

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hello Ghostbiker, Can you be kind enough to upload the set files for these ea's ? Kind regards Sarju

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Usually if you use 2 or more EA on same pair, you mast set different magic number. Different magic number can not harm, but same magic number may generate conflict between EAs.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
ok thanks you, i maybe thinking you use one ea to generate you stop loss by hilo and the two others ea to enter in the markets. In this case you must have same magic number.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Dear Ghostbiker, you just set all three of you recommended dashboards. But I can see that this filament ends very sadly. Can you tell me whether such trading yet? I would like to continue with your idea. I will be testing. Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Dear Ghostbiker, I have followed you and your description to set my mt4 smCSReverse EA_V2.5 via (page23)posted smCSR preset.rar. I have opened your set file the smCSReverse_2.5...but I can not understand to set only trading parameters this what means Trading_Style=1, Order_Sending=1, Difference_Limits=0. trading style have two options 1, trading manually 2, trading automatically. which will be? another on order sending have 3options which will be? because you says that limitorders possible but mentioned in set file Order_Sending=1. if one is stop orders. that is to say I want know which will option to set. another Difference_Limits=0 there are two options which will be? limitorders nor only stop orders. please give me a solution. for three options. Thanks Ghostbiker. LimitOrders with update 2.5 (settings for LimitOrders i possible)

--- 帖子 #633 ---

Hello guys. I have a 1 question, is it possible to add s&amp;p500 (SPX500) to the smStrengthRange indicator ?? I know that it must contain 2 pairs for example EUR &amp; USD but how about make SPX500 &amp; USD ?? I really need a spx500 pair so please tell me how to do it. thank you.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
impossible, smStrenghtRange is only for currencies

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I've just found that smStrenghtRange repaints a little, is it true? the line was up a little and when price moved down the line became flat ...

Hello Le Celte, can you please explain what this means pink arrow symbol? Thanks Eve

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Here a new Version: smStrengthRange09_v3 It is the same version as v2.4.1, but you can enable/disable the level lines. They are also disabled for 0 values as input.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Here a new Version: smStrengthRange09_v4 It is the same version as v3, but you can enable/disable the curency lines and the divergence arrows.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
OK SwingMan, as you requested I put here two screenshots that show the difference of smstrenghtrange indicator after changing timeframe to another and back. Sorry I dont know how to put them not as attachments...Anyway I'm very thankful for your great work as I dreamed of that strenght meter couple years ago, exactly what I wanted but my skills in programming are sadly poor! Thanks man. Here are the two charts, first is opened for several hours untouched and second right after I changed TFs. Version is 3.0 As to recompiling it for MT5...It is because I'm using nonstandard TFs in my work like 10 min or 2 hours in my Ninjatrader.....Tried to recompile it using script I found somewhere on the net but it can't recompile, too many errors! I would be very grateful if you as a professional will try to make it work there please! PS. It looks like it repaints constantly just from a day open to the daily close whenever you refresh the chart it will change till the close of the day...

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I checked shortly... - In a first chart I load the indicator - After few minutes I load the indicator in a second chart The lines etc. are not identical! But, when I change the TFs in both charts, the values and the lines are identical. I think that when you load for the first time the indicator, he does not have all the historical data! Now, after ca. one hour, both charts have identical values and lines. Please check this idea, because there is no other reason to calculate different values.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
OK Sir, I will check and let you know of my testing. So I need to open all 28 pairs minimized?

--- 帖子 #650 ---
No, you just have to wait and drink tea

--- 帖子 #651 ---
@ithorror 50 years ago, I had a girlfriend in Kazakhstan. She was a beautiful girl ...

--- 帖子 #652 ---
@SwingMan Really Sir? ) Nowadays our girls are even more beautiful! Come and check, you will be amazed like me what crazy beautys live here now! As to the indis, well my steps to test this wonderful tool are the same every 3 last days: 1. I open my NB at 9 am and start MT4 with opened chart and indi 2. I dont touch it for say 3 hours on M15 TF - no switching TFs, no refreshing, nothing 3. After 3 hours left at 12 am I switch M15 to M5 and back......and what I see? Totally different picture of indis slopes and angles and highs-lows. And this will change even if I refresh every 15min on every new candle TILL the end of MT day. So next day after whole day in chart was built it leaves as is - like in history and unchanged. But during current day it will change till 23:59....Real time building of lines differ from the stonefreezed history! Hope you understand my explanations... Regards, Jean

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Here a new Version: smStrengthRange09_v4.1 Thank you very much for your invitation! I will pursue them next year, and only have to ask my wife when I can do that ... Thanks for the comment with the lines. I think I found the cause, please test the new version. There seem still to be small differences, but it is not important. For the trading you need only the last values, and historically you do not trade and you can make a chart redraw ... More time in debugging can I not invest now because I'm working on a new project, perhaps a simple and interesting system.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Thank you SwingMan for the great indi. Can i ask you a question - I see there is a steep curve on GBPJPY in the circled area. However, the price did not move much - it was pretty flat. What logic in indicator caused this steep curve in this particular case? Thanks mate.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Looks like a new day started.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
You're right! In the source code, row 1227, we have: " dStrengthRange=100.0*(dCloseLow/dailyRange); " At begin of the day is the daily range small, etc., etc. For me this is not the best calculation, but all who dont know how the SR is calculated, prefere to use this indicator . Other formulas use a moving average slope, or the momentum. I think that perhaps better where to use a linear regression...

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi Swingman, does this Indi repaint - after the current bar is closed?

--- 帖子 #658 ---
OK Sir, as to new modification looks like it still do some changes constantly during the day just till 23:59 of the MT time. Here are the pics - first chart is opened and stayed untouched at all and second chart is opened at that last red vertical line. Hope you will find the solution so we can check the history and make a great tool that adds to our way of trading.... For me it looks very promising the way it shows the strength of the currencies!

--- 帖子 #659 ---
At first: now I haven't the time to improve the indicator, I'm sorry ! But: History checking and analysing of the lines is invalid ! With my dashboards posted here, you can save the charts at the moment when the strength difference is fullfiled, as example one pair above 8 and the other below 2 (difference &gt;= 6). Here a chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Only in this moment (11:40:xx) have you this lines, and after few seconds or minutes they change!

--- 帖子 #660 ---
GB, please explain in details, when you place Limit or Pending order and which dashboard do you use?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi SwingMan! Could you please add a switch on/off of that right arrows and currency names with strength numbers of your brilliant smstrengthrange09 4.1 indicator? Thanks Man

--- 帖子 #662 ---
It is possible and the idea is very interesting: One turns off the currency lines, the arrows and the names, and one trades without seeing what it is ...

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Oh I see what you mean, lol! Yeah I work with currency strength indis for so long time that now I don't even see at names - I already knows my color lines (I coupled currencies into 4 different charts for better and clearer view). Thats why I ask you. It would be cool to turn currency lines on/off visible too.... Regards...

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I don't see any lines here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...82#post9305582

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Oh sorry, I mean turn the lines on/off on my choice. E&gt;G&gt; left only GBP and EUR and other currencies not visible....

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Thank you for the indicator. My question is if it is possible to have only currency names section out of the window. Yes,we can disable the currency lines and the divergence arrows. But,I want it on main chart, not on a seperated window. I want to be able to move it anywhere I want like we do for some indicators writing the parameter we want at inputs section.Can we do it ?

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Maybe is better to use " CandleDirectionStoxos " indicator here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...22#post9332922

In fact, there is a small problem with the indicators when drawing for the last bars. I still have to test today and post a corrected version later Remark: the same error is also in the CBG-ULTRA-ADX and other MTF indicators...!

Did not you see?

Thank you SwingMan

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hello SwingMan, do you have smMTFStochastic.ex4 also in mq4 version?. Thank you in advance.

Somewhere I would my SourceCode still have. But why do you need it? I see that many have downloaded the .exe files for their collection.

Thanks for your reply. I need it to add alert options on it and in the future for mq5.

Ah so! PM me please your email adress and I send you the file although he was only meant for @LeCelte ...

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Great work on the smCSReverse EA_v3.3.1. I've been testing it today running it on automatic. Won 10 of 12 trades. However, the EA created a trade at 22:46 GMT which is outside the time limit parameters. Just wanted to alert everyone....tnx.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Can you create non-oscillator version of smStrength? So it can be placed anywhere on the chart.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
You can test this version. Is not finished, is not perfect and I will not continue to work on it in the next time... I believe there is in forum indicators only with the strength values.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Wow SwingMan , is this the same thing that Ghostbiker has used? On chart currency strength bands, nice, will definitely try it, thanks!

--- 帖子 #687 ---
No, is not the same, because GB has much better indicators... Maybe in few weeks If I have the time I programe the indicator as movable panel for you. - Please remember me!

--- 帖子 #688 ---
It will be great, SwingMan! Thank you, I will remind you at the end of next week! P.S. Please make option to hide Fibo grid

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I'm seeing errors with the EA: SELL signal for: GBPJPY 12:02 Strength= 8.0,1.9 Diff=6.1 {6.0} # no GMT trading time!

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Yeh am seeing the same thing ranger_lp. Also the EA has a skull and crossbones up near the top left hand corner. Any kind helpfull people know the soloution??? Have switched back to the earlier version of the EA, EA_v1.9 and that seems to work fine. It seems to have happened since the new year. Maybe there is a 2016 date in the coding somewhere

--- 帖子 #691 ---
That is my guess...versions 2.5 and 3.3.1 wont autotrade and that started after the first of the year...

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Here is version 3.3.2 Please replace the version 3.3.1 Thank you for the comment! In fact, I have set for test purposes a limit until end 2016, and did not think that someone uses the EA ... Change: When clicking the currency name buttons, now is displayed in all open charts on the screen this currency. This I have made if you have e.g. several time frames

--- 帖子 #693 ---
I thank you kind Sir. You are truly a Scholar and a Gentleman I was testing the EA on Demo, auto-trading mainly and the results were outstanding. I want to keep testing it some more and to find out when it breaks Which I am sure at some point it must Nothing, no EA, can be that good My compliments to you for writing it SwingMan and thank you for the 2017 update so promptly Kindest regards Netgold777

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Thank you very much....yes there are those that are using it like myself...

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Thanks SwingMan Could you please make the currency change an option so that if I have multiple currencies open they don't all get changed to the clicked currency? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Very nice, but if you and many others post no results here, I have no motivation to make more additions.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I'll make a point of doing that....I started using your previous version last week of the the previous year and was in the black most days. But now that we have real market conditions, I want to see how profitable it can be. It's one of the better EAs I've seen awhile.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Does this project have a git repo?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Point taken kind Sir. Will post results from next week onwards And thank you again for the update on the EA Which template do you recommend to use with the EA Swingman? The smHiloOpen-1 or the SwingMan_3? I also tend to agree with Trendcap's post about the currency change being an option. I tend to have windows open for all my current trades so I can keep an eye on them on one screen. While working on another screen Kind regards Netgold777

--- 帖子 #700 ---
@trendcap and @Netgold77 Of course I can do that. But if you do not click, nothing happens ... I can make a swich with the old and new functionality on clicking.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Thanks Swingman, that would be perfect!

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Thanks SwingMan. That would be very usefull

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Here is version 3.3.3 only for the active user @trendcap and @Netgold777

Thanks Swingman. Works perfectly!

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Thanks for the update Swingman, kind Sir I haven't had a chance to test drive it yet but will do tomorrow. The fruits of my days labours below. New account started this morning. Well I say my days labours. Two of three were due to your EA Swingman. Thank you kindly again https://www.mql5.com/en/charts/63854...urities-london

Those are good trades i am gonna start mine too..

--- 帖子 #707 ---

--- 帖子 #708 ---
How did you get so many trades? I have mine on since asian session only have 2 win trades closed by itself and 1 is at a loss still running till now.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
I don't only trade the EA Mortas. I take my own trades alongside the EA's trades. Although the way it has gone today for me I would have been far better just letting the EA trade. Too many outside distractions has caused me some losses. I still have 3 auto trades open at the moment. Will post up results when they done Kind regards Netgold777

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Netgold777 do you use singlecurrey strength limits or generalpair? I am using singlecurrency so far those trades all win but generalpair lost ...

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Please test new Version 3.3.4 I think I found the cause in the code, please test. Unfortunately I miss the time for tests, and have not an explanation for your setted times. Maybe try you with generaly times: 01:00 and 22:00 to not disturb the GMT shift...

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Ho Mortas. At the moment I am using/testing GeneralPair_StrengthLimits. This I find is giving me a 90% win rate. I only tend to get problems when I interfere with the trades If it works, don't fix it. I also take my own trades as and when I see what appears to me a good set up. Or if an auto trade is progressing strongly, then I may add to it with larger lots sizes. Have been having problems the last few days with power cuts and broad band dropping out. The joys/problems of living in the country side

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Thank you SwingMan, kind Sir, for the new version. I have it on test at the moment. It seems to functioing perfectly. I am trying to reign in the initial stop loss, as I have found that one trade hitting the original SL can wipe out several trades that have hit the TP. I've adjusted the StopLoss_Pips to 70 Pips initially or 700 points from the original 2000

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thanks SwingMan Auto/Manual trading now works as expected. Tried different time settings as suggested but unfortunately this hasn't fixed the issue. It seems that when broker time goes to next day then trading is disabled until GMT day rolls to the same day as broker.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I've had similar results where I would win 8 of 10 trades in a day and the two losers would wipe out the winners. I think that it might have to do with the strategy...if you have a pair that a strength value over 7 for a long period of time, this is when you get stopped. Don't know how to get around that...I've seen some pairs have big DD only to come back and have a winning trade. After all, it's a counter trade strategy...almost analogous to that COG strategy years ago when you had to accept a 100+ pips DD as part of the strategy....

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Good day today....10 of 10 trades so far. Some of the trades didn't trigger automatically and thusly I had to manually intervene. Still have trades running. Figure 7% gain in my account. Good stuff.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Good trading Ranger. Any chance of having a look at your settings screen Bud? Are you using in the difference_Limits, GeneralPair_StrengthsLimits or SingleCurrency_StrengthsLimits Also are you using the SwingMan_3 template? Although I can't actually remember where I got it from now Have you tried loading any of the .set files with the smCSReverse EA_v3.3.4 ?

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Here is what I'm using...pretty much OOTB except for money management....I had to add the .txt suffix so I can upload the file... Attached File(s) smCSR334.set.txt 3 KB | 412 downloads

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I can't take credit for these results. I just ran automatic except for a couple of trades that didn't trigger that I triggered manually. SwingMan has done a great job on the EA. I used the .set file in the previous post. I find this EA works best on Fridays and worst on Mondays so far. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #720 ---
SwingMan, I have run this with Netgold777 settings with great success on Friday. . ranger lp mentioned that Mondays are not very good for the EA. 1. So I was wondering if you could put an option for the days of the week it would trade or not trade?? 2. Also would it be possible to add an option to stop taking anymore new trades after a certain time on Fridays?? Also it would be appreciated if someone could share the .tpl file that displays from the EA onto the clicked currency pair the indicators used in the EA? Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hi Bruce... You can change the template in the settings to be anything you want. However, if you go to post #514 , you can see one the matches this strategy...

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Ahhhhhh! Thanks Ranger. I appreciate you pointing it out. Thanks! Bruce

--- 帖子 #723 ---
https://www.mql5.com/en/charts/64198...urities-london Well that's my six eggs SwingMan. Can you put a 'Replay' function and a 'Pause' function in the EA please???? (rofl) Salute for a very fine Ea my good Man. Try this. I am not sure if it is any difference from the SwingMan .tpl but this is the one I am using. I am not sure where I got it from.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Bruce. Be carefull I am running at 15% Account risk. I will reduce this as and when account becomes bigger. Or my 'Bottle Coefficient' is exceeded At this setting one or two bad trades will wreck account And just remember, 'Life' begins, just beyond the edge of Our 'Comfort Zones'???? Green pips to all

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Netgold, Yes I saw that 15% risk and since I am still running on Demo I left it as is. Letting it run to see what happens. The other Swingman.tpl looks near to what the EA is operating from. So I am going to still use that so that I can see closer to what the EA is looking for on entry. Thanks again for your settings it was very helpful. Bruce

Just had NZDJPY trade go off outside of the trading window time at 23:15 server time (21:15 GMT). Don't know why that is happening.... Skull and cross bones appears at top of EA....

Thanks, is a useful indicator, I believe that @ghostbiker uses it. - What I miss in panel is the information which procedure is used (Open, Close, Body). - Another problem is that the values are calculated for the current candle. You can not see e.g. in M30 the sentiment on D1. Does anyone need such supplements ...?

--- 帖子 #730 ---
No problem ! May I include an mp3 player ?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
I will try to test the trading hours ...

--- 帖子 #732 ---
- With Friday is OK. - I think it is enough to have a query only for trading on Monday, not for all days.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
SM, this happened a couple of weeks ago, and I think it was around the same time frame also. BTW, the EA is getting hammered because of news today....maybe a news filter might help...otherwise the EA is working great.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
But you can set the trading hours, eventualy check the current news and change the hours.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
You certainly can my good Man and thank you kindly Might I also suggest an 'adult' version of it as well with a coffee/tea machine, sauna and massage function For those times when the market has all the vitality of a rigor mortised tortoise??? It might stop me taking boredom trades

The good news is that will all the trades that went south, I only lost 49 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) The bad news is that I still have 3 trades open -160 pips. Good thing it's a demo....

New version 3.3.5 A few changes and additions, please test the new input parameters ! - When alerts are displayed, are displayed all the charts of the pair, as with the click of the buttons with pair names OnAlert_Change_AllCharts=true; - The pair chart with the default template is stored in moment of an alerts as screen shot in the subfolder "files" SaveScreenShot_Orders=true; SaveScreenShot_Signals=false; - Conditions for trading on monday and friday Last_TradingHour_OnFriday ="14:00"; Trading_OnMonday =true;

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Thanks SwingMan. I especially like that you added Saving screen shots. That is a nice addition for followup on the trades. Thanks again. Bruce

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Swingman, I have installed the new EA, but even though I click on the currency pair to have a chart with the templateName open up. It doesn't open a chart. Yes I do have the correct template file name in the EA. There is not a problem with the older version. Also another question. The screenshot saved... is it taken with the template file listed in the EA ? Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #741 ---
- I have just tested, working properly. Maybe you have to restart the EA. On another computer from me is also happening, will test tomorrow. - Yes, with this template

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Only for @greenway Here is a test for a movable RectanglePanel

Today's results... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #744 ---
I know, today I have also lost in the test! The EA is OK, but the counter signals in automatic modus are not optimal. For live trades, I would not recommend the system at all!

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Good day to everybody. This thread has been started more than 7 months ago but the yet cannot produce consistent good results, Monday is not performing, news hammer the performance, etc. I personally agree that the EA has no problem to execute, but the fundamental essence or system of this EA may need to be reviewed again to find out why it is not performing as expected. The target can at least consistently showing positive net profit per day averagely. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Stick with the original HOLO and you should see profit.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
I'm sure you are rigth! I posted the dashboard "smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3" but no one has tested it to see if in automatic mode gives gains, or whether one can improve something. Sure you can have better results in manual trading, but it would be nice to know if the automation is reliable.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
I'll take a stab at it SM, but the EA is expired so if you could kindly lift that restriction, I can test that for a few days.....

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Results So Far..................... Hi Guys I have been testing the EA 3.3.4 this week and the results are very impressive. Total of 16 trades with 13 winners and 3 losers. Win rate of 81%. Excellent. A big thank you to Swingman for all of his hard work and everyone else that has contributed. Great job. Cheers Gavin

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Are you sure? I just tested the EA ( "smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3" ) and it has no date limit. Post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...44#post8992744

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Ok, I set the NY trading end time to 23:00 and I'm getting skull and bones on top... I also tried setting just London to 00:00-23:59 and got the same result. This was similar to some of the other versions which stopped working around Jan. 3rd or thereabouts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Can share the sets?

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Hmmm, thanks for bringing that up Ranger... I hadn't had a trade pop for a while, but hadn't taken the time to investigate. I wonder if I'm having the same issue.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Here and in #Post 1 there is now the last HiLO version which seems to be in order to me. Sory @ranger , I see now that you write and post about the smCSReverse EA . It is OK. Please dont quote false answers. When I have the time I test the hour settings. We have a local time, a broker server time and a GMT time.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Ok...got that straight, sorry....running now...edit......had to make adjustments to trading times....tnx

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Is there a .set file you would like me to use? You probably have tested this somewhat and could suggest some initial settings for automatic trading. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
@SwingMan Any chance we can have a copy of version 2.5 of your EA which can be used beyond 2016? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Ranger kindly posted his set file on post 718, which is the one I'm using. Thanks Ranger

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Here have you the "unlimited" version!

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I've been further thinking about the time problem. Because there are the three times (local, broker, GMT), in my function for checking the time is probably a mistake. I have to test further to find an explanation. If that happens again, please post an exact description which were the settings, which the local and which the broker time. I guess that must be around the midnight time.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
OK Thanks

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Hmmm...you're thinking about the couple of times when the EA went off outside of the posted times that were set right?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
If you post erroneous orders, it is easier for me to find a solution.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I've started testing smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3. The EA did some weird stuff at first like not setting TP and SL so my results today got skewed (it's over 100 pips but I've been playing around with settings). When I started up the EA, it created hundreds of buy and sell stops that got deleted as they were created so I don't know if that is standard. I would like to suggest one thing as we test moving forward. I'd like to use the same time frames for testing as the smCSReverse EAs default time frames. I'd also like some guidance on whether we use limit orders, stop orders or market/pending orders (I'm running automatic for this exercise). I'll keep everything else out of the box unless someone comes up with something major. Everyone's input is greatly appreciated..tnx.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hi traders! Today I decide to make a forward test EA 3.3.4.I use the set file on post 718.Thanks Ranger and SwingMan.This is the result.The last position is not closed by black magic

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hi, the big problem for me is the time. I wrote the HiLO EA seven months ago and no one has tested it properly. My tests have not convinced me and has programmed now other things. Reheating the cold soups is psychologically heavy for me. I would like to post something new in the next time and if now I have to invest again time for improvements but without great interest, I would have finished the new system only in 1-2 months. What I can say is that HiLO EA and Reverse EA can be improved in automatic mode, but my interest for it is very low. When I see that results are posting I will perhaps still make small changes.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Hi SwingMan, Hope this test results in my real accounts are helpful for your further consideration. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #768 ---
I see the time problem arise under the following conditions: Broker time is GMT+2 Broker day equals GMT day +1. Therefore whilst broker day is ahead of GMT (for the two hours) I get skull and cross bones and am unable to trade (markets are usually quiet and not much opportunity anyway). Settings are 00:00 - 24:00 ( I have tried 02:00-24:00, 00:00-22:00, 00:00-26:00) all tests were unable to activate trading during hours 22:00 to 24:00 GMT. This is the time the broker clock says 00:00 to 02:00 (one day ahead of GMT) Changing local time and/or regional GMT offset had no effect. Can someone else please confirm??

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I'm not sure how SM programed the clocks, but I'm not sure 24:00 is a legitimate setting and I'm pretty sure 26:00 is not. Did you try using 23:59 instead?

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Or, to be on the safe side, 00:01 to 23:59. If 00:00 is a valid time, statistically, the chance of missing a trade that kicks off at that time is very small

--- 帖子 #771 ---
An initial assessment according to the tests: to set the daily end time " 24:00 " is false ! Please use only 23:59 ! Metatrader does not interprete the hour time "24:00" as last trading hour and take "23:00"...

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Tested again with 23:59 Test result negative Attached Image Once the GMT clock rolls past 00:00 trading becomes active. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Here the new version smCSReverse EA_v3.3.6 I have changed the function for the determination of the valid trading intervals and hope it is now correct. Please test them. This time your information was better! Please always if there are errors there are several details to post.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Thanks. Time test successful Attached Image

I cant understand what SL/TP settings are used in Automatic mode? It looks like ATR-based ones, not the ones from Fixed Parametrs.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
I am having a little problem with smHILO Dashboard 2.3 that I hope you may be able to advise on? Everything works as it should except the stop orders. The expiry date is for the exact same time as when sent but also for around 10 days in the future! I have changed inputs to various amounts including default mins of 60. I have changed vps clock and date. Neither of these made any difference. Hope you may be able to enlighten me.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Yes I believe it will be the ATR based ones.

I'm been using since Sydney open on Sunday. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Didn't look good. -200 pips on Monday and break even yesterday. Will have to figure out different settings maybe.

My results have been very much the same. I even contemplated having it reverse all trades.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Hello. I have been following this conversation and decided to try the dashboards. However upon loading, neither one appears to be working. I have checked settings in both dashboards and in my trade platform, but do not see why they are not running. Suggestions? Thanking all in advance. K

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Do you have all pairs showing up in 'market watch'? Also you may need to add your pairs prefix/suffix in inputs

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Have you not seen the settings?

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Yes! Thank you herewego. I needed to add the suffix. Didn't read the instruction manual. Without seeing under the hood, I'll say sweet bit of code writing SwingMan. Thank you one and all. K

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Yes, SwingMan, but is it possible to use my own fixed settings in pips?

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Still having this problem. Note the expiration date and time. This order was placed at 11:15 on 27/1/2017 and should have expired 30 mins later. Hopefull somebody can advice me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Now, with picture, I understand your problem! My order at 11:59 is OK. I guess you use a computer from the future...

--- 帖子 #789 ---
I have 2 computers from the future as they both do the same. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Can you sell me one of your computers from the future for $10,000? I want to track the odds at Lotto . - Is the date in the upper left corner in order? - Here is a new version only for you , with a small correction. In addition, the time is also written in the alerts. New version: smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3.1

--- 帖子 #791 ---
If you buy 10x computers @$10,000 each you qualify for a special 'Back To The Future' discount! Yes the date shown in corner is correct. Thank you for the special, I will try it now.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
It is still doing the same with V2.3.1 The correct time and date is in the alerts though. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Then do the following: Set Expiration to 2-3 minutes for example, and check if the orded is closed. Perhaps your metatrader platform makes a false advertisement.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
It does not close the order if set for + 4 or 5mins The date has to be changed to today and the order will only allow to be modified minimum of +10 minutes

ATR Median indicator for @birdland In general, for ATR there are "wrong" calculations after too long or too short bars. For this reason you could take a "median" value! This means as example: Calculate the ATR for 9 bars, e.g. and sort the calculated values Then cut off the first and the last 3 values and calculate the average of the mean 3 values. For me, visualy and psychologically, the value determined is somewhat more stable ... You can also divide or multiply the calculated ATR values.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
New version smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3.2 I found a little error in one row and I hope now is all OK. I tested before and after modification, and now seems to be in order.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
great! thx. very much swingman. a very good solution.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Thank you swingman, your help to this community is greatly appreciated

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Hello Swingman, I am testing multiple different strategies and I have just finished reading your whole thread, the results seem varied and ghostbiker hasn't posted on here in a while, he was the strongest proponent of this EA. Regardless I am putting it on auto on a demo. I was wondering how the strength values are calculated and if the arrows have any real use or are they there as something we can see to help ease our mind that "this is the market condition." I was wondering this because I was thinking about changing the MA to a EMA 21 and the ATR to 14. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #805 ---
I thought the market timings in the EA were to be listed in GMT and not server time? the EA opened a trade when it was not supposed to. GMT time was not met but server time was and the EA executed an order. EDIT: There is a Skull with bones indicating that order should not be placed also.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
New Version: smHiLO DashBoard EA_v2.3.3 New input parameter: DontTrade_Pairs=""; You can give here a pair list. Please test if it work and I hope you have not other wish, because I'm working to very different things and have the EA no longer in my head ...

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Thank you so much for all you do!

HI Swingman, Is there a chance you would consider modifying your indicator smQuarterV1?

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Found in Platform Tech: @DemandSupply: coincidentally I read your post. Here is a Histogram version of the indicator which I have written for myself. When I have the time I add (only for you) the alerts. On using it I prefere the color changes of the last bar and ignoring for minimum 2 bars...

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Hi SwingMan, Thanks a lot. I appreciate you taking time out to code this and help me. Warm regards

Hi SwingMan, You can add ATR Today on DashBoard EA. Sorry my english.

Hallo SwingMan, I have a question. Is it possible to add high and low W1 to this board? You are about to open up the W1 trend. Thank you and best regards

@SwingMan I just realized that you made the smStrengthRange09_XX indicator &amp; thank you very much you are willing to share it for free. You are a very kind person indeed Actually I have been using paid currency meter indicator on my trade &amp; just aware that smStrengthRange09_v2.4 that I am using give the similar result That's why I am googling for newer version and found your link but also I read that you are stop working on that indicator. Your last version is ver5.1 Here i see you made an EA. So I think it should be better and worth to try I just subscribe the thread &amp; will test your EA.. Thanks again..

--- 帖子 #814 ---
@ swingman Hi , the newest version of the smHiLO Dashboard EA_v2.3.3 lets us click on a symbol on the left side and ALWAYS a new chart pops up!!! Is it possible to program it that way that with a click on one chart the symbol appears in this chart and with another click on another symbol this new currency pops up USING THE SAME CHART??? And.... if there are many different charts open in one profile only this one chart used should change the symbol! ( like the - change symbol on chart - Indicator of dingdong )

How can i draw 5M, 15M, 60M candles in one chart? for exaple, on 5M chart, 15M candle is drawn over 3 candles of 5M candle with thick box. and in the same way, 60M candle is drawn over 12 candles of 5M candle with dashed box. thanks ahead

Dear swingman sorry if I post this in a wrong thread. do you think it is possible please, isolate from smstrengthClusterMom the pivot function in an separate indicator?, I mean an indi that shows only DailyOpen, DailyPivot and DailyPivotAvg lines with long, short allowed and dont trade recommendations? It´s really an awsome tool. edit: knowing that you have little time, if the indicator is not possible, could you tell us how you calculate DailyPivotAvg? thanks in advance.

Hi SwingMan, smCSReverse EA_v3.3.6 I found this system and was testing ist during the last days with demo and also with real account (0.01 Lot) The concept of the system is great... The results are nice and I want to do same more (using with ecn-broker) If I loock at the trades, I think RR 1.5 to 4.5 or maybe 1 to 2 can bring good results to) But I have two technical problems... at my VPS the EA was removed 2 times from chart with the message ''EA was removed by timeout'' and trading time do not work sametimes (for example the EA do not open trades at NY) Can you provide a version without restriction for trading time 00:00 to 24:00 for testing? Best Regards

--- 帖子 #821 ---
ok, I think the thing with the trading time is ok. After the Signal the EA just wit for the Stoch 9,3,3 - sorry my mistake!

--- 帖子 #822 ---
If default is bringing out good results, what about those who have tested for long durations and have set files. I will have to get aquainted with the concept for a while. SwingMan good stuff. Two different settings one chart enabled to set pending ordera and the other to take scalping trades and set pending orders. Then i also saw the reverse version for diff value.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
At default settings the scalp mode seem to work better than the pending stop order. Hmmm Where it gets in is also great.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
At default settings the (AScalp) scalp mode seem to work better than the pending stop order (ACount). Hmmm Where it gets in is also great. Testing it on a demo...the trades are 0.10 as trade size. Most times get into the top of the move down...pretty decent. While other programs get in after...your entries are quite early and its in for a good run, i wonder why called scalper mode. Anyway its going good so far.

Hello did you smHILO Indi repainting the sell / buy points?

Thanks SwingMan for all your support in this thread, Just a quick question about your previous indicator the " smHiLoOpen Lines_v12 In it one could put a pipincrement value and this would be added to the chart from either the "lower open" or the "Higher open" in the HoLo strategy by TooSlow. I would like the increment to be from either the High or the Low instead. I would forever be greatful if you could do this for me because i am testing out something new using your indicator. thanks in advance.

trade manually, then it works well

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Dear swingman, regarding the smStrengthRange CS, as I have observed for a long period of time, the indicator calculates for D1 current (0) MN high / low, for H1 and H4 current (0) W1 high / low and for M5-M30 current (0) D1 high / low. If I am right, it is the reason why the 8.0/5.0/2.0 levels and even the position of the current period corresponding to each currency can ovbidly change with respect to others. May I ask you if it is possible calculate it like this: for D1 previous (-1) MN high/low, for H1 and H4 previous (-1) high/low and for M5-M30 previous (-1) D1 high/low?

--- 帖子 #832 ---
please add auto GMT offset and fix time trade to gmt time

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Hi SwingMan! Wonder if you can put a function that sl in same level H1 high/H1 low, same original rule. Wonder also, when automatic trading does not take any trade if breakout situation Thanks Torbjorn

--- 帖子 #834 ---
HI SwingMan! Its a great system, but you can add GMT offset on this system? Trade manually is working well. Thank you a lot another for you. All the best. Thanks blaid

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hello SwingMan, I have found your smCSReverse EA_v3.3.6 extremely useful ever since I discovered it. So far it calculates the strength on the daily. It will be really great if you could include an option to choose the weekly and monthly in the EA or indicator. Will be much appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #855 ---
hi sir, thank you for this indicator, it is helping me with the history so i can make manual backtest with that, but if you dont mind, would you please add time frame option into this indicator, i mean if the default is DAily high and low, perhaps you could add other time frame option to choose, such as weekly and monthly. thank you.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Please can u add H4 parameters to the indicator as well. for us that trade the H4 time frame and if possible add number of candles it candles it can print lines for Thank you

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Hi Swingman..... When/if time permits, can you add filters the the smhilo dashboard: 2 user defineable ma's to be applied to multiple timeframes when the two ma's are in a trend on user selectable timeframes AND price opens in the hilo 1h box, an alert is triggered For example: price opens in green box (signifying lowest 1hr open) 4h/d/w/m prices are all in an uptrend as the 8ema is above the 21ema on all 4 timeframes alert is triggered Thanks sir!

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Does anyone still use this EA ?

--- 帖子 #859 ---
There is no chance to invest time...

--- 帖子 #860 ---
@Swingman Does it also available for mt5?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I'm particularly interested in the possibility of adding filters to the dashboard to further refine the trading signals. This could help to improve the overall profitability of the EA.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Still true.
