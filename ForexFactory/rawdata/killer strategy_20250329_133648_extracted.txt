Hey Gang, Here is another strategy, very profitable and easy to follow. LONG TRADE: * 1HR Chart. * 6 (CLOSE) EMA * Wait for a candle that is below 6 EMA and doesn't touch 6 EMA. * Wait for next candle that touches the 6 EMA. * From the candle touching 6 EMA, count 10 candled backward and forward and draw a line from 10 candles forward to high of 10 previous candles. * Wait for the candle to close above this line drawn and the next candled to retrace back to that line for long trade with SL of 5pips below the low of candle not touching the 6 EMA. * TP 2 or 3 times of risk. See below.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Just do the opposite for short trades.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Let me make the TP more clear, I use ABCD pattern to see where the price could possibly go depending upon how much it has retraced and I adjust my TP. see below for ex. Once the price hit D, I close half position and rest wait for 2 times of risk.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
This is beauty of this technique, of course needs a little patience. Once you draw the line as described in first post. 2 things can happen. Either the candle will break and close above/below the line OR will reverse. So I shorted again on AU the moment it hit the line drawn then just wait. If the candle closes above the line then get out of trade and wait for long trade (Once the candle touch the line again from above.) OR enjoy the short if it reverse.

You don't really have a clue do you?

Oh god...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Sorry, what are you looking for?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Strategies like this have been working for decades. They just don't work for you. This is similar to one of techniques linda raschke used to teach.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Keep posting and don't react to the naysayers. I would like to hear more.

Short time trading approach scalping is really profitable but scalpers first of all have to ensure lowest trading spreads for bringing profit by using this approach with surely. I want to know by using EUR/USD trading pair is it possible to scalp comfortably. ?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Would be handy to know what pair I am looking at in your screenshots. I wonder that since you are going back 10 candles and forward 10 candles, if you should be using a 20 moving average somehow. But cannot do that analysis because I cannot duplicate your screenshot. Edit: I think Post 4 is AUDUSD, so I tried to line up your lines. It shows a space of 24 candles, not 20, but it is hard to see when your pic is so compressed. I added SMA 20 and it looks like your trend lines are its tangent, so it might be worth your while to check it out. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Read first post It's 6 EMA on hourly chart

--- 帖子 #13 ---
That part isn't a moving average. The high of the 10 previous candles is called the upper line of a "10 period Donchian channel".

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Sorry but I don't have a currency pair called 6 EMA.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yeah, no idea what you are talking about, but 10 back + 10 forward = 20 periods. If you want to play with Donchain channels, all good. I am not interested in them. Thanks. I am looking at a much more advanced analysis. I am a computational and graphical statistician. I want to analyze the possibility of using moving averages in place of the trend lines to simplify this trading pattern. I cannot do it since I do not know what pair is being shown. My initial analysis shows the trend lines are tangents to the curve...which means the lines and the moving average come into contact with each other. Drawing a trend line from a point 10 periods back to a point 10 periods forward is a 20 period moving average measurement. I would like to see if there is a consistent trading rule applicable to limit head fakes and define the areas of the swing between signals.

looks like there is more to add here. I will post more charts with example in short while.

If the order triggered and candle closes above the line, the order will be closed and will wait for next candles to touch the line from above for long order.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Long order taken on NZDUSD, will remain long as long the 1HR candle doesn't close below the line.

I like it, subscribed! Waiting for other examples, explanation etc. i have a question regard the screenshot: What if the price go down entering in the triangle?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Price may go down and enter the triangle, but the candle should not close inside the triangle, if it does get out of the trade. See below for example, I am still in trade unless the candle closes inside the triangle.

Here is long trade setup for EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for sharing, but I don't see how the line in this chart is drawn according to rules in first post.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
yea can u explain the drawing process again?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
You need to count 10 candles backward from candle touching 6EMA, and draw the line to high/low of those 10 candles.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
1. Identify the candle not touching 6 EMA. 2. Wait for next candles to touch the 6 EMA. 3. From the candle touching the 6 EMA count 10 candles forward and 10 candle backward. From the OPEN of candle (Not touching 6EMA) draw a straight line upto 10 candle forward (From the candle touching 6EMA). 4. From the end of straight line drawn (10 candles forward), try to draw a line touching high or low of backward candles. it will form a triangle. 5. Now if the candle is touching the line from above (Depends upon how the setup is) go LONG the moment it touch the line (Get out of the trade if candle closes below the line, and wait for candle to touch the line from below for short trade) Hope it clarifies .... Try the same rules on Daily chart as well, it give you better understanding of where you may need to take profits. For Ex on NZDUSD trade I am expecting it to hit 0.7240 for today, if it doesn't then tomorrow 0.7230 may be.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Another setup for USDJPY

--- 帖子 #33 ---
My long order triggered on EU.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thank you! That makes it crystal clear

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Ecclesiastes 1:9 YES

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I am out of EU long trade,as the candle closed below the line convincingly.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank you for additional data. I only do this type of analysis on weekends when there is no trading, so I will post any opinions next weekend.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Took my long trade profit at 0.7230 and my sell at 0.7230 is triggered, daily candle didnt close above the line ...

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Also UJ long trade triggered at 109.00, as the candle didn't close below the line. but this one is risky, due to another short trade setup. I will get out of long at break even OR if the daily candle close below big line.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Looks like EU is getting ready for short trade. Will wait for Candle to close below the line and trace back to it for short trade.

"Wait the candles touch ema 6" It doesn't have to be closed below/above ema 6 right? regards, Tom

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Looks like you are trying to touch the high/low of 10th candle backward. you need touch the recent high/low from all backward candles.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
This one is close, but again try to touch the recent low of all backward 10 candles.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yes, candle needs to touch the 6EMA.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
but in this pic it seeems like you go straigth to the 10th high of the 10th candle backward the ones touching ema, "snobbing" the other 9 candles

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Yes, because that highest in past 10 back candles

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Here is UJ trade taken yesterday.., I know it a little risky due to MACD divergence, but i have used the SL to break even now.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Where did you discovered this strategy? Is it a live account? And for how long you have used it? I'm just curious about this approach... I'd like to understand the logic behind these lines. Why 10 candles back and 10 forward? Why not 11? And what are these lines? A sort of trendlines?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Well, honestly, i have lost money (not in this strategy though), but always curious to see why i always loose despite everything is in the chart, so i started studying into the charts of my own, and wondered why not speculate the price 10 candles forward? So i looked into the history and observed this happening most of the time. So decided to give it a try on live account, yes LIVE Account, I don't like to trade on demo as i often take things lightly while on Demo. You get serious when to see your real money going away. So far I have used it from past 2 months and got some pretty good results, I have not gotten what i have lost so far yet, but i will keep trying and not going to give up .

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Anyone shorting NZDUSD? This is going to be big, I shorted at 0.7330

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Keep posting, i'm interested :-) Let's see how this trade will end Edit: I don't understand... the line don't go 10 candles backward, but much more; why?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Am i missing something...?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
" From the candle touching 6 EMA, count 10 candled backward and forward and draw a line from 10 candles forward to high of 10 previous candles." abhirag, can you please explain more clearly about this in a chart? Reaaly very confusing for me. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
No you are not, it should be like below.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
How many setups have you tested?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Mmh... this is 5 candles back, and anyway this is totally different from your setup... You'r line goes A LOT more of 10 candles backward: Why? My impression is that you don't know and you don't have rules.... You take trades based on your own discretional interpretation, i' m saying this because your setup don't respect the rules of the first post. Maybe i'm wrong , but explain us what is wrong with my screenshot.. You are 15+ candles backward, not 10. This is so confusing. Explain it clearly pls

--- 帖子 #61 ---
thats true thats why he cant asnwer my question

--- 帖子 #62 ---
No my Friend, there are rules as mentioned in posts before. If you stretch the line in NZDUSD weekly chart as below it doesn't make much difference. its just that sometime i try to be more safe OR when its weekly I like to get in trade a little early, just to avoid missing the big trade.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Lol, I will be repeating myself again, I have already explained it twice, you may want to read the full thread again. You are always welcome if you need any clarifications.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Setup for EURUSD, interested in short trade only. MACD divergence is in play. Wait for candle to Daily candle to close below the line, set pending short order near the line again.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Gold Short setup.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
NZDUSD Short setup on 1HR. If the candle closes below the line, set pending short order .7250 with TP of .7205, get out of trade if the candle closes above line OR within the triangle.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
But this setup don't respect the rules of the first post. Both red candles are touching the Moving average, and the line don't go 10 candles backward. Still no understanding.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Wait for a candle that is below 6 EMA and doesn't touch 6 EMA. * Wait for next candle that touches the 6 EMA. * From the candle touching 6 EMA, count 10 candled backward You'r words. Show me where these parameters are respected in the last screenshot

--- 帖子 #69 ---
As I understand now, its not on the 10th candle that you draw the line but the lowest/highest of the last 10 candles. But he also talked about 10 candles forward which seems not application on this.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello Guys, Can you do the same analysis of USD/ILS please?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
And Both candles are touching MA. Italiano? Anch'io ☺

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hey, this also took me some time As i understood you have to draw 10 candles forward from the one candle that touches the 6EMA and then you need to draw the line from the edge of this straight line to the lowest/highest candle of the 10 backwards candles (Counting from the touching candle backwards). Sometimes it is even possible to draw the line longer then 10 candles but the 10 candles should be enough. I did not tried it in a trade, just backtested and it seems to work as described.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
This was a setup for short trade, so we look for candle above 6 EMA and not touching it.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
See what happens when we loose patience and trigger early trade. I am still in trade, but it could have been better, if I waited not broken the rules .

--- 帖子 #75 ---
when you say you have not gotten what you've lost, I'm just curious, whats the win/loss ratio? have you made any decent money using this strategy and can it be used on any pair?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
its just past few months (Since end of Dec last year 2016) when i observed this and started using it. Its been very profitable, i have not calculated the win/loss ratio, but my equity is much more than my investment. again this is only one of the multiple strategies that i use.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hope who followed me took these trades on XAUUSD...

GBPUSD Short setup...

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Interesting IDEA. Thanks for sharing It will help me think differently. After reading and watching all the chart you share. I think You are Objective in case of counting candle but When comes to draw trend line you become subjective. YOU use your personal intuitions. I recommend you to be Objective. You can use 45 Degree angle when comes to drawing angle It will become more objective. YOu can clearly see whether your idea is working in the market. If your idea work above 50% use it. If not You know what you have to do. Please make it objective I hope you can make some money.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks for the feedback, but again, the lines drawn are not to touch the exact low/high of tenth candle, but to identify the best high/low point among all 10 candles. so it can be of any candle among those 10 candles. hope you getting the idea.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Pending sell order set at 1.3435.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
If the candle that touch the 6 ema is now.. then it's impossible to count the 10th candle forward?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hope some of you have taken this trade....

Still in the trade, looking to take profit at 1.3050.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi abhirag, Thank you for sharing. I want to ask. When we open the position (by the rules) and the next candle closes IN the triangle we close the position, but if the price again breaks the trend line and we have entry reopen position? And one more question. From hanging or from a candle to a hat that touches an EMA, draw the horizontal line 10 candles forward? Thanks in advance ! P.S. Sry for my bad english! ... and good luck !

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Sorry, couldnt understand what you are asking, please try to attached the screen shot. Yes, draw the horizontal line 10 candle forward from candle touching the 6EMA.

Yes, its partially correct. You need to touch the best high/low of 10 candles backward. To me it should touch the high of 7th candle backward.

One major issue with the systems where "you need to wait until..." is that they're just not practical. Unless you want to spend all day in front of the computer screen waiting until some event occurs. It's better to work on a method so that at a specific time each day, one can make a decision for the upcoming day, then place the trade and be done with it.

--- 帖子 #129 ---

You lost me man... I was asking for current setups. When did we have a candle below or above 6EMA was not my question and is not of any use to me atm

--- 帖子 #157 ---
If you trade this pattern in lower timefram you are with the train, so you are looking for a late entry. I do not say that this will not work, but it is easier to look deeper only well known patterns. This has worked for long time and will work even longer as many of the methods here. But ... we will see how your trade will work. Please show us the result of this trade.

I agree, but unfortunately, there is no 100% winning strategy, but its profitable at the end.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
thanks for the answer abhirag. and thanks for the tip, MichaelSch. about your suggestion to look on lower TF, which TF u recommend? is this strategy works in lower than H1? (bcos from abhirag's rule, he use only from H1 to W1). cheers.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
If you have this picture in H1, you can choose M15 or M5. I myself trade in smaller timefram and do not use H1. The market is fractal. So look for pattern in the smaller TFs that confirm the pattern in H1. You will find an entry. I will not take this here in other direction, only to show the look behind the moving average and the drawings.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I signup to Forex Factory just because I want to make this post. I have tested abhirag Killer Strategy a few days ago. This technique is very simple, easy to setup and the accuracy is very high to win the trade. I just follow the rule and trade in H1 TF. I have nothing to comment except trading with real money by next week. A big thank you to abhirag for his excellent contribution. As for newbie, this technique really powerful.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Nice looking graph Kimee, welcome to FF and thanks for kind words.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi abhirag, I have a question concerning the picture from post 136. You said that you wait to close below the line and then set pending short. This is correct and following your rules. But ... If I watch at post 22, for example, in about the same situation, you didn't wait for closing below the line, you went directly long at touching the line. OK, you said that if the candle would go below the line you would close with a loss. But this direct entry isn't per your rules, and it's kind of aggressive. Why did you thought that you have a chance of success going directly long ? Do you suggest to take this direct entry every time, or only sometimes ? If sometimes, how you filter all the touchings of the line ? Moreover, in the situation from post 136, if you would take the direct long entry, it would have been a loss, but you didn't took it, you waited for closing below the line. Why ? Why sometimes you took the direct entry long after just touch the line from above and sometimes you waited for closing below the line and took the short after touching the line from below ? And thanks for sharing this simple tool. I understand one value of it: it protects from overtrading. Why? Because the trigger line is always oblique, it isn't horizontal. As consequence it doesn't intersect the price too many times, like a horizontal one does in a range. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
This is true, I do take trades like that as this line works like a major support OR resistance depending upon from above or below. But again, I take a risk by taking trades against the rules as there is no SL in this case and i have to keep monitoring the price to be able to close the trade and avoid the heavy loss. Sorry, I should have mentioned that in posts, but again, please do not take trades against the rules if you cant monitor the price, if you do, then make sure to close it if the candle closes below or above the line against the trade.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi, Just food for thought, maybe it's inspiring for someone... We can build a horizontal line like this: - after having that oblique line, consider the candle not touching 6EMA before the candle that touches it; - go backward until a candle that does touch 6EMA; - go forward one candle ( it'll be the first one that didn't touched 6EMA in the current measurement cycle ); - put a vertical line through it; - where this vertical line intersects the original oblique one, put a horizontal line. You will obtain some good S/R lines. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you build opposite triangles, for choppy action, you can obtain a range. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the price respect this range, no reason to build new triangles ( even if the price makes new touch-notouch cycles ). And finally, you can build a sort of grid, but oblique ( using echidistant channels ) ... and "this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship" with Gann ideas ...

Hi abhirag, Concerning the example of the last trade on GU, here it is one more situation when a good resistance line can be obtained from the triangle ( green lines are from H1, violet from H4 ): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Agreed.... my main objective is to let everyone get the basic idea of trade setup, you may modify it according to your style....

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thank you for the basic ideea! Take care! Cheers

--- 帖子 #180 ---
If the trade setup is on 4HR, I would not go an look at 1HR chart for entry, based on the lines drawn on 4HR chart. the 1HR candle may close between triangle, but its the 4HR candle that will decide is the trade is still valid.

tried these methods few times, very satisfying result. with monitoring bigger timeframe, this combination is a blast. thanks for inspiring, mate! cheers

--- 帖子 #183 ---
i did your tip, use M5 and M15. and always goes along with H1 trend. pretty well result so far. it seems that even the price against our position on small timeframe, it's still safe to hold if we follow bigger timeframe. there's always a safe way out. hope this gonna be the best strategy. fingercrossed

Hi tomiko, I think you got it. Indeed it's pure blast! It has two essential qualities: - it's very simple; - it's leading, not lagging. Again many thanks to abhirag ! I will add only one more element: Fibo expansion. I find it very useful in the cases when price just take off from the triangle, without ever (re)touching the triangle ( like in the original set-up ). How can we build some very solid S/R lines using Fibo expansion: - build the triangle using original algorithm; - build S/R region using the algorithm that I proposed; - take the fibo expansion tool - it needs 3 points to be defined; - place first point at the origin of triangle - the open of non-touching candle; - place second point at the top of triangle - the last pivot ( or the most prominent one ); - place third point at the level of S/R line detected at step 2; - set as visible levels in Fibo tool 0.618, 1, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236. Here it is an example : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here it is the power of the lines provided by this tool: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here it is a detail of the previous snapshot ( remember that the colored lines were built two days ago - they are leading ): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course, some common sense is needed, in order to draw only the important lines and triangles, or otherwise you will have a mess of lines everywhere ... For me, the combo formed by the triangle, the main S/R line ( or area ) given by the non-touching candles and the fibo expansion tool is like a ( good ) translator of the price action. Hope this helps. Cheers

Abhirag, Looks like a great system. I have never been able to understand your very first chart explaining the set-up. Maybe there are others in the same boat. The line you drew doesn't look like it connects the H of the previous 10 with the 10th candle forward. Any way you could post another chart explaining it- maybe not so dark if that's possible. It's hard to see. I'm sorry to be a pain, but I would really like to "get" it. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Abhirag I hope you don't mind if I take a shot at this to answer Bill's question, you can confirm if I have it right. He is drawing a horizontal line from the lowest body of either of the two candles among the one not touching the 6ema and the one that touches. The angled line starts at the high of all of the prior 10 candles before the candle that first touches the 6ema and connects to the horizontal line at the tenth candle after the one touching the 6ema. His charts have been accurate throughout the thread, I do believe that in the first chart you reference it actually is connecting to the 8th candle past the first touching candle. He didn't draw the horizontal line in the first pic of the thread but has done so in later posts. It doesn't change anything much, it would still be a winning trade just the entry would be a little different. I added white lines to the pic below which shows what I am talking about. I am finding this to be a good system through testing so far, for the most part Abhirag has been making live calls, posting setups and entries at the beginning then the results hours later. He has posted both winning and losing trades honestly.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thank you very much. That really helped. With that I'll try to catch up on the rest of it. Thanks again. Bill

--- 帖子 #193 ---
This thread isn't popular or sexy because it requires patience, it's not the latest M1 scalping sensation or the next Martingale wonder EA. Testing takes a long time because you have to consider every setup and manually draw the lines. But it looks good I think.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
This one closed manually at loss -23 pips.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
My first try. Is this a valid trade setup? X is the bar that touched the ma. The down arrow was the trade entrance Short.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
To anyone who knows, Do we always concentrate on the most recent setup? Example- If we spotted one set up and another one develops, do we forget the previous one and watch the newer one? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
This is a not a valid setup Bill, the next candles (after the candle not touching the 6EMA) has already broken the highs if candle not touching the 6EMA, hence invalidate the setup. the price should remain below the highs of candle not touching the 6EMA (For short trade).

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I only look to take profit as per ABCD pattern, if the a new setup is in making or ready, I take the trade.

abhirag, where should the vertical line in your charts be drawn? on open on the candle crossing ema6? on open of the candle before ema6 crossing candle? on low of candle crossing ema6? I have seen you drawing the vertical line in both cases..

--- 帖子 #203 ---
abhirag, according to your rules we wouldn't have taken this short on last candle, but waiting for retrace to red arrow. In an earlier post you still took the trade. If i will take the trade i had to put in sellstop the day before. Shall we wait for retrace or not?

Abhirag says you shall draw line to the highest in previous 10 candles meaning you have drawn it 5 candles to long. I draw the line in your screenshot and then you don't have any long signal...

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Thank you for help me out, here is why i choose that candle , can u check it where i go wrong

--- 帖子 #218 ---
You have to think 10 candles to the left OR the highest of these 10 candles.. In this screenshot the highest candle of 10 candles to the left is candle nr 5.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
EURCAD massive rising above green line today. According to Abhirag we now have to wait for retrace down to 1.48775 before taking the trade. Waiting for retrace make us on daily chart missing trade opportunities...

--- 帖子 #220 ---
ok, i get that but that 10 candles to the left actually is the highest one

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Ok, one more thing you can read between the lines in this thread is that your drawn line isn't allowed to intersect with another candle which is the case here where your line is crossing candle 5 which isn't allowed.

Wow, today was fierce. Someone came in?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Yes, ABCD pattern

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hello abhirag, I am asking something you explained already but I just didnt catch the 10 candles back and forward......do I could backwards the from the previous candles that is not touching the ema and call that #1....... all the way to 10 and i draw a trend-line? What puzzled me is the 10 candles forward,do I have to wait until the 10th candle created and connect that trend-line?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi scsstnt, the 10 candles forward are future candles, you just need to count 10 steps forward depending upon the time chart you are looking at and draw the line to touch to high of 10 candles backwards (none of the 10 candles backward should cross the line). The counting should be done from candle touching 6 EMA. Consider the candle touching 6EMA as candle '0'.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thank you so much abhirag my friend,I will observe in historical charts.....may god bless you and keep you well,continue your excellent contribution,more than respect.:-)

--- 帖子 #247 ---
1 More question please :-) We can have a touch on the 6 EMA from the top/bottom which would be 2 bearish/bullish candles ,the 1st not touching and the 2nd making contact,does both got to be bearish consecutive or lets say for some reason in between a bullish candle appeared then another bearish candle formed.Just getting the perfect setup so I wont ask anything again :-) thank you.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Not sure if got your question right, but it doesn't matter, simply * for BUY trade we look for candle not touching 6EMA, followed by candle touching 6EMA (the number 0 candle, lets say), then count 0 + 10 forward steps and 0-10 backward steps and draw the line, then just wait for any candle to close above the line, once identified, place pending BUY LIMIT order at retrace of line. * For SELL, just opposite of BUY.

Thank u sir for the knowledge. the simplicity of this system are very good. of course there are no holygrail system, if have one for sure i will put all my money and go full margin to buy the world. for my view, the setup will be more accurate if there have candle reverse pattern( bullish/bearish engulf, wiseman, hammer, doji ) before candle that break ema 6. not modifying the system, just to increase the level of entry confidence.

Yes, you may use your own filter to make it more robust strategy, I have been working on getting this into an EA, but still not able to code the right setup. I am not the coder btw, just getting someones help.

i dont know what actually killer or powerful strategy that is able to make sure consistence profit when trading, according to me, despite of having most powerful analyzing trading knowledge there is no chance to bring regular profit without real money management , so we should develop our money management first of all.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yes, and I agree with what you said. First, you can't make a regular income from forex trading, Its a business where you may have losses, but with proper money management you can always minimize losses and maximize profits when the market moves in your favor.

Great idea to backtest your strategy up with at least 3 - 5 years historical price feeds and see if it works. Good luck!

Hi guys. Thanks for this method abhirag. Liking it. One question i have. Do we draw the 10 candle forward line off the open or the high/low of the ema touching candle?Looks like the open on your charts, but im not sure. Many thanks. K.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hello guys, In my spare time I made this indicator according to the rules given, it is only in the initial phase, but it seems to work well. If you want to show passed set-up, use the shift parameter to set the starting candle from which to search for the signal, like this one on EUR USD (shift 5), or the second (shift 10)

--- 帖子 #312 ---
On post #31, abhirag wrote to use the open of non touching EMA candle.

This is one of the strategies I use, so can't really provide a return report.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi Abhirag, When do you decide to go long or short? Is it when the wick touched the trendline inside or outside the triangle? On the examples you posted before (see screenshot attached), I noticed that you were placing orders while the candle is still inside the triangle. Some when the candle closes outside it then wait for retest. Also, where do you place your TP and SL? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Bro, I think you need to adjust your indi as it only counts 9 candles forward from the candle touching the 6 EMA. Also, the horizontal line should be drawn from the open/close of the candle not touching the 6 EMA, following these examples. See attached images. Correct me if I'm wrong here, Abhirag. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
When the candle's wick touches from outside the triangle.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
The SL/TP is based ABCD pattern.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Noted. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
First of all thnks to all the persons taht apreciated my indi and left feedback. For the first point, You are right I count the touching EMA' bar as candle one, but readind better what Abhirag wrote it should be candle zero, I'll do the modification, about the second point isn't so clear because, as I worte, Abhirag told (in capital letter) on post 31 to use the open of the non touching EMA candle, He did'nt told to use the lowest value from open and close.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Ok Guys, I modified the forward count of candle now it'scorrect. Working on code I added some new stuff, because the indicator is looking for a set-up on every new candle, it's possible that a new set-up will form and deleting old set-up. For preventing this situation I added 2 button 1) lock set-up and 2) delete all lines. The first button lock the current set-up on specific time frame so if a new set-up is forming, the old remain there, You can use also this button to show more than one set-up without using two or more indicator; simply change the shift parameter, and click on lock set-up button. The button "delete lines" is self explaniatory. Enjoy P.S. For those dowloaded the first release please re download and subsititute the old file this is an example of how to use one indicator to show 2 or more set-up on a specifIed TF : in this graph I used first shift 5 parameter, then i clicked on the button "lock set-up", then I changed the shift to 10. I repeat myself, every locked set-up will be shown ONLY on the TF was saved, to leave chart clean on the others TF. P.S. 2 sorry guys with market open I found some problems that now are solved, the attached indi is now working ok.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Thanks to abhirag for this strategy, testing the indicator on TF 1 min, it's clear that the levels indicated are respected and important (I used TF 1min only for testing purpose)

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thanks Vitto for this indicator. It seems simple and elegant. What purpose does the shift function serve? It seems to move the 10 candle count back in time, but why would we ever want to do this?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Abhirag, Here is my attempt to explain your system; will you please let me know if I have the correct details? On a chart with a 6 period EMA... A valid signal is generated when a candle touches the EMA whose immediate neighbour is NOT touching the EMA . The candle touching the EMA is the 'signal candle'. The candle prior to the signal candle is the 'horizontal line candle'. Draw a horizontal line forward in time 10 candles from the opening price of the horizontal line candle. This is the 'horizontal line'. 10 candles backward in time from the signal candle is the 'past zone'. Draw a trendline starting from the end of the horizontal line that is not touching the horizontal line candle to the highest high (for long trades) or the lowest low (for short trades) found within the 'past zone'. This trendline is the 'entry line'. Enter when price crosses the 'entry line'. Place your SL 5 pips below the low of the horizontal line candle for long trades or 5 pips above the high of the horizontal line candle for short trades. Exit a trade when price crosses the entryline but closes inside the triangle formed by the entryline and the horizontal line. Does this mean for any future candle or only on the candle which initiated the trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Thanks Clemmo, yes, the explanation is on spot. The trade should be closed if any candle closes inside the triangle OR if hit the SL.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
What if the price once again crosses the entry line should the trade be put on again or wait for a different setup?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Sorry, didn't really get the question. We go long/short when the price touches the Triangle, and get out of the trade if the candle closes inside the triangle.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Thanks for your patience with my questions. Based on that, I made a 100 trade backtest using EU H1 from a random starting date (2017.03.07) using 1:2 risk:reward. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note the recovery that occurs around trade 51 is the result of the EU price spike on 2017.04.24 mostly a lucky result. The results appear to be random which conforms to my initial intuition about this system. Some possible reasons: This period of time was somehow not conducive to the strategy A 6 period MA is not sufficient to filter out random moves and is essentially random The crossing of a 6 period MA is therefore not significant The candle prior to the candle that crossed the MA is also not significant and a 5 pip SL placed above it is fairly tight on H1, likely to get hit often. During ranges results are close to random but during trends they are slightly worse than random because counter-trend trades will signal more often. This is because your setup requires price to be on the counter-trend side of the MA before a signal can be produced, but price will spend more time on the trend-side of the MA, going for longer periods without crossing back, which is to be expected from a trend. In any case I don't know how this system could be 'very profitable' and I urge you to use caution if you decide to continue trading it.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
the point nbr 8 is wrong, you enter a trade when a candle close over the triangle line, and then touch it. This is useful if You want to see a past set-up that it's still valid, look at my previous example on EUR-USD Daily.
