A simple and elegant system graphic analysis for trading on any currency pairs and any timeframes. The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with TL, S/R, Fibonacci levels.

Advantages of FCP:

- Simplicity and, subject to proper money management, reliability.

- The ability to adapt to your strategy.

- May be in addition to your trading method.

- Versatility - any pairs, any timeframe.

- Clean charts.

FCP disadvantages:

- Requires some trading experience, not suitable for absolute beginners.

- MT4 is not the best software for graphical constructions.

- You can not immediately take and use.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few words of introduction to clarify.

Everything that I will give here will be absolutely free. And I hope that from your side there will be no requests for private educations. I do not do it. I have enough of my trade and those small pips that I receive every day. As you know, I don’t need to prove anything to anyone. Ask everything you want to know here, let it be useful for other participants in the thread.

I will not give screenshots of my account or statistics of my trade to convince you (this is my business and my private territory). If you are competent, you will understand the essence and potential of the method without this. You will need only examples of charts and deals. You will find them in my profile. I will also post charts with examples of FCP here.

I also have the right not to disclose absolutely everything to you, I owe nothing to anyone other than thanking those people who helped me and from whom I studied at one time. Consider me returning my moral duty.

You may ask why I give you for free what brings me money... First, the money is brought not by the system itself, but by experience and knowledge. Secondly, it is not completely free. You will pay for it with your diligence, discipline and hours of training in front of your monitor. He, who is ready to make an effort, will receive the result. At its core, the FCP system is simple, but it is impossible to explain it right away (I think it’s even harmful), so be patient and you will succeed. I will explain FCP gradually and over time (or maybe very quickly) you will understand everything.

In this thread we discuss only FCP. I think you know how to behave so that everyone is comfortable and the thread is useful for its participants.

I hope this thread will become a place of communication for fans of this system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with TL and Fibonacci levels. At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, breaking out of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width. We will start with the FIBO projection from the diagonal channel, built from the trend line, since this is the basis. In the FCP, for TL we will use the Sperandeo method (Trader Vic).

On the example of uptrend.

Find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak). Draw a beam from this point to the left. The first bottom that touches line the will be the second point. You got our trend line. Build the channel so that one of the sides coincides with the TL. Usually we get point 3 by placing a max (min) swing on the midline of the channel, but the best place for the point 3 would be a straight continuous movement as far as possible from point 1 or point 2. Measure the vertical width of the channel and build a FIBO grid equal to this width. When the price leaves the channel, place the FIBO grid so that the line 1.000 passes through the breakdown point of the TL. Lines 0.382 and 0.000 will correspond to our TP. Look for an entry after closing the signal candle at 1.000. SL is usually a few points above the level of 1.000 or extension 1.272.

My daily trading consists more of scalping on m5 or m1. However, I do not recommend starting with a timeframe below 1 hour until you have mastered the system well enough.

could you please explain how you choose the other side  of the channel, why not on the extremes mark with arrows ?

thank you

--- 帖子 #7 ---
or the High between the two anchor points, which would be the 'classic' way of drawing channels.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Pay attention to this High. I placed it on the midline of the channel. This combination is of primary importance in the construction of the channel. In this case, we see a weak channel, from which we should not expect good projection, plus the Lon&NY sessions are already closed. Nevertheless, TP1 reached +35 points.

Hello ! Pretty interesting thread , made me remenber of Andrew Pitchfork , it graphically would be the same of using it with the fib levels on the channel it makes? the specification for the pivot points used on the AP would be the same of that of the fibo channel?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Great thread, Sei!

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I did not study the AP in detail, but it seems to me that this is not so...

But, you can try to build FIBO projections from a channel built using the AP.

Maybe it will work, I do not know ...

Fresh example of FСP.

I closed this scalp just with +30p. A good example of another rule for building a channel. If the price goes up (down) from point 1 or 2 with a single impulse and does not roll back, we place point 3 (the second side of the channel) at the place where it stops.

tnx in advance.

A very interesting method. Sometimes I really don't understand building a channel ..I would like to ask you why you don't have point three as I marked?

Thank you. And continue your work...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
The construction of the FCP channel is largely subjective. There is no clear algorithm. And I like it, there is an element of creativity. There are a few of simple rules. In fact, it is not difficult, you just need experience. You need to practice a little and you will see the channel only after seeing the chart.

1) Place the last High (for the uptrend) or Low (for the downtrend) on the midline of the channel. In this case, the second side of the channel will be built automatically. It will not necessarily be the closest to TL High or Low.

2) If the price rises (falls) from point 1 or 2 (TL construction points) with one impulse and does not roll back, we place point 3 (the second side of the channel) at the place where the price starts to roll back. Examples of this in my previous post.

3) If there is no combination of High or Low with the middle line, and also no strong continuous movement from points 1 and 2, in this case, draw the second side of the channel through the point at which the price starts to roll back after rising (or dropping during downtrend) from the point 2.

4) Ideal channel: A strong impulse from point 1 or 2 gives point 3, while the swing top is on a connecting line. Such an installation is rare, but it gives a good projection when the price exits the channel.

5) When you built the channel, check it: the price swings inside the channel should be combined with the internal lines of the channel (25%, 50% and 75%).

Try to carefully read what I write and carefully analyze the charts with examples, and of course you need to train. Part of my work day is testing. I'm just doing many back-tests of the FCP.

You are right, after an impulse I always draw a line through the point of its end. I wrote about this above. Otherwise, the projection may not be accurate.

Hi Seysin32, thanks for sharing your interesting idea ...

Would you please Let me know if channel and Fibonacci plotted correctly?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hello!

Yes, the channel and Fibo levels you have built correctly. We need one more Fibo level 0.750-0.786. These are two lines, but we will consider it one level. In the projection we have two trigger levels, these are 1.000 and 0.750-0.786. We will enter the deal at these levels. Later I will tell you by what criteria we will determine the entrance. On the chart, I showed the ideal ratio of channel lines, price swing and Fibo projection. This is what I wrote about before. Hope this clarifies. Give it a try.

Hi. It is that correct?

Please, can you put examples when the price is in a downtrendup ?

Thanks for your colaboration

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hello.

All right. Just need to fix some details. Show the middle line of the channel.

Fibo level 1.000 (trigger 1) we place at the place where the candle body exits the channel.

Raise the levels a few pips up. One more thing. To enter, I do not see a beautiful signal candle.

You need to look at the situation in the context of higher time frames.

Hi. Thanks Seysin32 realy cool stuff.

Just a short question, if dump please ignore and sorry than.

Would it be possible to measure simple the distance of the trendlinebreak to the last high/low and take this value for TP? Measured with fibs? Without channel?

Regards and nice WE,

Klausi

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Mr Seysin. In the last example is not clear for me the inclination of the fibo channel. Can you identificate the 3 dots, please ?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
In the first post, I wrote about the main idea of the FCP: after the breakdown of the channel, the price travels a distance equal to its width. How to determine its width, if you do not build a channel? After all, the outer side of the channel is not always the high/low. Also, the middle line does not always go through the high/low. Sometimes the external side of the channel (and hence its width) is determined by the size of the first swing pulse at point 2. I also wrote about this. Nevertheless, I think that it is possible to build projections using only TL and levels Fibo. But for this you will have many settings for each case of price behavior. It is much easier to draw 2 parallel lines in a few seconds and two mouse clicks.

Unfortunately, in this example, part of the channel is not shown in the screenshot. There will be many more examples ahead, don’t worry. We will disassemble everything as questions arise.

Dear Seysin32,

Thank you for sharing this method. I always like to use Fibo but as price changes, i was often confused by it's application. I wish to learn from you... attached herewith GJ, did I draw it correctly?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
No, not right.

1. Start with H1 charts. While you learn.

2. Where are the levels of 0.750-0.785?

3. Carefully read the description in previous posts on how to build TL.

I made a model for you on my chart. Chances to reach TP 50/50. Additional signals needed.

Hello Seysin32, I like your system and I would like to apply it in the best way. I have to tell him that I understand the mechanics and how it is applied, but in order to start it, the first thing I need to know is the "channel", I explain:

That channel, which indicator is it? or how is it built ?. I use metatrader4, does my indicator exist on my platform?

If I could solve this problem, for me it would be easier to follow the system, because as I say I already understand the mechanics

Hello, sorry if I'm bother you, can you mark point 3 in your picture?

Here should be your answer'

Thanks a lot Mr. Seysin32

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi

For MetaTrader4 users,

I think

the " Fibo Channel " with modified levels,

is the best for drawing the channel.

The regular fibo channel in MT4 is not an equal distance channel.

By changing the default setting ( as I show in the image ), we can make the equidistant channel with 5 lines ( the regular fibo channel has 6 lines ) for using in this system.

This fibo channel does not have any relation with fibo levels , which we have to use in next step of the system.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Gracias

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Dear Seysin, thank you very much for working out this model, i re-learn and understand much more.

I use fractal to find the bottoms and this system will help in avoiding the fake out signal. As we follow the price movement, we tends to jump into trade too early, FOMO. This system provide clear guidance & we can set standing orders, really set & forget.

Please let me know if my understanding is correct.

1st chart: when the price cross below the channel, we may enter sell limit at Fibo level 0.786; However, when the price move back into the channel, this signal is invalid and we got to hunt for the next setup.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

2nd chart: when the price cross below the channel, our setup of standing order entry-TP is perfect! (we could use candle cross Fibo levels to extend our TP beyond 0.382). This is RR of 1:6 !!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks. You showed and explained correctly. I do not use MT4 for graphical constructions, only to open positions on one of my accounts. But, I think this is not a problem, and you showed it.

Exactly!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Your channel is built incorrectly, which means everything else too. Once again, re-read all my posts about FCP constructions and carefully study all the examples (so far there are not many). In the future, you can use additional indicators to confirm the entry. But we have not yet considered anything but the construction of the channel and the TL. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you and everyone here train to build a TL and a channel. Just rewind the chart six months ago and draw, draw and draw. In the next stages, we will consider what precedes the breakdown of the channel, the behavior of the price after the breakdown, the correct location of the Fibo levels, trigger levels and the opening of a position. I think I blabbed too much, no?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Friends, here is an example of FСP setups from start to finish. This is an example of ideal setups about which I wrote in this post.

Such setups are rare, but they have a fairly high probability of a model triggering. In this example, the deal brought 90 pips or so.

You created the TL correctly. But the channel is weak, usually I do not trade such.

The middle line is free and the second side of the channel is also free, i.e. point 3 is missing.

Please read a few posts above, where I show on the chart the construction of the TL step by step. Here is how I would build a channel in this case. But, I have already said that I do not like him. I regard the chances of performing the Fibo projection as very low. Maximum 50/50. Maybe the price will make a correction and reach our TP. Or maybe the trend will continue. If in doubt, it is better to refrain from trading and switch to another pair. Swings inside the channel, points 1, 2, 3 must be such that they scream. I hope you understand, we must immediately see and understand them, this is what we need. If in doubt, it is better to look for another setting.

Friends, since you are asking me, let me give you advice. These are simple things and you have heard it many times, or you yourself have said it to others. Do not try to apply this to live trading now. Testing old charts. Then you can make one movement with the mouse to the left side and immediately check the correctness of your FCP setups. Price will tell you that.

A weak channel does not mean a weak trend. You need to pay attention to the swings inside the channel, the price movement at points 1 and 2, and yes, you are right, the width of the channel. That is, look at everything together. There are still important factors, but about them later.

Rule for trade FCP (for live trading in the future). Build a TL. Do not build the channel, but wait for the breakdown of the TL.

If the price makes new High/Low, rebuild the TL. If it breaks through the TL, draw a channel and check it. It's simple.

Friends, tomorrow I have a weekend.

Do not worry if I do not answer. If you have time, practice the graphical construction of the FCP.

I wish everyone a good rest. In this difficult time, take care of yourself and your family.

See you on Monday.

good morning,

looking at the uptrend chart in ur post #1 and assuming #1 & #2 on the TL are shown on this chart.......then for the life of me I cannot see where the #3 position would be after studying your construction criteria in post #19..

there appears no point of contact with the mid-channel and no single impulse from either #1 or #2.

maybe Im getting too old..

Hello.

Thanks for the nice question. It's amazing that only you noticed it. You are right, I showed an atypical case. However, you will understand, it is not difficult. You are not getting old . Look at the first chart. We had TL1. Then it was canceled when the price went up a little higher. Then we drew TL2. However, we see that the price has not gone far, and kept the area that I circled in yellow.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Having received TL2, we had a choice: option number 1.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Or option number 2.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In both cases, we got our projection and TP. But these two options did not take into account that we previously had TL1, after which the area encircled by me retained its strength. Then we expand the channel so that it includes the ascending region TL1 (just to check). And we see that the price precisely interacts with the channel lines, and the maximum is exactly on the 25% line.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So, you are right. A more accurate option is option number 2. But, as I wrote earlier, there is an element of subjectivity here that allows you to see a little wider, and ultimately get more freedom in assessing the situation.

Hello, my friend.

1. CADCHF

The FСP model is built correctly. What should be done.

First, remove the Fibo level of 0.893. Our trigger levels are 1.000 and 0.786-0.750.

Secondly, look at the higher timeframes, to see if trigger prices in the past are S/R levels.

The third. We will not open positions only on the breakdown of TL (this is another rule of the FCP). We will wait for the rollback to trigger levels and the rejection of the test. Check out the examples on the charts that I have already posted.

Hello everyone.

Fresh example. This is happening now. Do not pay attention to the time frame, we are only interested in the FСP model.

In this situation, you can build a channel in two ways. And while there is no development of the situation and additional signals, we cannot say for sure which option is correct. Therefore, I built 2 options at once on two charts. The first chart - channel is built on the movement from point 2, the second chart - channel is built on the midline. Let's look at the further development of the model.

You need to see how the price will respond to the trigger 0.750-0.786. Look at the rejection of test at this level, look at additional signals. For example, on a candlestick model. In any case, having reached TP1, we either fix part of the profit or moved SL to breakeven.

Fibonacci channels are highly subjective. The trader chooses three points they deem to be significant, yet the market may not view these points as significant and thus may not respect or react as expected to the drawn levels. On the contrary, Andrew's Pitchfork lines are based on ABC patterns easier to identify and more reliable.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
You are right, in the FCP is an element of subjectivity. However, not much more than in another method. The FCP has clear criteria for constructing channels and projections. However, how you apply these rules is up to you. Since you have not studied FCP in depth, you draw hasty conclusions. As I wrote earlier, this is a simple, reliable and with sufficient experience effective system. This is easy to verify. Even considering that up to this time I have described only the main elements of the FCP , without mentioning the important details.

The model worked well. Some difficulty due to the fact that the retest was already too high.

I think it was not too late. It all depends on how many pips you are going to receive.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
That's the point, it takes 3 seconds to see the pitchfork in the above image: median line starting at 2, upper and lower trigger lines at 1 and 3 (lower low).

There is not need to study in-depth to get the same outcome. Anyway, I was only giving another option that should still work with your system.

--- 帖子 #108 ---

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks. I see, that price responds to projection levels, is good. But your projection does not start at the channel breakdown? In that case, what are the entry criteria and where are the trigger lines? Please do the same on the EUR/USDl H1 chart like below, I just want to compare.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Ok, I tried it myself. Two main questions.

1. What is the width of the projection (1.000-0.000)?

2. Where do we place the trigger line 1.000?

All in all, yes, I see that it works, maybe not so accurately, as FCP.

Due to an earlier entry, there may be more triggering of the SL. Need to testing.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
The trigger is the actual trigger line, first one is the black arrow but it pulls back second is the red arrow and confirm entry with red line.

That's it, you don't need anything else. The fib extension based on the PF swing is only for TP

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Now it is clear. It's not that simple, my friend. What will you do in most cases when the price does not test TL at all after a breakdown? The projection width by swing size is a small target. For a more accurate TP goal, it needs to be doubled. Yes, this topic has already been raised in the threads of Real Trading, in the end I was left with my own way. In this topic, more than 400 charts with examples of my live transactions based on the FCP, you can see there a good accuracy. And yet, I ask you to make a projection on the euro chart H1 in the very place to compare.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
The main idea of the FCP: the width of the projection is equal to the width of the broken channel. This is a classic graphical analysis.

If you try to use the AP - ok, but we get a completely different system. It may be easier to build, but I have not yet been convinced

that it is works better. Therefore, we return to the Fibo projections based on the channel width.

The question is closed.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Somehow I see some similarity with Tom Demark trend line trading.

The difference is his is using the highest/lowest fractal to the trend line as a projection of target.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Friends, let's continue. So, the FSP itself is a graphical model. She is simple. The presence of the model itself is not a guarantee of its work. We need an "advantage" (if you don’t know what I mean, ask). Advantage depends on the method and conditions of application of the model, and it depends on the filling of the model with signals. You can use those signals (indicators of superiority) that you usually use, in which you are well versed. And this is the universality of the FCP. I will tell you what elements I use:

1. Candles breakdown TL.

The candle, preceding the candle, a candle breaking TL should be the opposite. A candle breaking TL, or following, it should be accompanied by an increase in volume.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

2. Graphic models of swing, before the breakdown of TL.

These are well-known price models; there are threads on the FF dedicated to them. I draw attention to the fact that point 3 in these models coincides with the middle line of the our channel (that is, with point No. 3 of the FCP model). If we find these models in the channel before its breakdown, it also increases our advantage.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

3. Fibo extension levels.

If the swing maximum/minimum coincides with the extension 1.272 (or 1.618) of the Fibo grid, this also significantly increases the advantage.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

These are not mandatory, but desirable conditions. The presence of these signals gives our model a great advantage in the direction of execution.

I will write about the signals after the breakdown later.

Yes.

The price movement on chart 2 is still inside the wider price movement shown on chart 1.

We can consider chart 2 as finding the best price to enter chart 1. This is the theory.

But in this case, I would be aloof. I like to see a position right away and not look for it.

IMHO.

Just a suggestion that maybe you can expound on point 3 in post 1. Point 1 and 2 would be quite easy.

What I know now is that point 3 can be either to the right of point 1 or in between point 1 and 2.

A better point 3 would be a straight continuous movement as far as possible from point 1 or point 2.

Sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question correctly. From point 1 to point 3, the price can go as a single impulse without rollbacks. Or maybe do rollbacks. In this case, there are no rollbacks. I usually start to evaluate the model only after closing the candle behind the TL line.

Friends, let's continue. A few words about the interaction of prices with TL. If the price breakdown through the TL and then returned back, but did not make a new maximum (minimum), we move the FIBO lines 1.000 (trigger line) to the candle whose body has broken through the channel again. In this case, we do not take into account shadows, it is the body that is important. See examples on charts:

Hi

Thank you indeed;

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Just want to encourage those who really intend to learn this FCP method of trading.

We as individuals learn at different pace due to our own trading experiences.

These experiences nobody can help you, you have to seek your own.

There is no short cut, unless you are willing to pay for a mentor which can be costly.

So do not be discouraged if you don't get it the first few times.

Today I've read post 1 the fourth time.

I remember when I was a newbie I have to read a particular method 10 times.

3 times in the morning, 3 times in the afternoon, 3 times at night.

Then the 10th time the next day to see whether the method is suited to my style of trading.

My personal opinion on Highlights from post 1.

"At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, breaking out of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width."

So this is a break out method. Not just any break out.

Use it with the main trend then this becomes a break out after a retracement.

The target being a Fib projection based on the channel width.

Hope that you can see the big picture now.

---> Trend trading on retracement break out with entry, stop loss and target.

What more can you ask?

Hello everyone!

Firstly I want to thank Inthebox for a good post. Really, what more can you ask?

Now a little theory on the example of the current situation with the EUR/USD. In fact, I did not want to talk about this until I gave a full explanation of the basics of the FCP. I think this is not a problem. After yesterday's movement, the price formed a small horizontal channel. Personally, I am not a supporter of trading inside the horizontal channel. I want to see a breakthrough in one direction or another. But this is a matter of your preference. Check out the charts below:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You may ask, why not draw simple parallel lines above the maximum? Answer: with the right scenario, the maximum probability is the achievement of TP1, the higher the lower the probability. Also, if we use Fibo lines, we get an important trigger level of 0.750-0.786. See more chart examples below:

do not like your point 3 as there were many jagged retraces from your point 1 to 3.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
the purpose of point 3 is to measure the width of the channel, which will affect the width of fibonacci 0 to 100, which will after the target.

from post 1.

"Usually we get point 3 by placing a max (min) swing on the midline of the channel, but the best place for the point 3 would be a straight continuous movement as far as possible from point 1 or point 2."

i prefer point 3 drawn from point 2 from this example in my chart, in which case the other end of the channel is used.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Friends, any system is not good in itself. And FСP too. I used to write about the advantage that we must find for the model to work. But the biggest advantage is you yourself. You have to become them. If this is not the case, even the best system will bring only losses. Therefore, I do not believe in indicators, I do not believe in ideal systems or the holy grail. I believe in smart people and their experience. This is an advantage.

If I ever hear that said me a more experienced trader, I tried to cling to every word: what he said, what it is, I want to know this. If i didn't know that, I was looking for information,  I spent many hours, days, and weeks to find out and try it. Then I either kept it to myself or discarded it.

I say banal things, but can’t say otherwise. There are only 11 pages in our thread now. If you cannot read them carefully, think and understand simple things, then trading may not be for you... I hope this is not so.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Okay, let's continue.

So, we have a channel and a Fibo projection of its width. The fact that the price has broken the channel is not a reason to open a deal. We must look for a situation, where the price rolls back to trigger levels (1.000 or 0.750-0.768) and cannot overcome them. It may look like a pin-bar, doji Heikin-Ashi, candelstick model, failure swing pattern (by Tom Dante) or any reversal signal that you use in your trading system. I always wait for a signal at trigger levels and if it is not there, I will not take a deal, even if the price then rises or falls. What else does it give? Small SL and opening at a good price. On most of my charts here you will see signals to enter at trigger levels. Do not rush if the candle touches the trigger line, wait for the next candle, it is a signal candle for entry. Below are a few "bad" charts. You see that entering too early without a signal candle would be a mistake.

Hi All,

This is for anyone who is using MT4 and wants to get the Fibo Channel tool settings right.

1. Draw out the Fibo Channel tool on your chat.

2. Go to the properties of the Fibo Channel tool and use the parameters below...Common : Change the Style setting to a colour that fits your background (I use Red) Fibo Levels : Use levels -0.25, -0.5,-0.75. Change the style color as needed (I use Blue) and I use the dashed line. That is all that is need to use the tool in MT4. Hope it is useful for someone.

--- 帖子 #221 ---

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hello.

I open a deal at the trigger level 1 or 2 (1.000 or 0.750-0.786).

When the price reaches TP1 (0.382), I close part of the position, usually 1/3, and move SL to the BE for the rest part.

When the price reaches TP2, I close one more part, and allow the rest to grow. If I opened at trigger level 1, and then get another signal at trigger 2, I can add.

I prefer to take profits and decline losses, I feel so comfortable, but you can do otherwise. It all depends on what timeframe you are working on and what profit will satisfy you. If on H1 and above, you can increase the position gradually.

Hi @Seysin32,

Thank you for your guidance. I am trying to figure out what has gone wrong with my charting. Is it because of the new low (Point 3)?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
generally speaking, i think majority of the time ......

if point 3 appears after point 1 -> use FCP mid line.

if point 3 appears after point 2 -> use FCP outer line.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi @Inthebox,

Thanks for sharing as well. In addition, I am thinking point 3 might due to the use of Sperandeo method to draw trend lines. Perhaps @Seysin32 could guide us further.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
The Sperandeo method means that after price had broken the FCP channel, it retraces back to fib 100 or 75/78.6 for entry.

--- 帖子 #264 ---

--- 帖子 #265 ---
The rules for constructing a TL, channel and choosing point 3 are quite simple. Follow them and the price will "respect" the lines of your projection with amazing accuracy. However, as with everything else, practice is needed. Trainings more on the old charts, you can always check your FСP and see where you made a mistake.

Important note. Always consider your FСP model in the context of other information - other signals, S/R levels on higher timeframes, etc. The only way. In this case, you will not have confusion in your head. If you are working on the m5 chart, open the H1 chart, see if there is a model of the FCP there? What will you do - look for a Buy or Sell? When everything is clear, go back to m5 and build the FCP model in the right direction. For example, some time ago I published a deal in which I was looking for an entry point for H1 at the levels TP1/TP2 m5.

So friends, let's continue.

This is the final part of the description of the FCP model, which does not prevent you from improving it in the future. I spoke earlier about the elements (additional signals) that create an advantage in our model towards its success. Two more such elements that are MA and MACD. With MACD, everything is simple. I am looking for divergences or hidden divergences at the maximum/minimum inside the channel, or on the trigger lines. For MA - I’m looking for the intersection of two lines, and if it is on the trigger line, this is ideal. Also, the MA lines for me are the final argument in deciding to open a deal. The rule: is to always look for a deal in the direction from the pink dashed line MA to the yellow dashed line MA. Even if you have the perfect channel and projection, if the MA lines are not crossed in the direction of the deal, the price may go against you. Below are some examples with explanations and settings for MA + MACD.

au. if your point 3 is at outer fcp, then the point 2 to point 3 is jagged - should be smooth as far as possible.

if your point 3 is after point 1, use fcp mid line.

if your point 3 is before point 1, use fcp outer line.

general guide only. all depends on how wide you want your fcp which will affect your fib targets.

compare ....

uc. tp1 and 2 achieved with horizontal fcp.

price broke out of consolidation with lower high lower low, so no buying.

multiple opportunities to sell at fib 100.

even if want to buy, still can achieve tp1 profit with smaller time frame.

knowing that one is trading counter trend.

Hello Seysin.

Nice thread you have opened here. Basically just price action and psychology. I have only read half the pages and I'm trying to learn how to draw the correct lines. Does this one make sense? 1st target has been reached and stop would be at b/e by now. I did take that trade live (on demo) but after that strong retracement, I decided to get out with a few pips, also because I didn't want to leave it open overnight. Big mistake!  I suppose patience is the key...

Guys, I missed this one. I had set up my order at the 1 level but it didn't retrace far enough. I'm still a bit confused about entries. Maybe on 5min it requires quicker entries? Or probably if the momentum is strong it would be worth to anticipate at the 0.78?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
careful. there may be a bounce after break out of trend line.

look at higher time frame first to see big picture.

for small time frame, you may want to divide your intended lots by 2 entries.

sorry for flooding the thread. Just seeing setups everywhere, hopefully agreeing with rules and higher TFs. Opinions about this? It broke out my channel and then reentered inside, to then break out again

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Yes, they could, since the price crossed the TL many times, but did not make a new maximum. But I would not take such a model. I love beautiful setups. And if I don’t see it, I’m not looking for it on purpose. Look a little wider on my chart.

ok but the biggest issue i have now is that some trades end up hitting the SL because it breaks the TL, I enter, and then it goes back towards the SL and hits it

how do we filter out false breakouts of the TL??

--- 帖子 #365 ---
what time frame do you trade?

smaller time frames you find more set ups and SL will be hit more often.

experiment yourself.

if you like trading in smaller time frame, not necessarily to use fib 127.2 as SL.

use the previous one fractal away or two away. experiment.

if you find SL has been hit often but later price end up going in the original direction, you can even consider the other end of the channel.

that is, provided you got the higher time frame trend right.

or else try m30 and above.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
spotted late after having my lunch.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
So friends. Since the questions from the participants are repeated the same, let me repeat the answers to them.

First of all. Take the time to carefully study the information from post#1.

What are the findings to get started?

1. If you are new to trading, FСP is not for you yet. Do not think that just by reading the description of the method, you will immediately become a successful trader. Learn the basics: market structure and participants, supply and demand, price action, S/R levels, candles, etc. Only then FСP.

2. Start mastering the FСP by testing on old charts. It will not cost you anything. But it will give a lot. Believe me. This is a good training. You can always see your mistakes right away, just by moving the chart to the left. Over time, you will see the projection only by looking at the chart. Having sufficient experience in the FCP, I devote a lot of free time to testing on old charts. I like it.

If you started.

1. If we built the model correctly, the price will “respect” the lines of projection with amazing accuracy. It starts with trigger levels. If this does not happen, I know that I built the model incorrectly. And then I'm looking for an mistake in the TL or in the channel. If the model is controversial, or I doubt it, I am looking for opportunities on other pairs. Good setups are visible right away.

2. If you look at all successful FCP models in retrospect, you will see, that signal candles did not break much trigger levels. This means that SL can be very small. In this case, if you make a mistake three times, you will lose a little, but for the fourth time you will recover the losses and also earn more.

What else to say... I do not know. He who has eyes, let him see.

I am grateful to all the participants who bring useful points to the strategy of using the FCP, while preserving the model itself.

I wish everyone to enjoy your trading. Take care of yourself and loved ones.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi @Seysin32

Just found your thread and going through all the posts. I love this method. I used to trade a 2 channel intersect (4H and 1H) a while back.

Looking for setups on M5 just for practise.

Can you let me know if I've drawn this correct? This is a GJ M5 chart

Also another question in how to draw your channels (bullish/bearish).  Coz sometimes the Daily/H4 may give you one direction and the ltf may be showing another.

Thanks again, and look forward to seeing good results from your method.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hello.

The answer is here post#381
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #379 ---
thanks @Seysin32. I have gone through your Gold analysis and it makes sense.

For my charts (GJ), the issue i'm having is that I see it's bearish on the htf (eg D/H4 etc).

So even though I've drawn a bearish channel (expecting a bullish trade), that would be counter-trend trading and a little risky imo.

That's why I drew the recent bullish channel (for the Short trade) so I can follow the trend.

1) When you say the channel is not needed, I'm a bit confused.  What if I hadn't drawn the bearish channel (that you said is "ok")?

Would the other channel be valid then?

2) Currently on GJ M5 I'm in a SHORT (but you said channel is not needed, so does this mean it's a bad trade?

3) Please help me clear the confusion:

What is the 1st step?  Do we look at the D/H4 to get the overall direction and then draw the appropriate channel on lft that will align with that htf direction?

I'm sorry if I'm not making myself clear. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say, and where I'm getting 'stuck'.

Again, many thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
The puzzle came together connected its system and seysin32 and it looks like the Grail. The entries were 100% All health and good luck!!!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Serqew, nice trade. What oscillator are you using?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Imagine that the price moves inside the channel at htf. We have three options.

1. We are waiting for a pullback and enter in the direction of the trend. We are looking for the exact entry point at ltf, having built the FСP there.

And, as you know, you can trade the pullback itself too. I gave an example in a previous post (oil chart).

2. Expect breakdown of high/low. We considered (example1, 2) the option of constructing this model in a thread.

3. Do nothing, but just wait for the price to exit the channel. As soon as the price has left the channel and we have received confirmation of this,

we are looking for a place to enter at the best price.

In your case:

If the price exited the channel up (against the trend), the projection would show you where you can enter in the direction of the trend - at TP1 and TP2,

the impulse usually weakens (example here).

PS. Do not forget that today is Friday.

Point 3 is placed on the outer side of the channel, if from point 1 or 2 (or from 1 and 2 together) there is an impulsive price movement without rollbacks. It is desirable candles with a large body (relative to other candles). Preference to the impulse from point 1. In other cases, point 3 is on the midline. It is not complicated, and there is also an easy way to check. I always check the channel looking at how the price reacts to trigger levels. If price does not pay attention them, then I rebuild the channel (put 3 points in another place). The ideal option is described in post#23.

Here is a case that is not common: There is no momentum from point 1 or 2, the swing max/min is so small that if we place it on the middle line, we get a channel with a width of pencil. Place point 3 on the 25% line of the channel. If the external side of the channel (before or in the area of point 2) and the price go in different directions, decrease or increase the channel so that they are directed in the same direction.

The problem for many beginners (I do not mean anyone here specifically) is that they do not want to think and evaluate the situation in context. To consider a combination of factors. They want a mechanism that works itself, always and accurately, like a robot. I remember a case when fake news appeared on Google and robots trading in the news caused huge losses

As I said before, the element of subjectivity is not in the interpretation of principles, but in their application. The conviction of sellers and buyers, fear or greed, all this is also subjectivity. Subjectivity drives markets. I think it's great. This is a creative opportunity that is rewarded with money. I get pleasure from it.

Find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak). Draw a beam from this point to the left. ....

i guess it's alright with point 3 at fcp mid line after point 1.

but i would like to ask seysin comparing the 2 charts which one he prefers.

the notion is from post 14. point 3 at fcp outer line after point 1.

my reasons are:

1. point 3 is the lowest low.

2. there are 2 price touches reactions at the fcp quartile line.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Same as what I have. Your candle color though may confuse you later. Should be green for bullish, red for bearish.

Hello, friends!

This is just my opinion, you should work yours head.

1. Context.

Where are we. You see on chart#1 that we are inside a big movement "А". Аll subsequent swings are decreasing. This means that channel projections are also decreasing. Conclusion - we make small projections with small TP. Before the price breaks the figure, it can go out and come back. Until the figure is broken and we receive confirmation of this, be careful.

2. The build of the channel.

So, we have 2 options for the 3rd point. Why do I choose chart#2:

a) On chart#4 (the 3rd point on the midline) we see, that the price ignore trigger line#2. On chart#3 (the 3rd point is on the outer side of the channel) we see, how the price reacts to trigger#2 (and to other projection lines quite accurately). Also, as Inthebox said, in this case, the price takes into consideration the internal lines of the channel.

b) Continuous movement from point 2 is interrupted by a small rollback. This is not critical and in another case we can ignore it, but here it is in favor of chart#2. And as we can see, this also coincides with the outer side of the channel.

3. Action plan.

Considering what was said in paragraph 1, and the fact that we have a narrow channel with a small projection. It’s also that MA lines diverge and while we are on the sales side. In the case of receiving a long setup on m5, I will enter with a small SL and with TP in the area of the upper MA line.

4. I am not a supporter of catching turns at the most extreme point. I will enter later, when I see confirmation. In doing so, I will earn less. But, I don’t need much, even 15-20 points will be enough for me.

Hello Isabella and welcome!

I am not sure that I have the right quotes, my candles look different. However, I would build the channel and projection as on my chart. You need to wait for the development of the model and confirmation signals. If your trading style allows, go down to H4 or H1, there are more trading opportunities for training in FСP.

A pleasant tone that you maintain here @Seysin.

On monday / tuesday i will have time to try out current market time frames as you suggested. I prefer M30-W1, so a actually search should be worthwhile in the next week. Let's see if I can do the technical craft in the chart.

Your channels have 5 lines. Would you also accept 3 lines, especially in higher tf? Or does this view destroy your concept.

Inthebox, thank you for your critique. That final fib 100 was placed incorrectly. It seems to have gotten moved during my chart cleanup for presentation.

In reviewing your comments, I saw that the very first channel on my chart was too wide. By changing the channel boundaries, using the lower time frames, as you suggested, I was able to create a little more opportunity for acting on the first FCP.

The Eur/Usd chart was originally presented by Chrisjia in a request for review.

Your USD/CAD trade post was very helpful.  While examining it, I saw a different trade to analyze within the chart.

This trade starts on Friday 4/17 at 4am with a sharp decline that lasts through the rest of the trading day. I have drawn a simple channel to show the setup. The market closes just as the price crosses the TL. On Sunday , The price crosses Fib 100 signalling a long entry.

Hello!

Perhaps this is correct. I am not sure about this situation, my quotes are slightly different. That's what I think. On H1, a small channel, inside weak swings, looks so-so... To clarify the situation and get a better place to enter, we go down to m5 (we only need trigger line 1 and 2). On m5, everything is much better, and you see a good setup for entering. I showed on the chart.

Unfortunately I can’t, my platform does not support third-party indicators. Just compare the charts.

I think that it is impossible to create an indicator for the FСP. But it is possible for some of its elements. Maybe I'm wrong...

Why not learn and use the simple rules for constructing channels, it's easy. It’s much harder to create indicators

really appreciated it any comments

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Did you enter the trade after the pullback to 100? or right away during the break out?

i have my intended trade unit divided by 3 so that one can be at break out, one on pullback, the third one as i see fit.

this is my own preference. the first one is like a scout out to test, the rests when the movement becomes clearer.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Kvak,

if i see your gold trade, if we entered during the first 3 candles after breakout, we will lost the trade and hit the SL, while on those 3 first candles seems like the bottom wick clearly showing the rejection around that area.

how do you think, we can pass those 3 first candles and wait? should we always in this case, wait until it reach again the trigger 0.782 area?

any thought?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
nice MM then, so we could manage lesser loss when the price against our prediction.

could you comment on my trade? is it due to no confirmation of the candle to entry?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
the main thing i would advise is do not trade usd vs cad in asia session.

trade jpy or aud or nzd (asian currencies) vs eur or gbp or maybe usd.

so i expect less movement and therefore would lessen the width of fcp channel.

Hello everyone!

I very rarely enter without the 1.000 test. I do this in the case, when the price crosses the TL many times back and forth, but does not make a new min/max.

In this example I did not enter at trigger1. So as soon as the price touched trigger 2, I entered, by this time the MA lines crossed.

Chart below:

Three candles closed under Trigger line1. There is no signal candle. You can’t enter.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Thanks Seysin,

noted:

rarely enter the 1.000 (at first I bet) because it is too risky the price might trying to break the channel, and more of it if it try touching multiple time to break the channel.

Of course after sometime when it pullback again to 1.000 it might be better to enter as long as we have the trigger candle

Thanks for your insight.

the trigger candle you mean here usually a pinbar, double top/bottom, or bullish/bearish engulfing?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hi Seysin,

this trade interest me,

what is triggering you to enter here, as it have not a pullback to the trigger line? solely due to the bullish candle of it that pierce right to the 0.782 area?

--- 帖子 #504 ---
You are right, I more often enter from Trigger 2 (zone 0.75-0.786), than Trigger 1. If it is not a scalp, but a deal on Н1 and higher, on Trigger 1 I open only part of the position, on Trigger 2 one more part (approximately, like Inthebox does).

Yes, all that you described. Just choose what works best for you.

I think, drawing a channel is not the first thing, you need a Trendline first, when price breaks the line, the you create your channel.

I advice you go read post 1.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Yep. I agree with you.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
compare the h1 chart.

if you are using retracement for entry, go to m5 at the point of yellow dotted vertical line.

in m5 you use the same fcp method to refine your entry.

so your fcp has to be downward sloping, not an upward one.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
In all honesty, this is a load of hogwash. You are trading a trend line  break using fibonacci to manage your money, it's not a strategy, it's a money management system.

Hi Seysin32. Thank you for your effort and sharing. Your video helps a lot.

I have tried to enter the live trading.

Do u think I get your idea?

Thanks and good pips.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
i assumed that you have read post 1 because this is the least basic thing to do before you start to make a comment in a thread.

from post 1.

"The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with TL and Fibonacci levels. At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, breaking out of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width. We will start with the FIBO projection from the diagonal channel, built from the trend line, since this is the basis."

you mean the above mention of using trend line is not clear enough in post 1?

using trend line break in higher time frame and upon retracement, using trend line break again in lower time frame is not a strategy by itself?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
That's exactly what I mean.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
so now you have come to agree that

1. mention of trend line break is very clear in post 1.

2. trend line break in both higher and lower time frame is by itself a strategy.

therefore going forward, kindly refrain from using such strong wordings as "a load of hogwash".

Actually, I notice that the TL can be drawn for more than one opportunity in the same chart.

Chart 1 is what I am in now.

Chart 2 is what I find another opportunity in the same chart.

Can I say that if the FCP is created correctly, then normally I can just focus on this FCP and ignore the other possible FCP?

i noticed that you are using h1.

do not force to draw fcp, it has to jump out quite clearly.

you intend to buy because the trend tells you so.

but h1 fcp does not jump out.

you will miss out a lot of things if you do not go down to lower time frame.

go down to m5/15 for more details to look for traces for an entry.

1. fcp jumps out in m15.

2. regular divergence in m15

3. higher high higher low in m5.

so chart 2 is better.

it's a matter of opinion. nothing more nothing less.

it's only your personal experience that your own method of application of trend lines failed you previously, leading you to form the opinion that trend lines are unreliable.

however, it's otherwise for me, strategy using trend lines as part of the arsenal is a successful one.

my explanation if i may add, is that your sell is a counter trend to higher time frame.

for counter trend is more risky, the fcp width has to be adjusted smaller.

however it is better to trade with the higher time frame trend

the h1 (with explanation) fcp and m15 fcp are shown with buy at yellow arrow onward.

trading smaller time frame by itself alone has not enough information to see the whole picture in context.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hi Seysin,

if this trade made by me, i will enter the trade much faster than you either during the pullback to 1.000 or after reaching 0.786 after pulling back to 1.000, i dunno what make you patiently wait that small pinbar that retrace to 0.786 line? i would think that train is long gone after its leaving the 0.786

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Dear Seysin an InTheBox,

when we make the channel after a breakout, when the price than after few candles, pullback to the channel with some of the candle body I know that mean the channel is cancelled. What about the candle wick that entering back to the channel, should we simply reposition the Fibo line only or this is also cancelling the channel?

--- 帖子 #564 ---
1.000 is a very weak level until it is confirmed. But often, when a signal candle appears, the price is already leaving too far from 1.000.

Then I wait for a pullback to 0.786-0.750 and enter there. This is more reliable.

+40p for one deal is enough for me

--- 帖子 #565 ---
i think it's better you show a chart on this.

sometimes when candle enter back to fcp, especially for short period of time, it does not mean that fcp need to be adjusted.

the original and adjusted fcp can be compared at the point of a followed up breakout point.

time and the depth of retrace play an important part.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
If the price returned to the channel, but did not make a new min/max, the channel is not rebuilt. Maybe it will look like a few candles on the TL, back and forth. We transfer the Fibo lines only at the intersection of the TL and the candle body (not the shadow), when the candle again leaves the channel, but does not make a new min/max before that. Maybe later I will find you an example chart.

Hi InTheBox & Seysin,

here is the graph i meant earlier, after the break a long wick piercing the channel (which is then I entered the trade after this candle), after that a group of candle entered the channel.  The MA crossing, few candles after I made my trade.

Divergen is there also in the channel. conclusion: after I got stop out then the trade went to TP 1, not my lucky day.

What i've made wrong?

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Stop loss hit with the way I applied the channel and Fibo, but when you arranged it, TP hits. Woot!

I need to work on the channel, point 1, 2 and 3.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
You are correct that trendlines are not reliable enough to use as a trading strategy. I have a long winded explanation of why I think that FCP should not be casually dismissed, if you are interested in reading along. I am not the spokes person here, but these comments reflect what I have learned.

NB: My brain is wired to think in terms of prices, not exchange rates. When I say prices, you should translate that to pips.

The Fibonacci Channel Projection describes a process that does use a trendline, but it is not a standard trendline that you would see in other systems. This process does not lead you to blindly make trades when the trendline is broken. Instead, this process starts with the identification of a large increase in price or a large decrease in price during a short period of time, after which prices has pulled back. For the purposes of my discussion, I will assume that the price is trending up and call the high price the apex.  The apex  is later used to form a channel.  Near the base of the chart where the large increase started, you locate a lower price that will become a point on the trendline which I'll call TL. Then, you look for a another low price point that occurs after the apex and created as part of the pull back. This point becomes the second point of TL  See Post 1 for the specific rule. Unlike standard trendlines, the trader gets to elect which 2 points are used. This may significantly affect the profitability of the trade. Seysin32 refers to this as the artistic part of the process.

Next, you a create a channel, using the two low points (forming the TL) and the apex point. Then measure the vertical distance from the TL to the apex side of the channel. Since the two channel lines are equi-distant you can measure any vertical points along the channel. You will later, use this distance to create the projection. I like to think of this distance as the measured move.

After the channel is created, you wait for price to break through the channel. It may be at or near the pullback point, or it may occur later in time and higher in price along the TL. At the point where the TL is broken, you draw a fibonacci retracement on the chart, placing the 1.0 fib line at the TL breakout. Measure down the chart a distance equal to the channel vertical distance (measured move) and place the 0.0 fib line there. The fib is used to project the measured move target for your trade.

I explained this based on higher trending prices. It works exactly in reverse for lower trending prices with a break to the upside.

Your job as a trader is to then use your own rules for entering the trade, so as to protect yourself from losses. You have a choice of taking profits at suggested triggers, or setting your own.

In my opinion, what makes the FCP system work is the careful selection of dramatic swings in the market, then collecting a measured amount of pips on the anticipated reversal.

Go to Post #1 and work through the posts until you think you understand how FCP is used. Then find some potential trades. Add the channel and fib projection to a chart and post the screenshot here, with your questions. You will receive a reply from someone who will give you honest but brief feedback. Then try a trade and see if it gives you usable results. If it doesn't, you can ask for a review here as well.

The best of trading to you.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
i think the main issue here is the expectation of target.

your channel width is more than 100 pips.

personally day trading for a m5/15 entry, we don't frequently get more than 100 pips profit.

in my chart i lessen the channel width by placing point 3 at the outer channel providing around 60 pips or less target.

i would shift the channel from your position to mine when A exceeded the previous high and

B did not go lower than previous low. then there was a strong candle break down which gave me a better entry.

then C and D formed but i did not shift the channel to D.

reasons are D gave me a worst entry and i prefer a strong candle break at outer channel.

both TP1 and 2 reached.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
where you draw the fib from not the fib channel

--- 帖子 #580 ---
your channel is upward sloping, so you are selling.

when price leaves the channel, it has to break down the bottom outer channel line.

you have to shift your fib 100 to where price break down at the bottom outer channel line.

please read post 1 three times with all the instructions, links and videos.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
when you are selling, the channel is sloping upward not downward sloping. see my chart of post 598.

vice versa for buy.

normal channel has 2 lines.

fib channel let you better fit the fractals to any of the 5 lines.

so you have more options and flexibility.

Hi Seysin,

I put my SL to BE once my TP1 reach, and usually I take my profit either 1/3 or 1/2 of it. but on that trade, the price not even reach TP1 but to my SL first. as InTheBox said maybe in low TF it is better to make the channel < 60 pips

--- 帖子 #592 ---
imagine that you come to the computer at the red vertical line.

where is the high point immediately before the red vertical line? isn't point 1 the right yellow arrow?

then from that high point 1 put on a trend line to touch all the other high points to find your point 2.

get a straight line with only point 1 and 2 touching with no other points touching before point 2 and in between point 1 and 2.

Hi Seysin32

I really appreciate your efforts . I am hoping someday you'll allow me to make a difference as you have to me.

i still dont understand the subjectivity of drawing the trendline. The Rule's say that we should find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak). On the contrary to an uptrend, we should find the last Lowest High (or Top preceding the last minimum peak) i assume.

From the image you've recently shared, in a downtrend , isnt that the Highest peak? Point 2 circled by you looks like a High to me.

Please understand i am trying to develop a trendline approach similar to yours so i can make correct observations going forward. i dont care if i lose a trade or 2 as long as i dont blow my account because of misinterpretation.

Thanks again for your efforts.

Hi, Seysin. Thanks for the explanation. Here I attach another chart, and some questions are on the chart. Please advise whether am I correct or not. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Point 1 I marked the last local maximum preceding the minimum. From this point I drew a line to the left until the first touch with the shadow of the candle, this is point 2 (from point 1 to point 2 of the TL should not be crossed by candles).

--- 帖子 #604 ---
There are no swings on H1 in your channel, it's just a continuous upward movement. However, there may be a model on the m5, but watch carefully for the trigger levels and the signal candle. While everything is going up, it may take time, do not rush and do not forget that today is Friday.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
if i may give a different perspective.

post 1: "On the example of uptrend.

Find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak)."

so in a downtrend, we find the last lowest high preceding (just before or immediately before) the last bottom.

this is the circled point 1 in the chart.

then find point 2. the trend line from circled point 1 to circled point 2 should not be touched by any candle or its tail.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
We never enter as soon as the price crosses the TL (there are exceptions to this rule). We expect the price to return to the level of 1.000 (Trigger 1) or to the level of 0.750-0.786 (Trigger 2). At these levels, we expect a signal candle. This issue has already been discussed in detail, links are collected in post 1.

ok so here are my questions if any one  willing to reply.

1: how to draw the parallel channels

2. how to measure the width of the channel  since the post does not specify a point like point 1 or point 2 from which we need to measure the width

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Do you move your fibo grid from the break of the TL to the actual entry point or does it always stay at the break of the TL no matter what? I guess if it returns to 1.000 that answers my question but what about trigger 2?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
assuming you got the correct point 1 and 2, fib 100 remains at the intersection of trend line and candle body closing above/below it.

trade entries will be price reactions at fib 100 and 78.2/75.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
so i can see how the hieght of channel is used but i  can not tell how to choose the parallel channel distances

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Beautiful thanks for the clarification. And for reactions we look for candlestick patterns at these levels 100 & 75-78.6. What kind of experience did you gather from your entry points so far?

What is wrong with this setup? I mean, is it just a loss one or did some of the conditions not meet?

go to seysin's profile and click images. you will see how he entered trades (circled) at the 2 locations after a good closed candle (pin bar, engulf, etc)

as for me i do enter trades without candle closing or go to the m1 chart, as long as we are trading in the htf direction.

there was not enough information on the chart for a decision.

1. what was the higher time frame saying? higher high higher low?

2. based solely on the given chart, price was breaking out of a range. wait for retrace to buy at arrow. the 2nd, 3rd, 4th arrow if you arrived late at the computer.

XAU/USD Fresh example.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #642 ---
1 ) If your chart does not have the channel tool, you can use the trendline. You have already identified points 1 and 2 that define the TL. You are looking for point 3. In your case, it is the highest point above TL and also above the dotted resistance line. Measure from point 3 straight down to the intersection with TL. You will use this measure to draw your fibonacci retracement. 2) Yes, on my system it is called a fibonacci retracement. Some chart software may call it a different name.

When you draw the fib, make sure that 1.0 is intersecting with the place on TL where the breakout occurs. 0.0 is the measured distance below the TL (on your chart).

3) I don't have the fib channel tool on my charts, I only have the top and bottom channel lines. If I need a mid-point, I just draw it with a trendline tool.

If you watch Seysin32's videos, you will see that he draws a fibonacci retracement from point 3 down to the TL, inside the channel. Then, he moves the fib over to where the 1.0 lines is at the breakout. If you can do that on your chart, you won't need to measure from 3 to TL.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Friends, I changed the Fibo levels a bit. Take a look at the screenshot.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

As you can see, I added levels 0.236, 1.146, 1.382, 1.500 and 1.618. I will explain the meaning of the changes. Lines 1.146 - 1.618 allow us to see the reaction of prices to these levels before the price exits the channel. The rule is that if the price accurately responds to these levels, there is a high probability (but of course, this is not a guarantee) that it will also respond to other projection lines after exiting the channel. See how it works on the chart:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Levels 1.146 and 0.236 are also members of the Fibo number sequence and are located behind TP1 and TP2. How it works. If the price has precisely reached the level of 0.236 instead of 0.382 (TP1), the probability that the price will reach the level of 1.146 instead of 0.000 (TP2) increases. It just means a shift in TP levels.

These changes are not critical, you can use the levels that you use in your terminal and which work well for you. The main thing is that Trigger levels 1(2), TP1(2) remain unchanged.

Hello, my friend!

You asked about the likelihood of success. If I turn to the statement of my account, then more than 80% of the deals are successful (I do not like to talk about it, while I am living in Russia. I think you understand what I mean). I will say this, for me, the winrate is quite high. With the right approach and some experience, it will be possible for you too. I am not interested in a single amount per deal, only constancy. Even a small advantage with consistency makes us successful. In short, I try to approach trading according to the principle of the casino.

The second question was about the time spent. Yes, I spent a very, very long time in front of the screen. For at least 7 years in a row I lived near a computer. With interruptions in sleep, food and physical exercises. There was a time, when I spent time in trade from morning to evening, seven days a week. It's very hard. Perhaps if I were led by an experienced mentor it would be easier for me (and I would not lose a lot of money), I do not know. Many times I wanted to give up all of this. I do not know if this is good or bad. I can not advise this to anyone. Everyone chooses for himself.

I believe that information, to understand enough, you only need to practice. Anyone who carefully studys everything that is collected in post 1 and reads in a thread a discussion, will be able to understand and use FCP. Now I have nothing more to add. I hope you will be react with understanding to the fact that I will rarely appear. I wish you good health, good mood and successful trading.

Great thread. Looks like I'm starting to understand how to draw channels and fib retrenchment, and it took me only 3-4 hours of reading this post and practicing. I'm far away from correct drawing but understanding is there. Now just "small part" left called practice. Don't want to ask any questions at this point as I think reading over and over and over all information multiple times will get me an answer, plus it's better learning that way. God bless you both and hope you have a successful trading ahead.

Hello, first of all I want to thank you for sharing the knowledge and effort Seysin.

I've started reading the thread (I'm around half-way), was practising and I've got some doubts that the rules don't make clear to me to build the channel, perhaps is because english is not my native language or because I didn't finish the thread, if is the second case I apologize.

When a impulse is not too "energic" from 1, you place the 3 in the center of the channel, but this does not happen everytime; for example when the swing from 1 is not too big, then you make 3 in another point and not the max/min of the swing from 1, like here (post 32):
https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...6&d=1585936486

Is my guess about right?

Also, I know you can build 3 from 1 or 2 with a big impulse and 3 will be on the other side of the channel, but is it possible to build a not too big impulse from 2 to the center of the channel and make it 3 like you do when the impulse goes from 1 to 3? (See picture as example I edited)

Hope is not too confusing! Thanks

--- 帖子 #712 ---
seysin stated yesterday that he had completed all he has to show in this thread and he will rarely be here.

if we read carefully his posts the answer should be there. so maybe we have to read them multiple times.

my opinion concerning point 3 from 1 or 2.

in your chart, point 1 to 3 is straighter and have less retrace than point 2 to 3. so point 1 to 3 is to be used.

you have placed the channel mid line on point 3. this is correct.

if you find that the channel width is too wide, place the channel outer line on point 3 to make channel narrower.

if you find that the channel width is too narrow, place the channel 25% line on point 3 to make channel wider.
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post12884346

so the channel is adjustable to cater for your target expectation.

a good channel is built when price reacts to as many channel lines as possible.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Thanks a lot for your answer, it makes sense!

FCP disadvantages:

- Requires some trading experience, not suitable for absolute beginners.

- MT4 is not the best software for graphical constructions.

- You can not immediately take and use.

i know that there are many novices looking at this thread.

i understand that it would be difficult to follow if you do not have 1-2 years of trading experience.

i would advise to try it a couple of times to see whether it suits your style of trading.

if it does not suit beginners, i would advise to go for more simple thread like "roadmap" which uses moving averages to trade.

hey "inthebox" . i have been trying this method but i am not getting an intutional sense of it.  there are few questions if you would like to answer since "sye" is no longer addressing this thread.

1. since we are trading breakouts  i am having trouble identifying them

2. how to tell that the breakout will be upwards or downward ? ( although i know the trendline  will project project the direction but how to decide the direction . for eg. in 1 hour you see the the graph rising but in say 5m you see an upward trendline thus we are betting for it to breakdown lower.

3. when to enter a trade. as sye told that the graph will retest it but in many cases during breakdown the prices moves very fast ( in 1m or 3m ) thus you can never actually see the restest and the trade that was needed to go right goes wrong. and the winning percentage declines.

i will really apppreciate any help from anyone who uses this method.

thanks. ( i have read the thread but still read it again if anyone suggest a post that particularly answers my questions . )

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Coin tossing will be about as accurate as other methods.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
1. since we are trading breakouts i am having trouble identifying them

if you are having problem with lower time frame, why not switch to higher time frame. switch your time frame one or two higher.
2. how to tell that the breakout will be upwards or downward ? ( although i know the trendline will project project the direction but how to decide the direction . for eg. in 1 hour you see the the graph rising but in say 5m you see an upward trendline thus we are betting for it to breakdown lower.

solely looking at h1 graph rising is not a basis to sell in m5. something is missing. h4 must be falling to reflect that h1 rising is a retracement.

my example in the chart using h4 as htf and m30 as ltf.

in simplified form, h4 is enough to show me the medium trend.
3. when to enter a trade. as sye told that the graph will retest it but in many cases during breakdown the prices moves very fast ( in 1m or 3m ) thus you can never actually see the restest and the trade that was needed to go right goes wrong. and the winning percentage declines

it's very chopping in m3 and m1 as the stop loss is very tight but that's your choice. if you find m15 is not so choppy then use it.

to get the best of both world, split into 2 positions - one for breakout, one for retrace.

do your own back testing. i believe that there are much more successful trades than failed one. and don't forget it also depends on your expectation how far the trade can move.

and also it will fail at the region when h4 begin to switch sides.

--- 帖子 #734 ---

Hello, friends. I hope all of you are well.

As I noticed, many have difficulty in defining the 3rd point in the examples, that we analyzed and they looked "not according to the rules." Let’s clarify this question. There is nothing complicated about it. Consider the example of the uptrend. When you built the channel, look at the left side of the chart behind the outside of the channel. What did the price do before it hit the channel? Did she fall or go up in the direction of your channel (trend)? If the swings rise up, you can expand the channel so that one of the top appears on the midline. And that’s all. You may ask - we get a wider projection, will it work? The answer is yes, if you get confirmation at the price of Fibo levels before the breakdown of the channel and confirmation at the price of Trigger levels 1 and 2 (especially 2). In addition, when choosing the channel width, consider that you are building a projection on the trend, or on its correction (see htf). I picked up a few examples so that you understand how it looks.

By the way, someone said about throwing a coin. This is a very good example. I wrote earlier that my approach to trading is similar to the principle of a casino. This is not the same as throwing a coin. At the casino there is an advantage (I'm talking about roulette) - this is zero. So the odds are 49/50, or so. But this 1% gives the casino billions of dollars. The question is the number of deals. Build your advantage on your system and use it. I am sure that we all have it and it is much more than 1%. It remains to do the same thing. There will always be those who did not bother to study and try, and those who did. The difference between them becomes visible only with time. The first will simply disappear, and you will live. The FCP system itself does not give you a big advantage, it’s just a template, fill it with what you better own, and it will work like a good watch.

Good luck friends.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
so i take it that both h1 and m15 is used for trade entry. remember to look at h4 for trend.

this means

h4 is rising --> h1 is falling (retracement) --> m15 expecting soon to be rising as per h4 trend.

it will be dependent on your expectation of profit.

if entry per h1, then it is h1 target (larger) --> look only at h1.

if entry per m15, then it is m15 target (smaller) --> look only at m15.

or if entry per m15, but h1 target --> look only at h1, because your fib is based on h1 channel.

depending on the currency pair, be realistic and flexible about targets.

Hello, friends!

I hope everyone is doing well.

I am glad to see that you are using the method and this gives the result.

Two fresh examples. On the EUR/USD chart, a beautiful FСP and a good result.

The second XAUUSD chart, is an example of the projection of a horizontal channel. This is a new approach to projections of horizontal channels.

I’m not ready to explain it to you until I have done a sufficient number of tests. But in advance I can say that it works well. It is interesting that on the chart you will see the projection, but you will not see the channel . As soon as I am convinced that the method works, I will share it with you.

It was Big News movement.Could be the opposite way.

Firstly, this is not entirely true. If you watched the price at the time of the news, you could see how, after the publication of the news, the price began to fall. This went on for about an hour. All who expected the sale, sold. Well, then the price did, what was expected - turned up. Secondly, what will happen next no longer matters, the model worked.

Have a question to most experienced users...Which one of options below is the correct one?

The channel created on A is wider but looks more balanced than B.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #819 ---
if you prefer A, the channel is too wide for h1.

h4 or d1 would have a more balanced view. this means that the trade would have been held longer.

h1 would have presented more trade opportunities but with shorter targets.

trade targets according to the time frame one is trading.

i have a different view.

trend is down but price at d1 support.

price is in a range per yellow box.

use horizontal channel when price break out of box.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Thanks Inthebox for your response,

I have also done up EU as shown... did i draw correctly? I feel that the Channel 1 is in play now and might go to the TP as shown by the arrows before price comes down to put Channel 2 into play.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
work needs to be done on channel point 3.

analyze to trade trend or counter trend. probably counter trend gets one third or quarter of trend target.

good old trend is higher high higher low.

if in doubt on your reference chart, go one or two higher up chart.

d1 tells me in range. h4 tells me in range and in triangle. coming to apex for breakout.

price above h4 yellow dotted trend line, i shall buy only.

h1 watch out for downward sloping channel to buy.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Hi there,

May I ask which option between A and C is most convenient or even correct?

Following creation rules for FCP, we should find the Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak) for point 1, from there point 2 and then 3. And this is draw on figure A.

I've found several examples where different Highest Lows are used and they does not preceed the maximum peak. Figure C

Figure B is just the middle point scenario between A and C, where a trigger candle is not present and we must correct our channel.

Thanks in advance.

channel needs to be redrawn (or not redrawn) as new fractals are created.

so it would depend on the time you are at the computer (represented by vertical yellow line)

A - present no set up.

B - channel shifted and entry after retrace (assuming your style is to wait for retrace)

C - channel need not be redrawn as at that point in time there was already retrace coming at B.

Can someone help me confirm if I have the right channel? Thanks.

Thanks for your answer Inthebox,

In this case our point 1 now always will be the " Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak)" and that was my initial concern trying to find a mechanical way to draw FCPs.

Based on fractals (assuming we are talking about Bill Williams Fractals) the FCP should be as follows:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #833 ---
In addition to what Inthebox said. Always pay attention to what did the price before the channel. In option "A" you include in the channel the area of pure upward movement. In this case, the probability of reaching the target projection levels is greatly reduced.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Inthebox said everything correctly. In my opinion, the best setting is option B. Two tops are approximately at the same level, in such cases we ignore the insignificant difference between the tops levels.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

sorry, I replaced the chart with a more accurate one.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
in my opinion trading is not an exact science. can be mechanical but cannot be 100% mechanical.

what i try to illustrate with the following chart is that one has to consider the context of what is happening in the surrounding.

if i had drawn trend line B without consideration to trend line A, then all my entries will be getting a worst price than using trend line A.

likewise if two point 1 is ambiguous/not clear due to the levels made not much difference, then the basis is that i compare the present and previous, and take the one that can give me a better price.

Hello Seysin, Thank you for sharing your method. From backtesting in hindsight it looks very good entry method for my approach. That said i use it only on M5 TF on predetermined key levels.

Now i start to forward test on some positions to explore more. My targets also not always agrees with your method, but i need much more testing to see which target approach works better for me.

After first seeing this approach i started to see this setups everywhere on every TF. I think it's important not to get lost in the bushes and observe this pattern on significant levels. Well at least for me as FCP is everywhere.

Heres one Deal i made today. UC. My exit obviously too early, i will adapt with time.

Hello. I am glad that you use the FCP and see the potential for yourself in this. This is really a very simple and effective method. Now in my trade I do not use anything else. Follow the top-down analysis HTF to LTF, consider the strong levels of S/R and the opening of the day. And that’s all. You always get your pips.

This what i meant by its everywhere. GJ i see slightly different. But its just shows that usually u can find this pattern both ways it's comes down to whose overall bias is right.

And i not trying to find mistakes here, just interested to discuss how can we make sure that we on the right side of FCP.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
yes it can go both ways. but which way can hold better? that's where different experience comes in.

my bias is down so i take sell. i can buy but target should be small.

if i sell only, i have 2 options.

1. to exit trade take a loss if not going my way for the moment and try to sell again with better price later?

2. to hold trade because my higher time frame tells me to do so?

Hi.

Morning DAX

--- 帖子 #880 ---
For those who buy the retrace at the trigger zones (0, .786-.75).  How far does the price have to move away from the 0 line on the initial move for you to cancel the trade.  For example if the price make an initial move from the 0 line to the TP1 (.386) will you not buy again at the retrace to the trigger lines?

--- 帖子 #881 ---
ea

--- 帖子 #882 ---
as long as price does not close below TP2, i will take the buy, especially so in smaller time frame. because the channel width is smaller and there is more wriggling.

the reasoning is price often retraces to test the break out zone.

It looks like strong downtrend (2LH+2LL) with no clue of reversal-> low probability trade.It should be more then 2 factors to enter the market in case of daytrading.

try to trade with the methodology below.

in short: breakout, retrace, continuation in the direction of higher time frame trend, preferably with divergence.

example for sell in a down trend. take the upward sloping trend line as a channel.

Here is a simple daytrading strategy using FCP:

check out this link and find strong trending pair (let's say Strong Sell on H1); check out indies for not beeng oversold; check out nearest support; go to M5-15 and use FCP to sell.

One may add breaking of previous day low/high- it's a big plus to make a higher probability trade.

HD and RD are very helpfull as well.

GPB/NZD H1.

I wont trade this yet, as its looking for the big reversal of this long downtrend (daily look good though)

But it show how the Seysin method is amazing, using 0.75/0.786 fib region. Broken and retest tell you your channel is right.

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Another example and confluence.

CADCHF H4

When 0.786/0.75 Zone is a SR flip. it really add confidence.

Also the break off the channel is right on the 20 EMA.

Notice how the zone is also exactly at daily pivot.... this is my favorite setup... SR Flip + Daily pivot. and of course divergence on last swing.

hi experts,

I am currently trying FCP on my demo account before dabbling it on a real account. May I know what did i miss out in this chart? EURJPY was able to hit 38.2 but it had a strong drawback till entry level. How do I know whether or not my trade will be invalidated before it reaches 0.0?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Hi! Sorry if I may sound "ironic". But if anyone knew what will happen, we would not be in this forum...

The chart looks perfect to me. Beautifully hit the 38.2. And then? We never know.

A good idea imho in this case would be to work with trailing stops. If it continues: perfect. If not: at least saved part of the win

--- 帖子 #955 ---
I see some kind of bullish engulfing on H1. You need to investigate deeper. On M30 & M15 there's bullish regular divergence, also multiple bullish engulfing PA appeared. Also you can check a volume - bears not pushing price anymore, bulls trying to catch the move.

Also, try to avoid creating big wide channels. Wide channel increasing you risk.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
we never know when's the reversal.

look left, there was a pause at fib 38.2. that was a support.

that was a good 70-80 pips run. i normally look for 30 to 60 pips.

many ways for target.

exit everything at fib 38.2.

or one exit at 38.2, the other at 0.

or i can double the lot size with half the distance.

or

keep channel width say 30 to 60 pips. that will reduce the fib extention which make it easier to hit fib 0.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
EU. Some interesting situation. We have 2 opposite signals (for bullish divergence & bearish trend continuation), but second signal appeared later.

Channel fully broken. Missed first wave, but catched some pips on second. Also NY session opened, so waiting for PA confirmation that bears are still in game.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
this is a good example of trading the retracement according to the time frame target that one is trading.

Here are the trendlines for H1 according to Sperando method (as stated in post #1 'In the FCP, for TL we will use the Sperandeo method (Trader Vic).')

the two red one are strict Spredando TL the, yellow one an accepted one by Seysin method.

if you would trade at the point you enter you prolly would need to go to a lower time frame to find a valid channel.

Others are using less strict TL but it its not the OP method, so its difficult to expect correct Fibonacci projection if the channel is wrong from the start.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Seysin said that mt4 not the best, not me.

deal with the 2 comments first:

1. if selling, the lower channel should not touch any price body or shadow.

2. your channel is more than 160 pips wide, which means that you are expecting target of there about. are you comfortable with that? i myself expects 30-60 pips for day trading.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Oooh. This channel is too wide. Try to build more tight channel, it would give you not so much in pips, but be more safe & target can be easily reached.

Also on M30 there's trend continuation divergence, so you could enter on second swing.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Thank you, noted

--- 帖子 #974 ---
I stand corrected and thank you for your patience,hope this charts are better

--- 帖子 #975 ---
you got point 1 and 2 correct. now work on point 3.

get point 3 as straight a line from point 1 or point 2 with as few retracement as possible. see 1st example.

the placement of the channel at point 3 is adjustable. can be the extreme outer line, the mid line, or the quadrant line so as to get different fib projection.

i provide another perspective of h1. the channel point 2 is not drawn on the lowest point as per above example.

the distance of point 1 and 2 is shorter. it's ok as long as the channel bottom line does not touch any candle body or tail to the left.

the drawing of channel would very much dependent on when is your arrival on seeing the chart.

m15 showed a late arrival at chart compared to an earlier arrival. it was a break out entry. no retrace.

In first setup:

Trade was missed, price was fly away quickly without deep retracements, so forgot this setup and build another for sell.

In second setup:

First spike was lost but then price consolidating, I saw some PA - high price rejection (pinbar & doji) but news coming in calendar. Changed deal to smaller lot size & decided to leave it one. That was risky, but spike was controlled by bears & price rollbacked to its position at beginning (•̀ᴗ•́)و

trading is like dealing in property. it's about location, location, location.

trading is about waiting at the location for the right timing.

I’m trading eurusd/gbpusd on m5.

First, checking economic calendar to be ready for price spikes.

Then checking m15/m30/h1 to find S&R.

Building fibo channel & waiting for divergence/price action/volumes changes.

Combining TFs is important for build S&R zones and choosing bulls or bears side.

When you enter a trade and it pulls back. For how long can one hold.?

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
don't know what type of trader are you, which classification you fall into.

to me, for day trading, time is not a factor to exit trade, except at the time before i go to bed to hold or not to hold.

what matters more is which level of SR that i want to exit if price pull back.

like here, i felt that the upper resistance zone is stronger, so i held on.

but for scalping, it's different. you exit at the resistance just above as whipsaws occurring are higher.

however there is also more opportunities for trade set ups.

so medium term trading and investing are another story.

the smaller time frame showed downtrend.

went into a range and broke down.

the h4 h1 broke a downward sloping trend line.

they are not uptrend or downtrend as have yet to break the top to qualify as uptrend.

my bias is slightly to the upside for higher time frame.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
I see some kind of regular divergence, but another hidden divergence signal also tells me that downtrend could continue. Wait for retracement & confirmation of bulls strength.

But on H4/D1 I see uptrend.

Thanks for the answer, I get it.

I did not see FCP models on your chart, so I posted my chart so that you can analyze your mistakes.

H&S, divergences and etc, complement the FCP model. In this case, the model was quite accurate, we can say beautiful.

With proper building, you would receive an accurate signal to Trigger line 1 and the exact achievement of TP.

That is all that is needed.

EURUSD H1

Today, investigating how to build channel & get early but safe entry.

Used version 1 of setup but think it's not right, cause catched risky price jump - that's why not perfect entry

But will be cool to use version 2:

Think that channel should be built closer to price divergence - it give more opportunity for early entry & more space for possible strong price retracements.

What do you think?

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
there were many factors came into play, of which the most important is

the strong candle that break the support/resistance and/or the trend line/channel.

opinion after the fact.

the left image shown was 'perfect'

1. strong candles break and pullback at both sr and tl channel.

2. price under major d1 support turned resistance.

3. retracement to fib 50/61. head and shoulder formed with lower right shoulder.

4. divergence.

people can draw the channel differently.

the right image still worked out fine.

there was a trend line /channel break and a pullback on the same candle.

can see better in lower time frame and entry could be at fib proj 100.

I subscribed this Thread immediately

and I want to learn your System...

I trade with MT4,

I have read your Posts for Settings FCP in MT4

And I can draw the Channels now

But I did not make anything with Fibo before

therefore I can not find Fibo Grid on MT4

There are 2 Tools here:

that differ from yours...

Which Tool I have to use??

Or may be other Settings???

In this case, of course, you meant the sell. I very rarely open a position immediately after a channel breakout. The reason is simple - you will have a very low win rate. Basically, we enter after retesting trigger levels 1 or 2 (1.000 and 0.786-0.750 Fib). The appearance at these levels of candlestick patterns, PA patterns, volume changes, etc. will give you a signal to enter with a good R/R ratio. All this was consider in detail at the beginning of the thread. For example post

Is this channel correct? Should I expect the price to go up?

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
Perhaps, but additional signals are needed. In this case, I would not use such a channel. While waiting for the trend to continue, it is better to look for an opportunity to enter on LT. I advise you not to look for current entry opportunities in the live market, but to train in building the "classic" FCP model (based on historical data), which is described in the first posts of the thread. This is a proven way of learning.

Sell is not confirmed here, IMHO.

1. Yes, we see bears divergence.

2. But, bulls has strength, and bulls divergence detected. Also bullish engulfing pattern & pinbar that rejecting lower prices tells that setup is not confirmed.

So we have false channel breakout.

Don't hurry, keep calm & wait for strong & 100% confirmed setup.

You can use OsMA indicator with 8,21,8 settings. It shows more data about divergences.

Please, be careful

m5 vs h1.

don't forget higher time frame analysis.

1. resistance tested 5 times - matter of time will break up.

2. broke down upward sloping trend line, then reversed back above.

3. and 2nd time back up trend line as a pin bar with higher low.

4. compare the first 2 resistance touches with the last 3. the bounces down getting shorter.

5. hidden divergence - means trend continuation.

all the above are footprints telling momentum is up.

Seysin,

It looks like you have added the trigger level of 0.886 to your FIBO and have executed at that level.  I have noticed that is also a key level or retracement on scalps.  Can you confirm if this is now part of your FCP?

friend, i have seen your trades. you were winning today but stayed too long in the trades.

if you do not mind, the following are 2 big killers.

1. big lot units

2. overtrade

unless you are trading small amount of money to gain 10% a day. but that is another story and strategy.

all we need is to get 1% a day consistently. whether it is with 15 pips, 20 pips, 30 pips a day ......... for 1% a day.

the power of cumulative compounding will turn $10k to $2mil in 2 years.

there is no hurry, unless we do not have the patience to wait for 2 years.

You are wrong, I'm not winning today

My account is small so the gain is big.

But maybe thats biggest problem. Small account and I don't care about it like I should.

I think I have a problem with overtrading.

I know the idea of compouding very well and thats my goal to achive.

I have over 10 years of experience in Forex but most of this time it was only theoretical and in my example when it comes to real trading I get little confused.

Need to practice, practice, practice.

Do You have some tips when You have a bad day? How many trades is max?

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
How many trades is max?

maybe limit to 2 trades per session. 2 for london session. 2 for new york session.

if we think in term of percentage win/loss per day, then we get rid of the number of trades per day.

there is no magic formula. each of us has to find our comfort zone.

say we decide on 1% win per day and with equity of $10k.

decide the number of pips that suits yourself for your strategy ..... 15 pips, 20 pips, 25 pips .........

say 15 pips. then use about $7 per pip (10 divide by 15). if you are not comfortable then adjust.

that will be $105 which is 1% of $10k plus or minus.

20 pips will be $5 per pip.

25 pips will be $4 per pip ..... etc .....

when You have a bad day?

for some it will be difficult to get consistent 1% day.

we can look in term of 5% week or 20% month instead.

we limit the % loss per day according to our own comfort zone.

provided we have a win rate of 70%, the following is an example.

limit 3% loss per day.

win 1% -  stop trading with 1 trade per day. target achieved.

loss 1% - double next trade lot unit to 2% (if win stop trading)

loss 3% - stop trading with max 2 trades per day.

of course this will not suit every one. each of us has to find our own comfort zone.

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
another tip is to trade multi time frame in order to limit the number of trades.

in the example i am using h1 and m15.

i am only allowed to look for trade if:

1. the h1 fractal (a) is breached.

2. then i draw the trend line (b). anything below i only sell.

3. discard trade if highest fractal (c) is breached.

4. switch to m15 from vertical line (d) onward.

5. in m15 start looking for trade if there is lower low lower high 1234.

divergences helped in the example.

Been away from trading for a while due to a lot of uncontrolled events in our lives. Also lost all of my indicators, ea's, etc. that I had saved for several years...another story. Decided to see what has happened since I was last on FF, and came across this thread which complements my trading beliefs...TL, S/R, pull-backs, and fibos. Thank you Seysin32 for sharing your knowledge, experience, and specifics to your method of trading. Since I am at page 1 of the thread, it will take me a while to digest and catch-up. As I move forward from page to page, is it appropriate to ask question that may already have been answered past the point which I have progressed? If not, then I will simply jot my questions down and move forward hoping to find answers.

Thanks again Seysin32 for sharing,

Thanks for the kind welcome. I will certainly ask questions when they arise. I will be on page 1 for several days as there is a lot to understand and absorb. My learning style requires me to 1st just read without a high degree of understanding, then re-read at a slower pace with a better understanding, and finally re-read for the 3rd time with hopefully a high degree of understanding to the extent I could ask legitimate questions.

Evening Seysin32, I have been studying 4-6 hours a day primarily on page 1 since last Tuesday. I am now in the process of going back in time and practicing on drawing the TL, channel after TL is broken, and displaying fibos. I have discovered that after locating point 1 and 2, it is often necessary to make TL adjustments primarily at point 1. Also, as shown in the attached chart, it is also necessary to adjust the initial TL break either up or down depending on direction of trend. I have been staying on the 1H charts as you suggested; however, at some point in time when I'm demo trading on current charts, I will drop down to place trades on the 5/15M charts. The attached chart also showed regular bearish divergence which I failed to draw.

Thanks again for sharing. As I mentioned in my first post, I am somewhat familiar with your approach to making deals, but was never able to really put it all together like you have in your trading method.

Later,

Tx15 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
my perspective.

--- 帖子 #1315 ---
I believe the attached chart is an example of when the TL is not accurately drawn. It becomes clear that's the case when after the TL is broken, then nothing on the fibs align properly and everything heads south. Will practice some more tomorrow, as I'm tired tonight and ready for my nightly Jack & coke.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
Thanks Inthebox, I just now noticed where you had posted your perspective. So based on the LH and LL, the trend has changed and I should be essentially trying to find deals in the opposite direction than the deal I posted. Is that correctly stated?

Thank you, as your perspective is what I'm seeking and appreciate,

Tx15

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
my thought process:

1. support (higher time frame better).

2. 4 points of H, HH, L, HL. (in lower time frame)

3. find a trend line that cuts through a strong candle

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
My opinion about your two examples:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1319 ---
Thank you Seysin32 for your input. I am still reading, studying, and trying to gain a comfortable grasp on your trading method. Since I am only looking at the 1H charts by going back in time to practice drawing the TL, that will be the only charts I post. If I draw the channels and the fib projections based on the width of the channels, your readers will think that I am trading these setups, where in reality, I am only practicing hypothetical setups on the 1H charts. When I do decide to post the additional method components (channels and fibs), I will post the 1H charts showing only the break in TL, and then drop down to the 5 or 15M charts to actually draw the channel and fib. I would hence be using the HTF, the 1H, for determining the current trend for taking deals on the lower TF's.

I am trying my best to learn your method as outlined on page 1. I have added the volume indicator to my template, as I know the importance of its use for making deals. I use the MACD primarily for divergence. In addition, after the TL has been broken, I normally would seek retraces back to the 100 or 75/78.6 levels, and accompanied by setup candles as you described before actually entering a position on the 5 or 15M charts.

As I've said before, your trading method includes the components that I believe in, but was unable to organize them consistently as you have presented. Thanks!!!

Evening again Seysin32, as it is 6 pm cst,

Thank you for such a clear and informative response on your post #1348. I have studied the charts you posted several times, and I will certainly add this post to the archive that I'm maintaining. In addition, since I'm not that familiar with the accumulation area you alluded to, I will concentrate on your FCP method of TL, BO, channel, fib projection, levels 100 and 75/78.6, and TP's at 38.2 and 0.00. Those trade deals develop daily.

Thanks for your comment regarding my wife. The doctor discharged her today, and she is now resting peacefully as it is almost impossible to get any quality rest in a hospital setting.

Going back to page 1. Will re-read again, as each time I gain additional insight as how to successfully trade the FCP method.

Thanks again,

Morning Seysin32,

The deals you made on the 1M E/U were beautiful as they developed. What TF chart or charts were you watching before you moved to the 1M chart for making the deals? Or were you watching only the 1M E/U chart?

Thanks for response,

Hello.

I use the H1 charts (only the current candle), m5, m1 and a tick chart with Heikin-Ashi candles.

Since all the charts are displayed on my monitors at the same time, I see the whole situation at once.

--- 帖子 #1363 ---
Thanks Seysin32 for your response.

How many ticks do you use on the HA candles chart? I have observed the monitor setup that you have shown...very impressive. I have only one MT4 monitor setup, and have always felt as though I needed to upgrade my trading hardware.

Thanks for all that you have shared on your FCP method,

Hi Seysin32,

I'm new to this thread. Still learning from you by reading what you have taught us here. Attached is Straits Time Index. Would you be able to comment if I plot the FCP correctly? Thanks in advance.

My workstation consists of three monitors 27 "each (for this I have a powerful video card on my computer). Now this size is redundant for me, 24" is fine. Thus, I can see at the same time all the charts that I use in trading. As for the tick chart, this is a 99 tick chart. The candle fills in about 1.5 to 3 minutes. Combined with Heikin Ashi candlesticks, this gives a clear picture (no noise) of micro-trends for scalping. See example below: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1370 ---
In terms of indices and stocks, these are charts with a lot of gaps. This can cause inaccuracies in the building of the FCP model. In addition, channels are often broken with a gap. What to do if the channel is broken with a gap, I will write about this later.

A practice FCP position on EUR/USD 15M that I took this morning. I confirmed the direction by looking at the 1H HTF. Per Seysin32's method, once the TL was broken, I drew the channel, the fib projection based on the width of the channel, and waited for the right setup with supporting volume. Regular divergence, which I didn't show was also supporting the position I placed. I believe the key to taking this successful position was the correct setup candles retracing back to the 75/78.6 levels.

I will start tomorrow from page 1, dedicate as much time as it requires, and then proceed to read and study all of the thread posts up through the current page.

Mantra of a successful trader.

1. A winning trader picks his time and place of combat where the odds are in his favor.

2. Be alert to both potential opportunities and dangers.

3. Have the patience to wait and the decisiveness to strike.

Everything is difficult at first.

With time and practice, it will all become clear.

A battle does not determine the result of the war.

--- 帖子 #1381 ---
Evening Inthebox,

The mantra you stated in post #1394 is a truism in my personal opinion. As a retired educator in the public school system of America, I believe that your country was referred to at one time as the Garden State...correct me if I'm wrong. Regardless, I appreciate the valuable input that you have provided to this thread. I am still learning Seysin32's FCP method. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience as it relates to the FCP method of making deals and placing trades.

Looking forward to a very positive trading week for all that believe and apply the FCP method of trading,

If the gap breaks the channel, connect the candle close in the channel and the open candle outside the channel.

Place the Fibo projection at the intersection of this line and the TL. I found two examples from my archive and one recent USOil example.

Results on the EUR/USD 15M chart. I place emphasis on all that Seysin32 and Inthebox have shared with us. Spend time on the TL and adjust as necessary...this is the basis for the FCP method. Draw an inaccurate TL and nothing else lines up appropriately. I concentrate on several factors after the TL has been drawn. PA of points 1 and 2 in order to establish point 3. High volume is a key to placing a deal. Divergence is nice to have, but not absolutely necessary. I also believe that the setup candles play a big role in making a successful trade...this takes patience, and some trades are lost, but I still emphasize the importance. I most often wait for a retrace back to the 75/78.6 level before considering a position. I always look at HTFs to confirm trend direction.

If I have misstated anything, then please correct me. I am still learning and will continue to learn for quite some time.

Thanks again for the FCP method,

my take on eurusd.

3 opportunities today. 2 sell and 1 buy. buy is counter trend.

the h4 tells me that it is a sell day because price is under the 2 trend lines.

1. sell at range or below day open.

2. buy above trend line and previous day low.

3. sell below day open and trend line.

--- 帖子 #1392 ---
the retrace already happened at fib 100 and 75 and was subtle.

Hello.

To assess the potential for moving beyond TP2, you need to look in the context of HTF. Also, see how price reacts to your projection lines - breaks and moves on, or can't break. Price makes higher highs (or lower lows) or not. Note that if the projection is confirmed and the price recognizes the Fib levels, in most cases the price will reach the opposite of the lowest/highest levels of the projection (from 1.382 low to 1.382 high, 1.618-1.618 or 2.000-2.000). As a rule, everything beyond TP2 is a bonus. I close part of the position on TP2, and move the rest part to BE and release.

Seysin32,

When you begin your day of looking for deals, what chart TF do you begin with before any other analysis? I'm still on page 1 for the fourth time, but once I'm finished this time, then progress should improve considerably. Is is ok to ask your time zone? My schedule is flexible, so when I really need to ask a question, I can do so when you are up and about.

Thanks again for sharing the FCP method with us,

Tx15

--- 帖子 #1418 ---
You can write to me at any time. If I am at the monitor, I will answer, if I am not, then there is no answer. Let me remind you that I wrote earlier that I do not recommend starting the study of FСP with trading on m1. I start the day by noting the timing of important news to come. Then I look at H1 what has happened in the intervening time. Since I am doing scalping, I am interested in micro-trends. All charts above 5-15 minutes are useless for this. Next, I look at how the price interacted with the daily opening line and the behavior of the volume on m1 (a minute chart can tell a lot). Finally, I define micro-trends using 5m and a tick chart.

Seysin, two questions about this setup (I didn't take it)

1) The volume increases with the candle coming out of the channel, then the next candle goes back in the channel, would this be a red flag for you to not take the deal?

2) Do you see an entry here?  There is a wick at the retest candle at the .786, but the trigger candle closes at the 0.382 so I don't see a way to enter.

Again can't thank you enough for your continued patience and excellent instruction.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
1. In itself, the return of the candle to the channel is not a signal.

2. Yes, here was a good scalp setup .

I used a projection on my chart to see the setup better. Candle # 1 breaks through the channel and is accompanied by the most significant volume for today. Candle # 2 - up, the volume falls. Candle 3 - even lower, the volume increases, closes below the line of the daily opening (dashed white). Candle wick # 4 for trigger 2 - confirmation. While writing the answer, the situation has developed, nevertheless TP2 has been achieved exactly - about 13p. I would enter at the close of candle # 3, and close at TP2.

I wanted to get your opinion on this trade that I took. I took this on the m5 but was concerned that it was breaking out of almost an 8 hour channel.  It looked good on the m15 except I couldn't get the EMAs to go in my favor on that time frame, going all the way down to a 8 & 13 EMA.

Hello!

I built a channel wider (too narrow projection to moving for almost 8 hours).

The deal was quite reasonable for a scalp, you could take about 20p, which you did.

But, I probably wouldn't have taken it... Why?

1. End of the European session + Friday.

2. I lacked cogency at the highs before the channel breakout.

--- 帖子 #1427 ---
Seysin, thank you very much for taking the time for such a detailed analysis. Would you mind elaborating on point 2? Are you looking for the top of the price to be seen with a lower MACD at that particular spot. I was comparing the MACD with a higher peak much lower in the channel per my illustration. I am always trying to learn. Thanks again!

2. technical - missed out the htf support zone and trend line with divergence. however price is approaching a supply zone.

So I took this trade last night, based on the above post I drew the channel wrong.  Below is the chart that I used to enter, I took 1/3 off at the TP1, then there was a nice reaction at the .236 so I was going to move my SL lower and ride is down to TP3.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So while waiting for this to hit TP3 I see Seysin's post and realize I probably built this channel incorrectly, and if my redraw is correct then it hit TP2 perfectly and I should get out.  So I closed my trade in profit.

I hope I drew the 2nd one right, I think I did, seems like closing it was the right choice.

first of all i do not trade pairs like eurgbp, and the other one is audnzdcad.

i am trying to make sense of what happened in eurgbp and would like to share on mtf MA cross (8/21 ema) and fractals.

1. w1 ema 8 above 21. 21 point slightly up with hh hl. possible hidden divergence forming.

2. d1 ranging. ema twisting.

3. h4 ema 8 below 21. but 21 flat with no lh ll. 8 pointing up and price above it.

4. h1 when price closed above trend line. ema 8 below 21. but 21 flat. 8 pointing up and price above it.

regular divergence forming. good for exiting short trades.

5. m15 when price broke up above fractal high then the channel, volume was increasing.

regular divergence formed. ema 8 above 21. 21 pointing up and price above 8. macd above zero.

so it would be good that fcp channel only be drawn when conditions favor in that particular time frame and tp1 2 3 according to it.

Friends!

I stop publishing here and leave FF. Maybe I will rarely appear here to read what I need. I said everything I wanted to say, but my trade continues. Our main goal in trading is to be consistent. And then even 10p per day will be enough for us. This is my trading philosophy. Those who have spent many years in front of the monitor will understand me. We don't have to live to trade. On the contrary, trade should help us in life. If we spend many hours sitting in front of the monitor, we lose another part of our life. This is our family, friends, communication, sun, sky and movement. I wish everyone here all the best. Thank you friends. Take care of yourself and loved ones.

Hey Seysin,

In the off chance you are still monitoring this thread I have a question for you.

I have been working the FCP with success for the past couple of months and have noticed that if I move the time frames around to find the volume candle out of the channel the model seems to work.  For example if I am looking at a setup on the M15 but the volume candle out of the channel is not there I move to the M12 and see it clearly, then if the other FCP parameters are there the deal works. I also see many when moving around from the M5 to the M3.

In your opinion is this valid or am I just getting lucky (especially on the M3)?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Imagine that I did not post any information in the archive, this will remove unnecessary thoughts from you.

After all, I don't owe you anything, just like you do me, do you?

I have posted this information in the archive, just as a small addition to the FСP. But people come who have not published a single post in this thread, not a single chart with FСP. Well, you don't need FСP, not a single scalping chart according to your method. And they demand something from me... Friends, this is not done. Please, understand me correctly and not be offended. If I have time, I will open a new thread dedicated to FPDO scalping. And then you will be able to fully prove yourself as a like-minded person. We'll see.

Dude let the man manage his thread however he chooses, he explained his reasons and instead of putting the effort of learning the basic method first you want shortcuts, and those won't get you far in trading (or life) anyway, think about it.

Thank you friend, that's exactly.

Hello community and Seysin32 (Thank you for posting this, looks promising)!

Unforuntaly, I am using a Mac and don't easily have access to mt4 and therefore cannot download the settings easily. Do you mind sharing the fibo levels for the channel and entry/stop/takeprofits for tradingview! Much appreciated.

Would like to backtest/forward test this

--- 帖子 #1508 ---
damn it, there are trillion information in this thread, I have read it, digest it dozen times. You ask question that are the basis of the methods that you can easy find scrolling back... if you can do this simple work, you will just loose money, over and over again, until you do your homework... sorry dude but that is reality, this method is explained with precision you could only dream of... if you cannot find it no one can help you...

oh and btw, the OP dont use MT4 for charting this method, it show how much you read :-)

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
Nice one, congrats for you

Anyhow, I am aware OP doesn't use MT4, however there are some posts where people are using mt4 - from what I gathered, the fib channel levels are 0, .25, .5, 1... Maybe my post was misunderstood, I was simply wanting to confirm the levels before I try it for myself. I never discredited the explanation of the method :-) In fact, I want to thank Seysin32 for writing a nice clear method with many examples! Afterall, this is a community of sharing and learning.. Happy trading and hope you keep reading through the posts :-)

it took me one hour to refresh my memory by reading post#1 and every links in it.

but it will take years to build up knowledge and experience.

from post #1.

"First, the money is brought not by the system itself, but by experience and knowledge. Secondly, it is not completely free. You will pay for it with your diligence, discipline and hours of training in front of your monitor. He, who is ready to make an effort, will receive the result.

The FCP system is based on a graphic display of the psychology of market participants, expressed in the interaction of prices with TL and Fibonacci levels. At the heart of FCP is the idea that the price, breaking out of a diagonal/horizontal channel or triangle, travels a distance equal to the projection of the FIBO levels on the channel width. We will start with the FIBO projection from the diagonal channel, built from the trend line, since this is the basis."

in a nutshell, look for impulsive, corrective waves or trend, pullback in higher time frame.

look for the same thing in lower time frame ---> break of trend line, channel, support/resistance, pullback, wait for signal candle at specific fibonacci level.

the channel is not permanently fixed, it has to be adjusted accordingly to the later development of price action. eg. the former has been negated because the lowest fractal had been taken out or price had been oscillating many times at the trend line.

the whole thing can be subjective due to further incorporating of our own different knowledge and experiences like moving average, support/resistance, divergences, etc etc .........

1) I connected the trendline as seen between point 1 and 2.

2) Now as for point 3, reading through the posts and examples, I'm aware there is a way to approach it, however, I am still waiting for that 'aha' or lightbulb moment - With practice fingers crossed The way I justified point 3 is with the impulse, however, it has me conflicted with #Post 19 posted by OP..Any way to see it differently/ is it already correct ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1517 ---
pt 3 is ok.

extend the fib ext for tp plus if you want to.

remember the down channel is just a pullback from higher time frame.

Thanks for the feedback.

As for point 3, the confusion I have is when do I put point 3 to the bottom line or the middle line of the fib channel if that makes sense?

For the fib extension, I am using the channel width, should I reconfigure the fib ext values? I'm not sure which one to use as many posts have different ones.

As for the sleep, haha, yes indeed, I'm a late night owl

Nice pullback on the 4H.

Narrowed down to the 30m, but in this case screenshot is on 1H for better visual.

Point 1 and 2 connected as seen with point 3 at an impulse..

Waiting for price to give me a nice pattern candle either at 0.75/0.786 or at 1.

Is this correct?

Edit: Didn't take the trade at 0.75/0.786 when a nice pinbar formed as news was coming out..So far waiting to see if any reaction off the 1.

--- 帖子 #1524 ---
my fib ext setting.

pt 3 can be on any of the 4 lines of the fib channel, whether from pt 1 or 2.

the best is trying to touch as many fractals on the lines as per green up arrows.
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post13296826

the placement of pt 3 would also depend on your TP expectations.

the wider the channel, the higher TP you would expect.

In addition, I receive letters, people began to demand access and even accuse me of selling information, etc. Maybe I will open a new thread for the Fibonacci projection for daily opening (FPDO) scalping method. However, since my time is limited, I will be giving information in thread gradually.

Form just a setup perspective of what you have on your chart, the back end of your fibo's are well beyond the 1.618 so this would be a large red flag that your channel is incorrect.  The bottom end of your Fibos are a mess, see below for a FCP setup of Fibo Retracement on TradingView

--- 帖子 #1560 ---
Hey appreciate it, I spoke about this with inthebox in the previous posts, why is my bottom end of my fibo a mess? I have the same as you, just don't have the -0.5, 1.5 and 1.236 (for top of fib).

Entry still remains at 1 or 0.786/0.75 and profit levels at TP1 (0.382), TP2 (0), and TP3 (-0.382)..which remains consistent with OP's fib. By the way this is not a dig, just trying to understand and learn of course

edit: Reflecting on the first part of your post, I see what you mean with the 1.618, appreciate it.

drawing of trend line.

when fractal 2 break, draw trend line from 1 to 3.

you can have outer trend line B, inner trend line A.

when inner trend line breaks, price tend to go for outer trend line, or a fractal.

to be continued .....

--- 帖子 #1570 ---
same application when looking at h1.

only when you are able to draw a trend line, there's a trend only in that particular time frame you are looking at.

there could be a trend in h1 but not h4.

when a trend line is broken, there is no trend yet when no fractal has been broken.

price could range or could go back into the broken trend line.

so that's how one can interpret when there's a trend or range in a particular time frame.

however, drawing FCP is different from drawing a trend line.

--- 帖子 #1571 ---
Appreciate it, I'm going to look back on the charts.

I'm still a unsure about this though. Would the break of fractal 2 be where I placed the green circles and then price closing below the HL fractal (green square) and then coming to retest it?

when 1 is broken, expect price to move to 2.

when 2 is broken, expect price to move to 3.

so it's up to individual to apply FCP around which particular trend line.

I always seem to be on the wrong side of the trade. As silly as it sounds, how do I know which side to put the channel? I personally, when I see a HH,HL,HH etc. for an uptrend or vice versa for a downtrend, I try to go with the trend and only use the channel on the retracement of the HH (in an uptrend). As logical as this sounds, I always seem to be wrong.

Here is my thought on GBPUSD:

I see price in a downward channel approaching a trendline, resistance, and divergence. Ignore price action after the trendline (that was the next day when I woke up).. I will address that below.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Next, I narrow down to the 15m to see price action better. There is a break of the channel which I suppose is a false one and continues going up.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Today: I redrew the channel but now it has passed the trendline, but still has resistance + rsi divergence on the 1H. However now I am conflicted because of the break of the trendline but also on the higher timeframes, the trend seems to have changed to an uptrend (HH,HL,HH)..

What I learned: CHECK THE NEWS. News is revolving now around USD and I was trading EUR/USD.

a. news

b. currency strength

c. begin with D1

i see that you are trading m1, m5. i assume that you are short term day trading.

1. no matter what time frame you are trading in, begin your analysis with d1.

2. d1 trend line tells me it's uptrend. i see nearest support but i can't see any resistance.

3. go to w1 to find resistance. then refine it in d1. there is still room for price to go up to resistance.

even before looking at your analysis, i have done the above. my bias is to buy.

I wanted to take the trade at the engulfing candles off the .75/.78 but saw an overbought condition + a V shape pullback which if I recall, Inthebox said he likes to avoid in a previous post. Therefore, I avoided the trade overall. Thankfully I did  Although I do see you two still profited from the smaller ticktime frames and/or counter trend trade . On to the next trade

I am looking at GBP/USD (waiting for news at 12pm).

Uptrend on D1 - bias is to buy.

Pullback is approaching resistance + trendline + rsi divergence.

ps. I am a little skeptical due to the new strain covid news revolving around U.K, therefore I'll see how it plays out.

Is this a good approach?

edit: Plus strong bullish day for USD so far?

I expected the bounce because of the overall uptrend, trendline and structure support. It is also a QM pattern. I didnt notice the round number though.

mainly was your placement of point 3.

FCP is used to give us as best an entry as possible with the TP. it's only one part of the story.

the more important part is why we sold there?

it looked like the trend was strong and sold on counter trend.

why didn't we sell at a lower level, we could draw a channel there too?

we could, depending how FCP was drawn. however the TP would be lesser, probably not hitting TP2.

reasons:

1. round number 30400.

2. slowing of upward momentum. compare the 2 green arrows. shorter and not as steep.

3. double top.

--- 帖子 #1676 ---
Thanks for the feedback. So that I'm clear, you're stating that point three should have been at the arrow in the image?  If so, is this because this is considered a strong push up?

this is from post #1.

"On the example of uptrend.

Find the last Highest Low (or bottom preceding the last maximum peak). Draw a beam from this point to the left. The first bottom that touches line the will be the second point. You got our trend line. Build the channel so that one of the sides coincides with the TL. Usually we get point 3 by placing a max (min) swing on the midline of the channel, but the best place for the point 3 would be a straight continuous movement as far as possible from point 1 or point 2. Measure the vertical width of the channel and build a FIBO grid equal to this width. When the price leaves the channel, place the FIBO grid so that the line 1.000 passes through the breakdown point of the TL. Lines 0.382 and 0.000 will correspond to our TP. Look for an entry after closing the signal candle at 1.000. SL is usually a few points above the level of 1.000 or extension 1.272."

choose point 3 that has as straight continuous movement whether it is from point 1 or point 2.

so point 3 was at top of the pin bar.

in this example, i do not consider it a strong move up as it could not close above the previous high.

sometimes it could be a strong move over the previous high which may resulted as an exhausted move to take out retail stops.

or it could result in trend continuation.

your FCP 3 points were misplaced.

you need to reread post #1 and all the links in order to establish a proper foundation of drawing the channel.

Hello and welcome!

I am also in the process of learning (nearly 1 month) and thankful to Inthebox and Seysin32 for continuous teaching and mentoring when they can.

Looking back on your posts, the best way, at least for me is through trial and error and chart time - however of course understanding the fundementals of the strategy which can be found on the first few pages of this thread with further examples throughout. For me, a recent help was on page 83 - specifically Inthebox comments!

Goodluck and a happy new year

As we come to the end of year, this is my demo account results for FCP. I started on 16th of December 2020 with possibly skewed results in the first week trying to grasp the idea and continuously learning. This is not a full month and was only 9 trading days.

However, the idea remains that I will forward test this continuously after the New Years for a least a couple of months and see if I can improve.

Today I had a bad trading day for whatever reason losing 5 trades (5%) and winning one (0.84%, took 2/3 off to let position run but 1/3 got stopped out) - Possibly due to 'revenge' trading perhaps but goals will be set: for example max 2% loss per day etc..I would also like to improve win rate + RR. I usually don't like to monitor the trade and usually set a take-profit. However, I guess I will see when I have done 100+ trades.

Was at one point as high as 10%+ and gave it back but still in the positive at 4.7% on the account.

Lets see for next year and see if I can get the consistency Any suggestions, comparables, or words of wisdom would be great

Using the midline for point 3 or the outer trend line is what's hanging me up.  Sometimes it's one, sometimes it's the other.  While not having the best grasp of this part yet, I still came out with positive points after my first two days trading this method.  I think I took 7 total trades.  Will keep plugging away.

As for the reference to page 83 - there is no page 83.  Please advise.

Looking back on this, nice explanation!

I don’t feel fully comfortable with taking counter trend trades at this time until I fully familiarise myself with the strategy and trending following.

If I understand well, You are suggesting that the less steep the angle of the channel, the higher chance of price reaching take profits?

--- 帖子 #1704 ---
the thing is always look for trend pullback.

this way one is not in a hurry to trade and have enough time to think.

fear of missing out can often make us regret later.

the question to ask is pullback to what level?

nobody knows. will depend on individual's experience.

but we can look for:

support/resistance, round number, trend line, fibonacci, etc .....

so choose a level to wait and see how price is reacting around the chosen level.

in the example,

if one had chosen the round number in confluence with resistance and fib 61.8 as the level to wait, then it had the best reward with the pin bar as signal.

if we missed that level, there are other levels to wait at.

what's the clues or footprints left behind by price?

compare the yellow arrows. the first compared with the rests. the length, the angle ....

compare the length of green line heights from fractal high to fractal high.

see the lower high lower low forming.

not fool proof, but frequently we failed to observe all these tell tale signs (me included).

Hi brother. Sorry for late answer. It was a matter of the magnitude of the downtrend correction, as you can see, this level limited this correction.

Hey Seysin,

Looks like the trigger candle (one with the circle on top) closes it is already at TP1. When that happens do you usually expect it to get to another level?  How do you manage your position in this instance?

--- 帖子 #1740 ---
Hello!

Yes, as I wrote earlier, on m1 we get broader targets TP3, TP4, etc.

I put SL behind the trigger-line on which the candlestick appeared, or behind the local Hi/Lo if it is not far away.

As you can see, the next deal went against me. And I went out with a loss in two parts. I assumed the possibility of such a scenario,

since m15 gave the opposite signal, but I was based on larger timeframes, it was not good for scalping. From m1 no need to go further than m30-m15.

In any case, we continue.

Hi I’ve started to follow this method and trying to trade accordingly but I have few questions

what moving average are you using on H1? I can’t find the post anymore (only the one in first post but referring to m1-5)

At which point you open trade? When it cross live? Or if candle close under (upper) the TL? Or at the retrace to the price exited the channel?

thank you very much

--- 帖子 #1784 ---
Hello.

The moving average is just an addition to the general FCP pattern.

I believe that they cannot be the basis for making decisions (although many use them that way).

On higher charts, MAs show me the general direction, on lower timeframes - the current situation.

Now, I use 48 LWMA for H1. Look for signal candles at trigger levels, but before that, you should

already imagine the general situation with the pair you are trading.

Answers to 99% of the questions are in the thread.

Just take your time to learn everything, step by step.

Even if I didn't know how to read, I would be able to

understand everything by looking at examples of charts and deals.

What you did is similar to the Sperandeo method. maybe it is. but mostly it gives successful results.http://www.chrisperruna.com/wp-conte..._clhb_wkly.png

--- 帖子 #1794 ---
As I understand it, the Seysin32 method gives us a previous entry to the Sperandeo method, since according to the graph that it showed we would have to wait for the break of point 3. With FCP we would already be entering the beginning of point 1 or 2.

It may be a good option for the FCP entry continuation. But come on, it's no longer about FCP.

--- 帖子 #1795 ---
Hello everybody.

I have read the entire thread and I can only thank Seysin32 for sharing the system and knowledge, as well as in teh box for its multiple examples and application of price action with FCP, which makes the system become our favor with the added value.

I will try to implement what I have learned, and I will ask any doubts that arise, hoping that they still come to the forum on occasions.

Thanks

It's important to understand the logic. If you understand the logic, you can interpret it from your point of view. Maybe what looks 9 to you may look like 6 to me. So understand the logic of the system you will learn.

--- 帖子 #1797 ---
Hello.

Since then, I have practiced a lot.

I feel that FCP is even more wonderful than before.

Thanks to Seishin32 and everyone.

After trying to understand all the points in the system, last night I saw a chart where I could open positions.

Resistance in D1, downward trend in H1 and I opened in m5, with bearish divergence and respecting the price levels of the channel and fibo.

Any advice or retification is appreciated.

now is not a good time to trade.

just to see how it develop.

usdjpy htf uptrend, so looking to buy.

before price crossing the trend line, there was a hidden divergence.

--- 帖子 #1800 ---
let's be honest.

to those who is new to this method would have tried but failed many times, then gave up.

can you tell me why line 2 works better than line 1?

yesterday whole day was up until new york session.

watching

news turned things to upside.

--- 帖子 #1804 ---
Viewing only that graph in m15 ...

Less vertical angle of LT, width of the channel more proportionate to the bearish movement, engulfing candle close to round price, there are no touches to the LT between point 1 and 2.

It will be interesting to know your opinion, as this is repeated many times before making a price turn.

--- 帖子 #1805 ---
I see that I entered when breaking LT, but the price did not enter LT2, since when breaking it continues to fall without showing upward force or retracement to 100.0.

Wouldn't it have been better to wait and move the LT to the next min / max that occurred, expecting some rollback to the entry points?

--- 帖子 #1806 ---
on hindsight, all 3 trend lines are workable on certain conditions, one of which is by placing SL below the round number. price testing the trend lines, not going below them.

if solely looking only at m15, some would like to have tight SL not mind trying again later on. the larger profit will cover the smaller loss.

what i want to emphasize is to get as many confluence reasons as possible and checking the higher time frames.

in this example, just by looking at W1 and D1 candles and drawing horizontal lines from their highs lows. Aren't they not support resistance in lower time frames?

one will see from W1 candle that there was a fake out.

now will see whether the top is a fake out after a period of testing.

it's the key level location that is more important rather than trading upon seeing every channel breakout.

--- 帖子 #1807 ---
But I understand that the SL we do not adjust to the FCP, but we would look for an SL based on the key point or round number, as well as looking for a higher ratio to compensate for losses?

The greatest possible confluence is what gives us an important advantage in our favor.

Another query, we use regular divergences as one more point in our favor, but hidden divergences also seem to work very well with FCP, we would always go in favor of trend, I will try to test it.

--- 帖子 #1808 ---
my preference for SL (not a hard stop) is a strong zone of support resistance (confluence with round number and/or trend line and/or fibo).

one can also consider the fcp fib 127/161 zone.

regular divergence is for reversal and hidden divergence is for trend continuation, at times they appear one after another which is better.

i use macd for divergence, and if it also appear in the histogram, it is better.

--- 帖子 #1809 ---
But if the SL we take it to the 127-161 zone, then it does not use the TP1 or TP2 in a fixed way?.

I will try to find some confluences as it says in the box: S / R in htf, follow high timeframe trends, divergences and candle retracements at key points. If with that we get an acceptable percentage and the R / B is positive, in the long term it could be enough.

As Seysin32 says, keep it simple and calm head

--- 帖子 #1810 ---
This last sentence made my day. Very necessary to calm the head

--- 帖子 #1811 ---
i do not know whether you understand SL at 127-161 zone, so i illustrate with a chart.

previously i mentioned to watch out W1 top wick at 110.191.

this new thread may add to your knowledge for those who want to learn more.

one can use it to adapt to FCP trading. not discussing here though.

Let's see how the EURUSD starts the week.

It is not the best situation because it is bullish, but it breaks LT, microstructure, divegence, strong candle at the entry point with rejection, respecting the channel quite well.

The timeframe could be lowered to look for a hypothetical setback if the break is confirmed. But in demo account and to see it in real ...

It could have been entered before with FCP (orange line), but at the current point is when I have seen it.

How do the experts see it?

--- 帖子 #1815 ---
no clear view at the moment because price is at circled juncture.

maybe europe session can tell more.

divergences show both up and down.

if bias is down, beware of lower support zone.

if bias is up, wait for trend line breakout and retest.

tp.

rn 1.2150 as support.

Any suggestions on how to backtest this system?  Some of the criteria is subjective. Not a commentary wether or not to use the system, I just want to make a backtest with the least amount of variables possible.

--- 帖子 #1818 ---
No suggestions. This system is not intended for backtesting in order to find the Grail, it is intended for trading.

And what makes it profitable is the subjectivity of an experienced trader.

--- 帖子 #1819 ---
When you have to fight with the market, and also with the broker ...

Entry in 100 and 0.75 of the fibo, with operation in favor, but at the beginning of the Asian session ... some broker puts a spread of 20 pips (200 tics).

does anyone do gold....

--- 帖子 #1826 ---
I learned about it for the first time today.

I won three in a row. GOLD M5

Great method, thank you.

Are the brothers continuing?

Question.

TP1.2.3.4.5 What are the numbers?

The numbers in the image are as follows

Can this be used up to M15?　H1.H4 ok？？

TP1 38.2

TP2 100

TP3 -38.2

TP4 -100

TP5 -161.8

Is this one wrong?

TP1 38.２

TP2 100

TP3 127.2

TP4 161.8

TP5 200

I'm reading and learning from all the posts.

My native language is not English.

I sometimes don't know how to interpret

I use Google Translate.

Which of the two images do you think is more suitable?

April 26, GOLD M5

The range of Fibo 100-0 is

the same width as the width of the channel.

Am I correct?

If you do not go to the TL,

How do you make the decision to quit?

please treat me well　　Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1828 ---
it was a long time ago.

my memory may not be accurate.

normally it is just a trend line break method.

the fib channel is added so that there is some kind of measurement using fibonacci to gauge how far price can travel.

be it fib 0, 150, 200 ........

the larger the fib the more difficult to TP.

when drawing the fib channel, see that no price should be touching or below the trend line between the 2 points.

when price closed below the trend line, note the last fractal high before the drop.

this is circled in red.

you can then place place the fib channel mid point line A at the fractal.

if the distance from the fib mid line to the trend line is too wide, you can use the top fib channel line B to place on the fractal.

this will make the fibonacci extension smaller.

so you have a choice of putting the fib mid line or the outer line on fractal high.

you have to make your own decision to see whether the fib extension 0 or 150 etc is reachable or not.

range of fib 100-0 is the same as fib channel.

i would advise that when price break the trend line, make sure there is also a break of fractal structure.

you then can take entry around fib 100 or 79 on retracement.

after price got to fib 50, you may want to protect the trade to BE.

--- 帖子 #1829 ---
following daily up trend.

gold broke up trend line and retraced to trend line with support.

candle wicks bounced with higher lows.

tp around fib 50 and resistance.

--- 帖子 #1830 ---
Thanks for the reply with pictures.

I will refer to it and practice.

--- 帖子 #1831 ---
Hello sir, I would like to ask, are you still using this strategy until now? and does this strategy still work and give good profit? I really hope you can respond to me, thank you.

--- 帖子 #1832 ---
It reminds me of a fractal strategy. Exiting the channel (or breaking the trend line). Fractal 123 is higher than the significant fractal in the channel. We are building Fibo. The first target is 76.4, the second after breaking 100 is 176.4
