Super Carry Trade Trading System Greetings to all. I have posted a few trading systems here before, my reason for doing so is for others to critique and improve them. This is my latest, which I have been using on a live account, in a modified version since the first of 2008. This system has been producing for me between 8 and 10% profits per month, or approximately 100% per year or greater, depending on market conditions. I got the idea from Oanda “beginner” forum from “Knightrider” who has doubled his account yearly for the past 2 years. I do “average in”, which some people do not like, but the actual trading aspect of this system helps to mitigate against any negative affects of “cost averaging” the entry. Please examine and critique/offer suggestions as able. GPB/JPY Long trades only (interest positive) Use 0.5% of your Net Available Balance on each trade (Oanda does this automatically) 1.Enter at any time with a market order 2.Place limit orders (long) at 10 pips above initial entry 3.Place 10 pip profit targets on all limit orders, up to 200-400 pips above current market 4.If market drops (carry trade unwinds) by 200 pips enter a market order once per day, with no take profit, in an attempt to lower the average price of all orders to within 100-200 of current market. Each additional market order lowers the “average” of your orders. 5.Enter limit orders (long) at 10 pips above this market order, up to the orders already entered. 6.At any time you have more than 1 order open, and the market is above the average price, close all orders (Oanda makes this easy to do). 7.If market continues to drop, continue to place orders (as in numbers 4-6 above), attempting to keep the “average price” within 100-200 pips of current price. Pros: · Effective in all market conditions (ranging, trending). · Provides profits from both trading and interest. · Only monitor the markets once or twice per day, as desired. Cons: · Caution is needed during carry trade unwinds. If need be, during severe unwinds, limit further buying to only 400-500 pip drops.

Could you please elaborate further. What do you mean by : 2.Place limit orders (long) at 10 pips above initial entry 3.Place 10 pip profit targets on all limit orders, up to 200-400 pips above current market Thanks Does it mean that you place limit orders in 10 pip increments upto 200-400 pips?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
This looks very interesting. A big change in perspective from most of what we see around here. Thanks for sharing. You give a good overall account of performance over the last couple of years. Could you estimate what are the typical and largest drawdowns you've seen? What was the largest number of open positions you've had to carry? All this assumes you are risking .05 on each position. We've had some super volital negative trending months. If anything was going to kill this system you'd think it would have been that. So if you are keeping head above water even with all of this running on, and you system hasn't foreced you into an over-leveraged position, is sounds great.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Sure. This means that you place a limit order to buy at 10 pips above your entry, and you place 10 pip profit targets on each of these orders. You place these orders up to 200-400 pips above the current market price, or even higher if you would like. Your objective is to take profit and lock it in on all these orders as the market moves up. One time I entered my limit orders up to 200 above the current market price, and when I got home from work discovered that the high went well above the last order, it actually went up nearly 400 before dropping back down. I missed all that profit from my last order at 200 above market price to 400 above. Now I usually place orders up to 400 pips above in case of a nice trend or spike. Does that answer your question?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi Qman, thanks for posting. It would be helpful for you to read Knightriders strategy over at the Oanda forums, as he answers your above questions well. For the past 2 years he has had a max drawdown of 11% (if my memory serves me correctly), and that is through all the horrible carry trade unwinds of the past 2 months. He also states his max number of orders has been somewhere around 22. He also uses this system not just on GBP/JPY but also on USD/JPY, and he does not use .05% he uses 1%. Whereas I utilize only GBP/JPY and .05%, in addition to the profitable trading activity that I have added. I have gone more conservative as I do not have his experience. Also, I believe he is missing out on all the profit by utilizing a carry-trade only approach. So I have hope to not get as much draw-down as he does, and have quite a bit more profit. This has indeed been the case for these past 2 weeks.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Interesting. Have you thought about making this into an EA?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
No, I have not thought of making it into an EA, I guess because I get nervous watching a computer do my trading . Seriously, this is easy enough to do, just watching the charts once or twice a day if you can, that I really don't think an EA is needed, at least for myself.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I'm already thinking of a new wrinkle on this. What if you reestablish your limit orders is the price returns to cross your original entry point. So, for example. You place your market order. Price advances to, say, +54. So it gives you 5 clear profit points. Then it retreats and crosses below your original entry. At that point you reestablish all the profit points above. Should the market return to hit those, you stand to make more profit. If it sits in a range you could make profit on your first +10 buy stop repeatedly. The only thing that spooks me is that for every reversal there is a position left open up near the top. I'm still playing with all of this in my head, but I think my wrinkle does present a problem in that it will tend to leave even more of these stranded opens in place. It could work well if price finally breaks through and allows you to close them. But if you bounce around on the top for a day and then fall off a cliff, I guess I'd strand possibly WAY too many top positions. ... So I might have just talked myself out of this. But maybe it will stimulate thought for someone else. Meanwhile, I'm PMing an EA programmer to take a look at this. I'd be willing to pay his $50 fee for an EA on this... but maybe he'll find it interesting enough to want to do it pro-bono. We'll see.

QMan, this is exactly why I do not do this. You will end up with so many danglers that you could quickly be looking at a margin call. I have designed this to avoid those danglers, and only leave them every couple hundred pips or so in a down trend. Do many danglers left when the carry trade unwinds and you'll lose your account.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
QMAN, I've been beating this around my head also. If you buy at 10 pip intervals with 20 pip profit, if market turns south worse case you would have 2 open positions. If at 200 pip turn south you open 1 or 2 more long positions, depending on how may you have open then start over with 10 pip buys from that point. You average cost has been cut in half, roughly, when overall position moves to break even or small profit dump and start over. On large moves south this could add up. At some point maybe put in hedge trade? I think with all the smart people in this forum this could work. Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Just be very very EXTREMELY cautious about leaving danglers. I designed this system to avoid those. they will kill your account.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Dreamliner, there is no doubt you were being very SMART when you thought that through. Out of curiosity, what broker are you running this through, and what is their average spread?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Oanda is perfect for this system in that they show your "average position" right on the chart; makes it so easy. Additionally they have "one click" to close all positions. Finally they're spreads are very low: GPY/JPY is between 4.5 and 7 most of the time.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hayseed! I see you lurking out there. I thought about asking you to look at this for an EA, but you seemed really busy on another thread, so I invited someone else to take a look at this. But he hasn't shown up yet. If you've got the time to work on this, I think I'll be able to thank you for my early retirement...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
By the way, here is the original method that I have built mine from: FXKnightRider's post . The difference of course is that my drawdown is less and profit is more. I did read just now that his max drawdown has been 13%, not 11 like I originally wrote.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
hey dreamliner.... seems like an easy to code ea, and with the number of orders being placed , a ea might elivate some of the potential in the heat of the moment typing errors.... couple questions..... your mentioning 'limit' orders, many grid style systems use 'stop' orders.... is the buystop what your refering to.... in number 6, you mention close all when the market price is above the average price..... this must only apply after the 200 pip drop, correct...... and just noticed you posted a link while i was typing, i'll take a run over there and scratch around for so answers to other questions.....h

--- 帖子 #17 ---
hayseed, as I said I'm not into EA's but if you'd like to develop one that certainly would be fine. In answer to your question, I hate to say it but I've been trading for 4 years and I still cannot really understand limit orders/buystop orders, I just can't seem to understand the definition of them and the difference of them. What I am talking about is placing orders ABOVE the current market. On Oanda there are only "market" orders and "limit" orders. So I used the word "limit" to indicate that the order is placed above the market and when the market raises to the price of the limit order the order is triggered. In answer to your second question: YES! The main reason we are closing out when current market is above the average position is to remove danglers thereby eliminating risk (trust me, you look at those danglers during a carry trade unwind and you can't wait to get rid of them). One other thing to keep in mind, that I'm not sure you can program an EA to do, is that we are always placing orders with .05% of current NAV. That means that as the market sinks our NAV lowers with it. I don't know much about EAs but that is something to consider.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
HURRAY for Hayseed. Thank you man. If you decide to do this, please consider some messages, like the total number of open positions, and the average price. I anticipate that once people start running this there will be speculation about the best time of day to initiate and adjust positions -- So you might want to consider making that user selectable and get ahead of that curve. It may make a difference and is probably worth testing, but in the long run I suspect it is only in the margins... If it isn't though, that will be very interesting indeed. Thanks Hayseed.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
You guys and your EA's, sheesh! Whatever happened to old fashioned trading . Anyway, you are right that it is all in the margins. In essence, this method is a modified martingale method, and every trader alive ought to hate martingaling. A martinagle is the opposite of a stop loss, it is an "increase loss" method of trading. However, what I have tried to do is minimize the effect of it, but the reality is that if the carry trade unwound, and I mean really unwound, we would be out. It is just that of all the unwinds I have seen there are always retracements, and that is where we can stay in, depending on margins.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
The ultimate unwind on these intrest rate extreme pairs is tied exactly to that... the interest rate spread. As long as that is in place I don't think we would see anything dramatic enough to make a complete melt down in our accounts (cross my fingers and pray never to see it...). One should watch the interest rate adjustments between the two (and not necessarily only GJ), and leave when it stops being -- I don't know -- in the top 4? When/if that happens, find whatever is more favorable. Let the interest rates lead you out of the pair and into another. I think if we do that we'll probably be okay. And since those kinds of moves are unlikely to happen literally over night, I think it is pretty safe. But if it happens, a good trader wouldn't be married to the pair just because it has yielded a fortune in the last 2 or 3 or 10 years, ... whatever. The neatest thing about this method is that it is in keeping with my ideal state. No bias on what the market wants to do. No guessing. Because it really doesn't matter what I think the market SHOULD be doing. The only thing that matters is what is happening. And then just go with it. Don't fight it. The second you say to yourself the market is wrong you just pulled the trigger on the gun you pointed in your mouth. The market is NEVER wrong. It is also NEVER right. It is a market. Lots of influencers, but no single entity controls. And if you doubt it, then remember... The Bank of England vs George Soros. BOE was betting they could control their own currency. Result: Soros meets a billion dollar pay day. He is hardly my hero, but he knew when the other guy got too smart for their own good, and he wasn't afraid to go with the market, even if it put him at odds with the biggest guy on the block. This system helps take the emotion out. Personally, that is exactly what I need.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Lots of good wisdom here, Qman! Yes, there is lots of good in this system, better than any I have tried before. Just be very careful not to get overleveraged, that is the main drawback.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Here is an EA I coded with the help of a number of great coder friends, especially Ben Nachtrieb . I got the name for the EA, Aphids, from the movie The Aviator. The EA is coded to manage trades near the close of the day, 3:00PM EST, before swap is paid at 5:00PM EST. The only difference between this EA and Dreamliners version is that this EA does not use Buy Stops. You will always have 1 or more trades opened with this strat. When you first put the EA on the chart it will open a Buy trade and then at 3:00PM EST it will do one of three things: 1. If in profit &gt; 0 pips it will close in profit and open a new buy trade. 2. If -100 pips or greater open an additional buy trade (average-in). 3. If not in profit &gt; 0 pips and not -100 and greater then do nothing and re-evaluate the next day. I have been testing Aphids (carry trade strat.) since Dec. '06 and have a lot of expeirence with this strat., but would like to hear your ideas and input. One of the major lessons learned during most recent carry unwind of August '07 is to hedge all open buy trades once in equity DD of 15 - 18%, because you can't survive these type of massive unwinds like the August '07 unwind unless you have mucho dollars. Account leverage is very important with averaging-in strats. I would suggest to use 0.02 nano lots ($0.02 cents per trade) on a 1K mini acct. (IBFX). On a 10K standard acct. (IBFX) I would suggest 0.02 micro lots ($0.20 cents per trade). Edit: Enclosed you will find a backtest results from Jan. 07 to current. Backtesting Period: 01/01/2007-02/14/2008 Begining Balance: $1,000 Net Profit: $332.69 (33.26%) Profit Trades: 75.4% Absolute Drawdown: $102.80 (10.28%) Maximal Drawdown: $417.48 (31.62%) TimeFreedom

hey timefreedom..... have seen you around on some of the other forums, thanks for the ea here.... a big thanks indeed.... personaly i've never focused on the interest.... it always seemed such a very small part of the very large risk forex has to offer.... interest paid on mini lots seemed mini interest...... perhaps i need to look further..... just gave your ea a spin on the eurusd and it beats almost anything i've written todate, not all but most..... but the biggest surprise is your doing it without the use of any indicators at all..... hhhmmmmm..... now thats interesting..... thanks again.....h

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hayseed, I trading through IBFX. The spread on GBPJPY is typically 9 pips. This is significantly different from Dreamliner's OANDA spreads . I'm still trying to determine how that factors with the 10 pip TP. I am considering that it might be better in my case to run with the rules originally put forward in the system he derived from. I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking this. I'm not keen about changing brokers, but the 9 pip thing always stinks. I'll have to run some calculations when I can get to it. But I'm wondering, after you get your EA done for Dreamliner's system, would it be much trouble to adjust it to run the rules of the original method? (No multiple TP orders... Close position each day at a specified time if it is in profit... average in if market moves against... stay in until price exceeds average price, then close all). This is certainly not a demand, just a query. Again, I'm just worried that I'll be paying too much initiating all those positions. Thanks for your consideration.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Oh, and another thought rattled around in my brain this morning. I was wondering, what if we were to base the additional positions on something like 1/2, or 1/3 of the 15 day ATR. That way if the market is zooming down, you will potentially avoid adding one or two positions unnecessarily. And the TP points could similarly be derived on a daily basis. Say 1/20th of the ATR(14). I don't know if any of this would work, but again, if it does, it would be an improvement that is easily handled by the computer -- read, an improvement most easily implemented by an EA. Just thinking about what could make this smarter/more adaptive. I'm getting some ideas here, I just don't have the time to run them through and figure their value. Hopefully later today. But it limited unless/until you can put such things into an EA, as many of you know. Work to get the code in, and only then do you learn the effectiveness or futility of the idea.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
The EA I posted is coded like the original strat. from Oanda thread. I even coded the average price horizontal line onto the chart. Take a look at the EA when you get a chance. No need to re-invent the wheel. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thanks TimeFreedom, you are right. I originally thought there was a limitation to what time the evaluation is done, but you handle that, and so much more very elegantly. Only one question. In the money management area, you have something called Deta, default value of 1000. What is that for? And thank you very much for the EA. Oh, just thought of another thing. Original claim was that this was earning about 8 to 10 percent per month. Looks like the backtest result is "only" 33 percent since last January (2007). Am I misreading something?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Keep in mind that 2007 has been a bad year for carry trading due to the subprime situation and of course the USD is in the dumps. I am amazed at the 33% return in such bad market conditions. You can make 8-10% with this carry strategy, but you will also suffer big DD. Enclosed you will find backtest results using Ryan Jones MM from '97 to '07 for your review. The EA gives you the option to use Ryan Jones Fixed Ratio MM. You will have to do some homework on his Fixed Ratio MM to get a better understanding. I am enclosing a description of his MM for your review. Backtesting Period: 01/01/1997-01/01/2007 Begining Balance: $10,000 Net Profit: $135,615.00 (1356.15%) 135%/year Profit Trades: 78.70% Absolute Drawdown: $3,387.46 (33.87%) Maximal Drawdown: $16,107.92 (68.84%) TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thank you, TimeFreedom, for the information on Ryan's money management.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
hey qman.... timefreedom is probably correct about not reinventing the wheel.... it appears they have spent considerable time coding and testing, so any wrinkles would have long been ironed out.... wheels work best with good traction, so no harm in shopping around for some mud grip tires..... for those rainy market days, if ya know what i mean..... i tend to cut losses quick, so the thought of coding in averaging down never occured to me..... backtests reveal the pro's and con's..... his ea will also work in the standard fashion, ie no averaging down.... so when used in that manner there is absolutely no chance of runaway drawdowns..... setting a realistic stoploss, profit target and lot size pays very well..... very very well.... no doubt, we owe dreamliner and timefreedom a couple cold ones...... here is an 2006 to date eurusd backtest..... and when you consider it's long trades only with no consideration for trend, it makes me shudder to think of the true potential...... studyin on it now......h

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I have never tested E/U, only G/J and A/J. I guess the reason E/U does well is it's long-term trend since 2002 has been long. And of course G/J is primarily traded long and used for carry trading and it's long-term outlook is also long. You may want to take a look at A/J, which is the equivalent of E/U's volatility, but with positive swap. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #32 ---
And I would double this result, or more, with less draw-down, by using the "trading system" approach as well.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Well I finally found some time to compute some comparisions between the original method and Dreamliner's rendition. It certainly isn't a broad test. I only worked out trades for the last 18 trading days. I don't know about the rest of you, but those have been some pretty challanging days, with some steep drops and steady climbs back up. I also didn't factor the Swap payments, which would be additional, but it looks like long term, it wouldn't matter much. Here is why: Original method: Net gain - 500 pips, with 2 positions averaged in and currently waiting for a payoff breakout up. Dreamliner's system: Net gain - 1,330 pips, with 3 positions averaged in and currently waiting for a payoff breakout up.:surprised The original method would have a bigger payoff in Swap because it tends to have more positions open at one time. I thnik during this period Dreamliner's system had a maximum of 8 averaged positions, but it didn't carry them as long (I'll explain this a bit more in a minute). But the other method carried a maximum of 8 averaged positions, but carried them over 8 days. Dreamliner's system has one "weakness" relative to the other system. That is, most of the time, if you place your initial trade, and the market moves in your favor -- only to retrace in the same day -- Then you usually end up stranding 2 positions near the top. Part of this is due to the spread, so if you have a smaller spread there is a smaller possiblity of stranding 2. With the original method, there is no way to strand anything more than your initial position on the first declining day. I factored 9 pips spread, because that is what I commonly see on IBFX. So, I'm not sure what the swap would be, it really depends on your account size etc. But on a pip for pip basis, during this "challanging" trading period, it looks like Dreamliner's system is far superior. The increased winnings more than makes up for halving the percentage at risk from the original (although the original isn't going to park positions right at the top -- so the reduced percentage at risk is justified by the increased risk introduced by this phenomenon). So, I'm pretty convinced this is worth continuing to look at in detail. Thanks to Dreamliner, TimeFreedom, and Hayseed for the ongoing, very interesting discussions.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Im confused over when to add the long limit trades. For example after adding the first market order, prices go up 102 pips. so i would have 10 limit orders with 10 pips profit each. Now i have the original market order and 1 limit order at the top, then prices starting go back down to starting market order price. Do i start setting limit orders again when prices start going back up? From the way i see it, we would be adding more and more orders as prices oscillate up and down. Or do we only add limit orders above your average price?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
TimeFreedom , Thanks for share The EA. but Can you modified the code to add another version [ea]_Aphids ( Short Position ) to get positif swap short from selling USD/TRY &amp; EUR/TRY ? btw selling usd/try &amp; eur/try will get better swap beside gbp/jpy . try demo in ODL for this pairs. Thanks Prasono

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Dreamliner, I don't understand this part of your system. If there were stop losses set, I would understand it. I would trade the correct number of lots, so that if my stop got hit, I would lose only .05% of my balance. What does "use .05% of Net Available Balance" mean? Use how? Let's say your NAB was 10,000. -.05% is $50. Do you mean that we should open a position that requires $50 on margin? If so, what margin ratio are you basing this on? Thanks

--- 帖子 #37 ---
hey qman..... coded in the buystops , both for the intial entry and also for the averaging down entry..... tossing out some thoughts here...... unless it has escaped me, there has been no mention about how long we leave the unfilled buystop orders alive..... without some sort of maintenance they might become excessive....... so i added a function to remove pending buystops at your choice of future time or not at all........ like you mentioned, when dasiy chaining orders in a grid style with them being placed in 10 pip steps with each having a 10 pip profitarget, there will always be 1 or 2 left at the top.... all others, except the inital order, will close on the way to that last order..... it might not help, but there have been studys on the odds of a pair moving 10 pips after moving 10 pips.... with each 10 pip movement the odds decrease that there will be another 10 pips.... my thoughts were to limit the buystop orders to the highest odds only.... or at least to the daily atr.... also, backtests reveal there are certain hours of the day were most movement occurs..... the prime hours vary somewhat with the pair involved..... placing the orders just prior to that time might assure more of the buystops filling and closing..... another thing, isn't swap trippled on wendsdays.... could that be used in any favor..... will let ya know once i'm done cleaning up the code.....h

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Qman, thanks for this backtest, it is helpful. Any chance you could do all of January too? With regard to this statement: This is the very reason I went with .05% as opposed to 1% of NAV. Your backtest here is very helpful, thanks again Qman!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Bill, The best way to understand this is to head on over to Oanda, open a demo account, and in the "preferences" select ".05%" as your default trade size.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I went to Oanda, trying to figure it out. I need some more info from you. The .05% is the amount of your balance used as margin. That depends on the leverage you have selected. Do you know what your leverage is, at Oanda? It can be anywhere from 10:1 up to 40:1.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Autumn, Under your situation below, you would not have the original market order. The original market order also has a take profit associated with it, so you would only have 1 limit order at the top. Now you have one order open. If prices drop 200, then enter a market order with no take profit, so as to try to average down your orders. And add limit orders now.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi Bill, Yes, I use 50:1. You should be able to find that option there.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
That will work out to .03 standard sized lots per $100,000. It can't be traded with a standard account with anyone except Oanda . No other broker allows enough flexibility in selecting lot sizes.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Ah, good to know, thanks Bill!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Am I wrong or isn't this just simple grid trading?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
It certainly does have some elements of grid trading, but it also has elements of carry trading. I wasn't able to really figure out grid trading too well, but this system is very simple.

Initially it was coded to open a trade as soon as the EA is attached to chart, but that was changed. Can't remember why. Should be an easy fix. Worst case scenerio you have to wait for specified trade hour. TimeFreedom

Any specific reason for the GBP/JPY pair (volatility maybe)? or can it also be applied to AUD/JPY?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I think volatility is the biggest reason. I think this system can be applied to any pair; however, I would not personally use it on more than one pair at a time. I actually did use the modified version on 3 pairs at the same time the past month, and couldn't wait to get out as the margin became excessive after awhile. It finally turned and I got out, but it taught me to be more cautious in the future. Also, with Aud/JPY Oanda pays 9.00 per day less interest on standard lot size.

hey mombone.... yes.... it placed the trades at "2", along with the buystop orders..... i've rewrote timefreedoms ea and made some changes that appear worthwhile to me..... i've had several computers running backtests on dreamliners rules and now it appears the unfilled buystop orders need to stand at least 48 hours, possibly 72, during obvious daily upswings..... it will result in a very crowded chart but the end result is very positive..... i've also coded to take into consideration the trend when setting the takeprofit value..... 10 pips is kinda tight..... uses the study i mentioned earlier about the odds of another 10 pips of travel after 10 pips travel..... also coded in a setting for extending "closeall" function.... rather than closing all when the average is at breakeven, we can add 1/2 the daily range or any other value.... bool PriceAboveGood=false; if (MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_BID) &gt;= LtWtAveragePrice() + value * Point ){PriceAboveGood=true;} made some other changes also.... all seem worthwhile......h

--- 帖子 #54 ---
forgot to include this..... here is timefreedoms aphid ea with dreamliners buystops..... the buystop orders will interfere with timefreedoms comments as seen here..... thats a common thing...... those comments contain some very usefull info, so it might be worthwhile to think about moving them to another location..... and of course if your not using the buystops , there is no need to move anything......h

Hey Hayseed, Changed time setting and also got into trades. Thanks. Also looking forward to trying both EA's. More testing before you post? Thoughts on making profit 18 or 19 pips? Thanks Mombone

hey mombone and timefreedom..... my error, meant that as 'here is an image of'..... mostly just to show the possibility of the buystops interefering with the comments..... still making some changes.... coding in a magicnumber generator along with some other ideas..... and yes, the profit settings are separate and individually adjustable for each buystop order.....h

hey dreamliner, with only 0.05% of available capital as trade size, isn't the effect of the "carry trade", the interest, negligible? For example, with $10k in the account, a position is only 130 units .... or am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Well, as a very small example check this out. Early this month I had a micro position in GBPJPY of .03, which was holding $1.50 of my margin. That position was held through the close of the NY session and so it earned swap of 8 cents. That is what I get for holding the position Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or Friday. On Wednesday, they pay out for the weekend as well, so on that day I would receive 24 cents. 8 Cents on $1.50 is 5.33%. 24 Cents on $1.50 is 16%. In a week therefore, I could earn 37.33% of whatever amount I put at risk in margin. So, by my calculation, if you had a $1000 account, and you were taking a 1/2% position (.005), the standard swap earned would be just under 18 cents. For a week the total swap earnings would be about $1.24. If you didn't earn anything but this for a year straight, and didn't increase your trade size at all; your return just from the swap for the year would be $64.71... or a 6.47% return. That beats what I can earn in a bank here. But put that on top of the further winning advantage Dreamliner's system promises, with increasing trade sizes as your account grows (and hence increasing swap earnings) and I think you could end up with a pretty staggering return. In the end, that 6%+ is a bit small compared to what the grid part of this system is going to potentially earn. Still, it is because of the large swap payment that we choose this pair, and expect the market to continue in the direction of the favorable swap from a fundumental standpoint. You would know to move out of this pair when the swap dropped "enough". What is enough? Well, we haven't had that discussion yet. I think it can only be evaluated relative to other major pairs that might be available. Right now on IBFX this pair is the best by far. Next in line is NJ, then AJ, and then GBPUSD. I'm not an expert at this - still learning. So I hope I've gotten this correct, and I hope it helps those reading here understand better. When we get an EA up and running we will be able to backtest and see if a position larger than .005 is likely to blow up our accounts or not. It may be possible to trade with a higher percentage successfully. In the meantime, it is still possible to trade with a higher percentage --- Just realize that you are leaning much more towards gambling (and not very professionally, I might add), not trading.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Dreamliner, I'd love to backtest all of January. Would you please ask my wife to let me do it You see, she doesn't even know I'm fiddling with FOREX. I'm trying to win enough to convince her that I can do it. First I have to convince myself though. But this is why EAs are so important to me. I really need to be able to set and forget, because who knows when I'll have some private time. If I got a full blessing I'd be writing my own EAs, and I'd make my services available to others like Hayseed here. But I just can't get the time alone to make it happen right now. So, I will try to get the rest of January done, but it could literally be a couple of days before I get a chance.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
hello Hayseed, Can you attach your EA please' thank you

hey faust..... still workin on it..... tryin to code out the pain of the august 07 drawdown..... some might say such situations only come along once a year but then so does april 15th..... and hayseeds have such a low tolerance for pain..... just lookin at makes me wanna cry......h

--- 帖子 #64 ---
No problem, Qman, I understand the time crunch and appreciate the backtesting you've done so far. Personally I don't think EA's are the way to become profitable in Forex trading, but everybody has their different methods, and I'm quite sure there are indeed some EA's that are profitable. They just aren't for me right now.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I doubt this drawdown would have been more than 10% with my rules.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Hoef, Good question. If you only have 1 trade open, yes the effect of interest (carry trade) is negligible. However, with this system we can get as many as 20-30 open trades (danglers) which makes the effect of carry trading huge. The point is, we make double digit profits with carrying, we make triple digit gains with the buy stops. Either way is fine.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Right on, Qman! Good thoghts here. I am running right at 100%/year right now with this method. I expect it to increase, of course, as the lot sizes increase with the increasing balance.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Yeah agree ... though I'd like to see some back testing data on that especially since 1% is used before. How many "danglers" do you have on average for the months you been trading this system?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I had nearly 30 at one time, that was the most I've had, but that was the hybrid system I was trading before this. In the other system, I believe Knightrider said he had 22 max. I am being very conservative with .5 percent, I'm sure others would use higher.

This has been one of the most enjoyable threads .. tx! I am a n00b when it comes to automated trading, assuming that what EA is. What platform does that work on, will it work with OANDA too?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
EA's only work on MT-4 brokers, and Oanda is not an MT-4 broker. IBFX is and there are many more that you can find as well. I like Oanda because of small spreads , ease of platform use, and excellent customer support (via live chat).

--- 帖子 #72 ---
ok .. tx! Though your method does requires a lot of order entry :-)

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yes it surely does. It takes me a good 5 minutes each and every day!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I backtested from 07.20.07 to 08.27.07 and as you can see by the chart, we survived by using original carry strategy. Initially we had an unwind starting 07.23.07, which closed above the Avg. Price Line (242.08) on 08.08.07. The second unwind started immediately on 08.08.07 and closed above Avg. Price Line (232.80) on 08.24.07. Edit: You would have incurred an Absolute Drawdown of 213.69 (21%) on $1,000.00 initial deposit during this August '07 unwind. No too bad in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Time Freedom, thanks for this; any chance of seeing what the difference would be with the buy stops, and the .05%?

Waiting for Hayseed's EA to do an extensive backtest comparison. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #77 ---
thank you very much to Dreamliner for this interesting threat, and Timefreedom, for his EA. I'm thinking, may be a 200 ma can be a good filter? only new trades if price is above 200 ma. What are you thinking about?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
hey timefreedom..... a 3200 pip drop in 20 days is a stiff drink.... and your ea survived it with no loss while being long only..... that's a tall order and the very reason i've admired your ea's logic..... it took a while for me to see the thought behind closing all positions when you were at breakeven and then just open a new position.... your chart shows the neccessity of that "close all at breakeven"..... and thank goodness for that brief 2 day breather in that drop, cause without it ,,,,,????...... surviving the drawdown vs avoiding the drawdown , not sure which is better..... sometimes trying to avoid things can work against us...... still studing on it.....h

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Impossible to avoid draw-down entirely. The best we can do is minimize its effects.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
You will lose much profit and will not avoid as much drawdown doing it that way. This morning I have already taken 1% profit on the pull back of the 250 pip drop of GBP/JPY last night, which I would not have taken with a 200 ma filter. Multiply that by several times every week and you have a huge loss in profit and a much larger drawdown.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hayseed, On you test did it include buy stops going up ? If so at what interval and were the danglers averaged in on the way down? Also at 200 pip loss rebuy did you then start buy stops again at that point? As I have said before... Thanks for all you hard work and wisdom Mombone

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Timefreedom, I'm testing your EA with great interest. The logic is very good but I have some suggestions to prevent DD. I.e. we have our position opened at 228.00. The very next day the price is at 226.80, so it opens new long b/c the drop was bigger than 100 pips. Another day at the same time the price is at 226.70. EA opens another long b/c it is more than 100 pips away from the highest open position. This is what could keep av.price too high when carry unwind starts. So I suggest setting an anchor position just on the last opened order and not at the oldest opened order. This provides kind of counter trend incremental opening longs. When a price is lower than yesterday's by 100 or more pips then just open another long. This way our av.price will be lower during unwind and this requires less retracement to be able to reach the av.price and close all positions in positive. This is actually what Dreamliner's method already has. When we have an EA we could even lower DD with diversification of carry trade pairs. (EU, AU, NJ, GCH). One Jen pair is enough to keep the risk as low as possible. Just my two cents, Mark

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Mark, this was one of the reasons I rejected an EA for this method, as I didn't want all the danglers (or "top loading") to happen when the carry trade unwind starts. You have presented an excellent solution here, I was not aware that you could program an EA to do this. Good job!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Danglers should not be figured into avg price. This would keep price way too high

--- 帖子 #85 ---
What would be a good pair to counter gbp/jpy

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Great observation. I thought of the same thing a while back and initially my conclusion was if price never goes below the last opening order we will not open a buy trade and we miss an opportunity to average-in that day? Again, the more we average-in the closer we are to price and of course the flip side is we are also more exposed. I never actually tested this idea to confirm its validity. Maybe our good friend Hayseed can help to code this feature in Aphids? TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Made some coding changes to Aphids to average-in every -100 pips from previous open price and the results are not good. The good is that we average-in more often and keep close to average open price while price is coming down hard, and the bad is when price starts to retrace and is above last open price we do not average-in. I would like the average-in price to move closer to price everyday. Take a look at the 1st chart using original strategy and the 2nd chart using the new concept. I plotted LimeGreen rectangles to show you the days we should have averaged-in to keep us closer to average price. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #88 ---
This is the whole reason behind my purchasing every day that we are below 200 below average.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Question.. Do we rebuy at 200 below last buy or 200 below current average price?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
here's a quick update and some thoughts..... timefreedoms first ea is quite different than his second..... the first ea closed the initial trade often times before a second trade was made so there was a considerable amount of time you were not in the market..... actually that worked quite well..... i've now moved to his second ea..... it makes a trade and keeps a trade always in play...... had to rewrite it to a form that is clear to me..... anyone that has every looked at a complicated ea will probably agree it's better to recode it using terms, functions and in a form we clearly understand...... below are 3 charts.... all are ran on the 01/01/06 to 12/15/07 hourly chart of the gbpjpy..... figured i better get with yalls favorite pair here...... the first chart is timefreedoms ea, second ea, posted..... the drawdown periods are apparent.... maybe you can see "aphids vbeta 01"..... the second chart is my slight modification to it to that ea.... the drawdown periods are still apparent but it paid a fair amount more with almost the same number of trades.... maybe you can see "aphids vbeta 012me"...... now the last is timefreedoms ea rewritten by me with a few changes..... the drawdown periods appear somewhat different here...... maybe you can see "dreamtime"...... and again, the rewriting was purely for my convienence nothing more...... odds are either of his 2 ea's are going to be hard to beat..... and both likely will work on any pair with some slight modifications....... still studying on it.....h and hopefully the charts will post in the order uploaded, if not maybe you can see the ea names....

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Re-buy once per day, when the current price is 200 below the average price of all orders.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Be very careful about "diversification" with other pairs, as often what will happen is each and every pair you are "diversifying" with will be in a drawdown; now all you have done is remove much needed margin. It will become extremely uncomfortable to trade this way when your "diversification" becomes nothing but an anchor.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thats right, lets keep it simple with one pair. You will have your hands full with G/J alone when it decides to unwind. TimeFreedom

As I watch this discussion evolve I feel I should point out that my 3 week back test was based upon evaluation at 3PM EST (Aphid rule), and adding a new position anytime the average position was 100+ &gt; the 3PM EST open. Dreamliner is more definite about 200 &gt; in our evaluations now. Consequently, the number of positions opened in my study would have been significantly fewer. I am not overly fearful of putting on additional positions as outlined in Dreamliners initial plan. I am very impressed with the performance in the face of the August 2-step melt-down. While not as bad as it could possibly get, I think that the fundamentals behind this, while long predicted by some, sort of launched on us (timing wise) out of the blue. When I consider what kind of catastrophy would have to occur to not get a rebound somewhere along the way; and, take this market down even faster; I can't really imagine a scenario where one wouldn't have a chance to sit back and say "I'm taking a timeout". I mean, in August, even steely nerved me with a puny super micro trading fund (that I'm not afraid to blow out for my "hobby" purposes) might have taken a carry trade system offline until I saw that the market better understood what was going on. You see, the fed jumps in at some point and takes a stand against the ocean. Did it stop the market? No, but it slowed it enough for a trader averaging on a carry to get back to even. Now, if after the correction comes, I couldn't get out before the next downturn... I'm gonna stand aside and turn off that EA. Heck, I might even close my positions. My point is, that even running an EA there is time to ponder what is really going on. If you decide it is the disaster of the century, and it is moving against you, and you don't want to play --GET OUT. I'm not looking for an EA that I can turn on and let run through a nuclear holocost that nobody saw comming and 20 years of the aftermath of that. I'm looking for an EA that can handle day to day decision making. It should handle/survive a handful of serious surprises in the year, and it should thrive when those surprises are in my favor. In general I think Forex being a worldwide market, should allow us to get out whenever we feel the need. I don't expect an EA to make the decision to NOT trade for me. I'll do that. When it is on, I want it to handle relatively normal news. August was probably the extreme of what I want an EA to handle... And it would have. There I go rambling again.... sorry.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I appreciate your thoughts. The market also lost 2300 pips from December '07 to February '08, which was a very large drop also. But you can note there were several rallies and recoveries that kept us in. I got in at about 228.00 and now my average is 211.24, having taken much profit during the fall.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hey Dreamline, Quick question on your list of actions: "6.At any time you have more than 1 order open, and the market is above the average price, close all orders ( Oanda makes this easy to do)." Does this apply all the time or after a big drop and a slight recovery? If it applies all the time the position is closed quickly in an uptrending market.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi Hoef, This applies anytime you have more than one order open. Remember that in an uptrending market all you are doing is taking profit at 10 pip intervals, not closing out all orders above average. In other words, say you are just getting started and you enter your first order, a market order long. You have no stop loss. You then enter limit orders (or I guess they are called buy stop orders) at 10 pips above your initial entry, every 10 pips, up to as high as you would like (200-400 pips above the current market price). Each of these orders has a 10 pip profit target. So then let's say the market just goes up and up. It hits all your take profits and you bank the money. Then the market drops and goes to 100 pips below your current average price. Do nothing (still earning daily interest). Then you check the next day and the current price is 150 pips below the average. Do nothing. Then the following day you check and the market is currently 220 pips below average price. Enter another market order with no take profit, effectively lowering your average price. Then enter limit orders with 10 pip profit targets clear up to the price where your other limit orders are. Then the market begins climbing back up and you hit a lot of your limit and take profit orders. Once the current market gets above your average, close all orders and start again. I hope this clarification helps.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
It helps partly .... I currently have a situation where the original order (without take profit) has 82 pips and the one dangler (after taking multiple limits/profits) has -27 pips. The currency is range bound. The average is positive. So should I close all and start again?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
When my equity is in 15 - 18% DD I will turn off the Aphids EA and hedge with a sell order the equivalent of the open buy orders. Once the sell order is +200 pips I put in a SL of BE+100 and once price moves down another +200 pip I move the SL to BE+200, etc... When price retraces it will close out the hedge and I am back in the game again. Sometimes price will close out the hedge and then start to drop and I will have to open the sell hedge trade all over again. This is called discretionary trading and at one point or another we have to step in and make these critical decisions. Note: I need to code this hedging concept into Aphids. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #101 ---
So you currently have 2 orders and the current market price is above average? If so, time to close all and start again.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
That's what I thought but then you close the positions every time there is a small retraction (in my example above -27 pips from the last limit order).

--- 帖子 #103 ---
That's one way it happens; there are many different scenarios that happen. For instance, let's say you open right now again, and the market goes up and up, you won't close at all, you'll just let the limits and take profits do their thing.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Ok last question :-) .... when you close, do you leave your (old) limit orders in place or do you start laying 10pip limits all over again from your new starting position? I am inclined to leave them open and fill the space between the old limit and the new position with new limits

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I leave them open and fill the space between the old limit and the new position with new limits (time is precious ).

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Do any of the EAs follow Dreamliner's rules on the 1st page? If so, would someone be so kind to say which one it is? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hayseed is coding an EA with all of the original rules from Dreamliner, but is adding some twists too. That hasn't been posted yet. The EA that is posted implements the rules for the system that Dreamliner derived his system from. There is a link back to a discussion group on OANDA posted on the first page as well which will lead you to a lengthy discussion about that systems rules.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I learned a lesson today with the huge rise in GBP/JPY. When you put in your buy stop orders, set them to expire in 1 month, rather than a shorter time frame. Fortunately I had done that and was able to take profit all the way from 209.00 to 212.00. Had I set the orders to expire in 48 hours I would not have had the profit orders trigger. Sometimes the market jumps like this and it is best to have the orders in place in case it does. (I'm right now at 132.67% profit per year, if things continue as they are. Of course this number will go up as the balance, and therefore units, increase).

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I note that the interest (swap) rate is positive for GBP/YEN on the Long side. However the current daily and weekly trends appear to be on the short side. Does the dreamliner system take the long term trend into account? Thanks DrZ

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Dreamliner, I have followed this thread since you started it. You have not changed your original rules, right?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
YES. It is all in the thread.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thanks dreamliner, that's almost the same I do for my carry trading. But thanks for your adaptions! I've just added this to my grid trading thread there at Oanda. My starting balance is €10,000, so I use 188 units currently. This is a strategy which works only at Oanda due to the low position sizes... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thus, if the Trend on GBP/YEN is short, but the positive swap is Long, which way to you trade? Go long (expecting a drop) to get positive swaps? Or go short expecting to make more in capgains than you pay in swaps? This is particularly important using dreamliners chosen pair (gbp/yen). Any assistance will be appreciated. DrZ

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Always long, interest positive only. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I see you out there Hayseed. Any news on the EA ? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #116 ---
hey mombone..... hopefully shortly..... ran aground in something i was trying to code so backed off for a day to clear my head..... something is amiss and i can't put my finger on it..... just adding the buystop orders to timefreedoms ea is a snap..... but the complete ea is yet undone..... we also will need to clarify dreamliners first post rule (6) a tad bit further..... h

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Let me give #6 a try here, and Dreamliner can tell me if I've got it wrong. You are in a downtrend and have some number of open positions creating an average entry price. You also have a (large) number of buy stop orders between your last entry, going all the way up in 10 pip increments, to the last one you placed with your initial entry. Price has been trending down, but now reverses and begins heading back to your Average price. Along the way, it crosses the price of your last entry, and you begin to collect the 10 pip buy stops, each of them closing at a 10 pip profit as price advances. At some point, price advances to and actually crosses the Average price. At that point, you should: 1. Open a new base position ... AND... 2. Close all open and pending orders ... AND ... 3. Establish a new grid of buy stop orders with 10 pip TP from the confirmed entry price of your new base position. That is my understanding. In a fast moving market I can see where things could get a bit dicey getting all of that work done as price is speeding on up. There is a chance for a few oddly filled orders, but I don't think it is so much to concern ourselves with. Anything stranded would just factor into a new Average position, and will eventually fill in a quieter market. Given this understanding I can only think of a couple of questions/issues. First is, what is the best order to accomplish the above 3 steps (again, I'm guessing that in the long run it won't make a huge difference). Second is, since we know we will want to delete the grid above the Average price for the multiple positions, why don't we do that anytime we adjust the Average position buy purchasing a newer Average Down position? Say, after making the purchase, determine the actual average price of all your open positions, and delete any grid buy stop orders greater than 10 pips above the average price (So if the market is moving fast, and you have a standing grid order at 2 pips above the Average price, we would keep that one alive until we've finished establishing the new grid price). Then when the new buy stop grid is established, if that one remaining buy stop position hasn't triggered yet, the EA will go back and remove it. I know this is really in the weeds stuff. I've done some programming though, and I know it might help Hayseed see something he might be missing if I can get enough of that detail in. Hayseed, dude! Did you find your missing Right Closing Brackett? What a PAIN. You are an angel for doing this EA. I have an idea what you are up against, and I really appreciate you taking the time to work on this. May you be rewarded 1000 fold!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
No! Trends are not taken into account, because even in long down trends you will notice retracements, and these retracements are where our buy stops give us profits. I have been profitable since starting this system, and GBP/JPY has been in a considerable downtrend since I started.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi Scott! No, the original rules are all the same. I just added that when we place buy stops we should make them valid for as long as possible (1 month at Oanda).

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I don't think smjones and I are disagreeing here, we are simply saying that we enter the market at any time, does not matter what direction it is headed. That is one of the beauties of this system is that we do not have to be forecasters (gamblers), nor do we have to own a crystal ball.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hey Xaron! Great to see you. I'm "mikejody" over at Oanda . I have appreciated your methods there, and am glad to see you adapting this one.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Qman, you have an amazing ability to understand and apply. Very good, all is correct. The only suggestion I would have is to reverse numbers 1 and 2 below. Instead make it like this: 1. Close all open and pending orders ... AND ... 2. Open a new base position ... AND... 3. Establish a new grid of buy stop orders with 10 pip TP from the confirmed entry price of your new base position. That's it, exactly.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Ahhh shucks, Dreamliner... ... I have a good teacher, that's all.

Generally speaking, I find lighter colored shorts work better for me ... oh, umm... sorry, I guess that isn't where you are coming from. I guess I hope you just forgot, and will remember...

do you use the same NAV (.5%) for the 10 pip tp grid trades as you do for the initial and -200 position trades? would you recommend using a larger (or smaller) percentage for these profit targets? DrZ

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I use the same (.5%), but I have considered doubling the buy stop orders to 1%, but haven't gotten around to testing it or thinking through it thoroughly yet. So I have just stuck with the easiest method, but this is certainly something we can consider.

Hey thanks Seeking Light, I appreciate your tired reasoning. I agree that if Armageddon happens many trader's accounts will be blown up, and those of us left won't care much. The risk of Armageddon happening is real, so caution is indeed needed. The thing that, for me at least, mitigates the other risks, is that I have gone back over years and years of charts and noticed that there is always recoveries when the market trends down. If this were not true, if the market sunk like an anchor and never stopped, you are right we would be sunk with the market. But this simply does not happen. Not to say that it couldn't, just that it hasn't. This is much like saying that forecasting which way the market is supposed to go *usually* happens as forecasted, but of course there are times when it doesn't. My belief is that trading is risky, any way you look at it. I don't personally believe this method is *more* risky, and it may be *less* risky in the long run due to ongoing income from swap, take profit engine running full throttle, and positions averaging down with the market. So, if I haven't said it before, let me say it now: this method is not for everybody. It is especially not for the risk averse or those who believe that Armageddon is going to happen on 2.22.2008 just because it has 6 (2's) in it. Thanks for the heads up, SeekingLight!

Dreamliner, In your original posting you had 0.05% of NAV. Hence my follow-on question about the negligible interest. So I guess it is 0.5% NAV?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Ah, so sorry Hoef, the correct size is 0.5 (half of 1 percent). I'll see if I can edit the first post.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Timefreedom Referring to your post #87, 2nd chart. I would suggest not to open new order incrementally on 100 pips drop. You should do like this: - every day at 20:00 GMT - EA checks out the last opened order - if the current price is 100 pips or more lower - then EA opens new long Stick with your rules with the rest. For GJ 100 pips might be to small. I prefer 150 or 200 pips (best would be adjustable option) Thanks for everyone's contribution!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Does the first entry (the market order) has a take profit or left without to average the first dangler ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #136 ---
The very first order, and every order after closing out multiple orders, has a take profit of 10 pips. This first order begins the run up of limit orders and take profits.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
ok 0.5% makes sence. tx!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I love this strategy ! The thing I cannot figure out is about the 1 open order dangling. If you take spread into account wouldn't it happen you have 2 open orders when the price retraces ? This is a simple and well thought out system ! Great work !

--- 帖子 #139 ---
A very interesting strategy indeed! Thanks a lot for sharing. In your opinion, what would be a good alternate pair for this strategy? The reason for my inquiry is the very high spread on that pair with my broker(9 pips).

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Ok, I made my first attempt with this strategy this morning on the G/J. My very first first base trade was entered at 210.27 with the target of 10 pips which was filled and the subsequent buy stops were filled all way up to 211.07. Currently, I have two open trades at 210.97 and 211.07 and the price has retraced to 210.27 at the time of writing. Correct me if I am wrong.. the average price would be 211.02 (210.97+211.07 = 422.04 / 2 = 211.02). The next ideal new base trade would be at 209.02 or below. Right? Will it hurt the averaging strategy if I have two open trades at the top prior retracement? I am not sure how the next base trade without profit target can make up the difference with two prior top open positions? That area is something I have been trying to understand completely. Thanks for sharing this strategy.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
This the way I understand it as well. If 209.02 is filled, then close out all trades when open P/L equals 0 and then start new series of trades.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
The, usually 2, sometimes 1 stranded positions is the cost of collecting pips on the way up to wherever the market stops. If you want to make sure you only have one base position that might get stranded you should consider Timefreedom's Aphid EA method. Now it sounds to me like you are planning on entering an averaged down position at exactly 200 pips below your average. That may be a viable method, but as I understand it, that is more like an optional way of doing things. In the system that gave birth to the one we talk about here, the system's founder says he checks price/positions just once a day, and he isn't real methodical about when he does it. In the Aphid EA, this is a little more structured/codified so that an evaluation is still made only once a day, but it is at a single specific time. In other words, price might go down 500 pips, reverse, and end up being down only 90 pips by the time the review time strikes. Under the Aphid system and the original system, you wouldn't make any adjutment (no average down at all). I don't know how Hayseed is coding this to work in his EA. If it were an option we could backtest and maybe get a feel for whether or not the option for Buy Limit orders at 200 pip increments below the average makes the system better. It might very well be superior, or it might not. In any case, your option would force potentially more averaging calculations, and new grids throughout the day. This could actually force quite a few more stranded positions on the way down. I mean, if you figure for each 200 point drop you have potentially 2 additional stranded positions as price might do a small retrace; your number of open positions on a 1000 pip retracement could be intolerable -- or possibly even break the bank. I'm not saying it isn't worth looking into though. Just be aware that updating once a day has a way of limiting your risk. If the market fall 500 pips, you're potentially going to have significantly more positions at risk than I will with just 1 new averaged down position 500 pips below my 2 high stranded positions. I think if you run through the math in that situation you'll find the once a day method plays in your favor with regard to what your average price is. If you do the calculation with Buy Limit orders every 200 pips, I think this scenario causes you average price to be higher. That won't always be the case. Sometimes your method puts the average closer to the current price. But the more I think on it, the more I believe your method is advantageous in the smaller or quicker recovering drops. Dreamliner's method is advantageous in the longer drawdowns, which are the ones that will kill your account. In an average market your option should be more profitable... but can we guarantee today and or tomorrow will be "an average" market day. You know, you only have to be wrong on that score once, to be out of the game.

still struggling with the advanced ea..... so in an effort to get us all used to what is going on , here is timefreedoms ea with the buystop grids for demo only.... just as a first non trading step toward a finished version.... hopefully everyone understands the risk here ..... couple things..... the spreads will vary, a 10 by 10 grid such as dreamliner suggest might not work with all vendors.... the buystops distances are all setable.... also for obvious reasons you might want the takeprofit settings different at times.... they are setable.... if you think about how a grid is laid out you'll see the default settings equate to an order every 10 pips with a profittarget every 10 pips.... the 'delay' setting is to set the expiration of the buystops..... after 5 days of backtesting on almost every pair, it appears 72 hours is enough.... the setting 'averagevalueincrease' is to bump up the function that closes all orders at breakeven.... it's by default 0, setting it to 10 requires the market to move 10 more pips before the ea closes everything, 20 requires 20 and so on.... if you think about it, you'll see reasoning..... keep in mind, there is a point of diminishing returns so be realistic.... and last, there is a setting saying 'demo only'.... by default it's set to false.... this is to remind us all of the risk ..... set it to true for demo testing.... do not use this in a live trading account.... it's purpose is just to familarize ourselves with the ea to come..... and once again, this thing will place trades so don't use it in a live account....h

--- 帖子 #144 ---
It seems so silly that people would trust the EA while this strategy takes only ten minutes to set up daily manually. Dump the EA and do it like a man and be proud of your effort.

hey fxhound.... pride has nothing to do with it, nor does ego , nor does being a man.....h

Thank you for this trading system Dreamliner. What time(s) of day do you personally check your trades? Thanks, Glen P.S. I saw a post where you mentioned being a flight instructor. What aircraft do you teach, the Dreamliner ?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Good day everybody, I'm very new to this thread, and i will be very happy if any of my seniors could put me through. is there an E.A for this trading system? the one i saw gave a margin call result on strategy testing. I would have paper trade the system but i seems not to get when the carry trade begins. or when exactly do i set the orders! Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Osta, about EAs--see Hayseed's post #90. You can enter the market at any time to begin and check your trades daily any time you want. Review Dreamliner's post #1 for all the rules...it's all there. Glen

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Youe efforts and time are greatly appreciated. Will backtest and report my findings. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hayseed, Thank you for your efforts. You have me very curious now though. This demo EA seems to have all the functionality we have discussed in this forum to date. So, I'm wondering what additional functionality you are seeking to include. I certainly understand if you are too busy working on things to reply, but, now that I've sullied the waters with the question, I'm probably speaking for the masses here.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Hayseed, I will be testing this on a demo account. It looks very interesting. A friend of mine who programs his own ea's wanted to find someway to auto optimize them. He found this link on the mql website and he indicated it has made his ea's become profitable. Not sure if this will help you or not since I am not a programmer. Here is the link. http://articles.mql4.com/506 Jeff

--- 帖子 #153 ---
hey azjeff.... thanks for the link , i'll take a peak..... hey qman..... perhaps it was me that sullied the waters by offering to write an ea when none was requested.... maybe we should start a new thread to further investigate timefreedoms ea..... just as thought..... the " additional functionality " is along the line of drawdown protection but more to the point, drawdown exploitation ..... as seen below, 1k went to 14k in the same 2 years.... this is timefreedoms ea with dreamliners buystops along with the added exploitation code..... there are a large pecentage of trades placed but not filled, far too large a number..... it's those never-to-be-filled orders that are causing the trouble..... we might also look into the number of sunday troubles filled in any gap up..... if the market ever gapped up only to fade back, there might be many buystops filled against us...... not sure..... we also need to limit the lots, once this thing gets a good grip it could go parabolic quickly.... that's a negative..... h

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hayseed, okay, I see where you are going with this. You've not explained what the method is for the drawdown exploitation, but you are probably right -- this may no longer be the right place. Dreamliner, I think this becomes your call at this point. Development beyond what is already here is functionality beyond your original concept. I gather you are not especially interested in an EA beyond what is working so far. If we continue with this here we will be hijacking your thread. Out of deep respect for what you have shared, I wouldn't want to do that. But Hayseed may be onto something even bigger... To find out, we will be talking beyond your original idea. So, do let us know if you want this to continue here under your name, or if you prefer to keep your original plan to remain pristine.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Thanks for sharing this great link. "The main idea is to start optimization of an EA automatically once a day and then analyze the obtained optimization results and record them in the EA's variables". I will do some homework and try and optimize Aphids variable: AddLotsThreshold, which is fixed to -100 pips right now. Dreamliner currently uses -200 pips to add additional lots when price is retracing and I use -100 pips. Maybe -100 pips is best or maybe -200 pips is better. I will run this automated optimizer everyday and I will evaluate what number it suggests for the AddLotsThreshold. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #156 ---
If Dreamliner decides he wants to keep this thread more about his strategy, which is totally understandable, then please count me in to discuss new idea's to optimize Aphids results in a separate thread. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I think this would be a good use for the optomization routine. But I believe we should be shooting for, not is -100 or -200 better... I think it should be more along the lines of, is the current market environment better suited to the use of -75, and tomorrow, will we find that -145 is a better, and next week, when things are rocketing away from us, maybe the optimization will tell us to not add a position until we are -400. That would be taking the power of this to the next level -- along with Hayseeds thought of some trigger to actually (possibly) step into the trend running away from our original position --- Still holding out on that until I know more about the logic in the trigger, and the method of the money and position management. In the end, I'd be really happy knowing that an EA was going to be wise enough to realize the market has fundamentally changed, at least in the near term; and decides it must adjust accordingly. That should effectively minimize our steps in against the trend, and thus lower our average for closing all the averaged positions when we do, as well as reduce the number of stranded positions we have to average (which all boils down to less risk in the system, so I might be able to increase my percentage and my eventual winnings). --- NOT that there is anything wrong with what Dreamliner has given to us. That really looks like a winner to me, and I am in fact collecting pips using it since last Friday.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Greetings friends, I'm happy to watch this thread develop, and so far all I've seen are your great improvements, which is what we are all after. So hijack away, just don't demand a ransom .

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Haysee, I think the looks of this equity curve are amazing. But can you explain why orders placed but never filled are a problem? That shouldn't seem to have anything to do with equity curve or anything else, should it?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
hey dreamliner.... something is causing occasional orders not to be closed but dragged along for months..... timefreedoms ea does not do this , so it must be something in my added code.... possibly in the way i'm counting the orders........ that equity curve is being accomplished by the ea have more to work with than just a time of day.... the orders are being placed with the trend and very few placed for any reason againt the trend..... this 'somewhat' eliminates the need for averaging down.... so the ea has more control over that -100 or -200 entry level.... sometimes it might place orders at -50 and other times it might not place any orders till -300..... also, 10 pips for a profit target is kinda tight..... if the ea chooses the profit levels using something like atr, it should payout better..... as seen in the chart below, many of those orders that dragged down the account at the end of the test were months old..... hundreds of other orders have come and gone but these remaining orders are escaping all attemts to close them.... not sure why..... still studying on it.... this test here is not using the drawdown protection code, so the number of orders is about half..... ie, it's long only....h

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hayseed, I'm not an expert programmer by any means but I was having trouble on my EAs with closing all orders until I made the for-loop count down instead of up...something like this... for(Counter = OrdersTotal()-1; Counter &gt;= 0; Counter--) It's worth a look, I guess. Glen

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hayseed, Had ea up and running. I manually closed all positions then reloaded. It won't open any positions. I even deleted ea and reloaded from scratch but it won't open anything. As far as open orders can ea be programmed to open a new order as soon as one is entered? Say open 10 orders at 10 pip intervals and as lowest order is entered open a new order 100 pips out? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #163 ---
hey glen ...... thanks..... the code i'm using is below.... it works on every other ea i've written, but for some reason a few slip thru here..... it possibly could be a magicnumber issue so thinkin about takin out all references to magicnumber today......h //---------------------------------------------------------------- void CloseLongs(int MagicNumber) { int i = OrdersTotal(); while( CountLongs(MagicNumber) != 0 &amp;&amp; i &gt;= 0 ) { OrderSelect(i,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_TRADES); if( OrderSymbol() != Symbol() || OrderMagicNumber() != MagicNumber ) { i--; continue; } else if(OrderType()==OP_BUY) { OrderCloseReliable(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),Bid,Slippage,ExitLongColor); i--; } } } //----------------------------------------------------------------

--- 帖子 #164 ---
In reference to dreamliners original rules for placing 10 pip profit positions in the direction of the positive swap; has anyone experimented with placing ten pip profit positions in the line of retracements? ie, if I am long GBP/YEN and willing to place another long trade after it has retraced 200 pips it would seem like an opportunity to take some pips on the downside as well as the upside. Since the retrace profit positions would be swaps negative, perhaps using a smaller unit size (less than the %NAV) would be in order. You might also have to use two different brokers since some do not allow you to go long and short on the same pair at the same time. This set up would look very much like an extended straddle/strangle such as we use in options trading. Just wondering if anyone had given this concept any thought/test. DrZ

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hayseed, I'm not going to pretend I know why, but based upon Mombone's post I'm thinking that the issue COULD have something to do with using a WHILE loop instead of a FOR loop. As I said, I don't know WHY that would make a difference here, but it is another way to approach doing this. So, you'd query to find the number of open longs with your magic number, and then run that number through a FOR loop. The really SILLY thing is, I can SEE how using a FOR loop might leave some orders open. So, I would generally agree that WHILE seems the more logical approach. Still... as I learned from someone long ago, if you've tried EVERYTHING to fix your problem, and it still ain't fixed ... check your assumptions. I assume WHILE is the way to go, and you still get problems ... so there is some chance, that is wrong. Again, don't ask me why ... cause I don't know.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
hey mombone.... that ea was timefreedoms first which did not place any trades until the selected hour rolled around..... you can set the hour to next available hour to check.... will check here also..... i chose that "first" ea over the second one out of caution..... had i used the second ea, which placed trades immediately, my fear was someone would place it in a live account..... upon attachment it would place all the trades with no stoploss or profittarget..... they might not realize the trades were placed..... which could be disastrous...... if i follow your "new order" idea, that would be just extending the grid on up..... dreamliner had mentioned running the grid up higher.... i programed it where we can set the grid height just by selecting the number wanted.... so selecting 10 would be 10 buystops, 20 would be 20 and so on.... in obvious up trends it helps..... but you will also have a ton of orders that never get filled if you don't push out the expiration 5 days...... one other thing about buystops...... they are vunerable too gap ups and excessive spreads ..... so if we have alot of buystops close to the market price, a couple second increase in spreads so often seen at news events can inflict alot of damage..... at this point there is no protection for excessive spreads...... we might need to include some......h

--- 帖子 #167 ---
hey mombone..... check your settings and hour to open..... it just placed all orders here as expected.....h

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Changed time to current time and it opened trades. I opened several times yesterdayand it opened traders right away. Also both time yesterday and just now it opens 2 trades close to each other. Yesterday both were 1 pip and just now 2 pips. One trade says "demo only no live trading" and other says "demo only no live trading-GBPJP. Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #169 ---
hey mombone..... not sure of the reason.... just placed it on three pairs and at 3 oclock, all three opened 1 trade each and placed the grid buystops.... you mentioned the other day about deleting the orders..... did you by chance try the "CloseAllOrdersNow" setting in the inputs..... for some reason it is not working for me..... does it work for you..... i went ahead and rewrote it , void CloseorDeleteEverthing(), to include both closing open trades and deleting any pending trades...... that might come in handy if we had 50 pending orders ..... it will step thru them and delete 1 about every couple seconds.....h

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Dreamliner, I'm trading your original rules (post #1) on OANDA . I posted a question a few posts back (you may not have seen it). I'm curious how often you check your trades, once a day at a specific time, or many times a day as your schedule allows, etc?... My work schedule changes every day. One of the beauties of this system is that I don't think it really matters what time of day you check or if it's the same time everyday. Just wondering how you have been doing things. Thanks, Glen

Hi gnllr, No, sorry I did not see your question, I think I may have missed some back a few pages ago. What do you fly? I'm a B-737 Captain out of Cleveland. Anyway, it matters very little what time of day you check this system. I actually do check it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, that's all.

hey bighope.... thanks for those.... the "close all" script is very similar to what i used on the rewrite but just included it in the ea like timefreedoms closing function..... was wonderin, is there a reason for not using extern inputs in your buystop code..... seems that would be easier than modying everyday....... i tried to use almost the exact same while loop as in your buy stop code last year for a couple ea's but never could figure out how to let the user, or ea, independtly adjust the profit target.... backtests on every pair reveals that the ea pays far better when the lower buystops have a larger profittarget..... have you given any thought on how we could vary the profit target and still use that style while loop.... thanks.....h

--- 帖子 #184 ---
hey hayseed ... that "close all" script I took it somewhere or given by someone somewhere sometime ( it might be yours) i can't remember ; big thank you if it's yours. All i did for "close all pending" was added "//" and "break" function. "Buy stop" i took from "send pending" script preinstalled in mt4 platform than do some modification that suit my trading strategies. My programming skill in mt4 is as far as 2 days time and 2 pages of metaquotes web pages on "data types" section (finally found the "double" data type). if this is about driving; I’m still trying to understand which pedal is for braking and you already a race winner. the story behind this tools was because i hate to do those 40 buy stop manually at 00 GMT. Extern input ..... i hope i can do that but i can't. Of course i need to learn a lot from a guru like you. By modifying the script everyday (also shown that i don't know how to do extern input) i can decided what MM strategies should i use that day and also checking do i have enough equity to do something else with my account (actually because is so small). perfection need more effort (hey i just made that words ) That also why i did not do some complicated ea (also the hard fact that i did not know how to do that) Warning !! what I’m about to say is totally nonsense but it might hit something and do the collateral damages. please don't take my word seriously (peace) lowering buy stop = bigger profit target in one of my line in buy stop script ticket=OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUYSTOP,b,e+(d*point),0,0,e+((d+10)*point),"some comment",16384,expiration,Green); d=d+10; variable d is what i aim to change; In my case i use only one variable since i have constant profit but if i need to change my profit base on the where is the bid i certainly will use 2 variable by measure the Bid - lowest low i did find the lot to handle the movement downward in the same manner i can measure let say R1 - Bid or highest high - Bid and divided by some number i found constant variable that i can add up every time the "while" do the profit line. just some wrong line to make my point more confusing int y= 10 in the while int x= (highest_high - bid) /10 if x &gt; 100 , y = 10 if x &gt; 200 , y = 20 etc OP_BUYSTOP,b,e+(d*point),0,0,e+((d+y)*point)........... hey hayseed U done some great ea; a lot of trader very thank full and also great full because of it ; me also (big time);

Can someone explain what the Aphids EA actually does, other than place a buy order at a certain time of the day? I have it running on a demo (just one day) using defaults. It placed an order but didn't place any orders 10 pips above like dreamliners system. If someone has a step by step breakdown of the EA, that would be valuable. I am a coder, but of course, sometimes it's hard to read other's code. This EA is well written, but having a hard time understanding it.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
hey bighope..... hmmmm, you solved my problem..... a very big thank you..... the solution was hiding in clear sight all along but i never saw it till you pointed it out..... //----------------------------------- extern int dd = 100; // highest profittarget with lowest buystop //----------------------------------using your line-------- ticket=OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUYSTOP,b,e+(d*point),0,0,e+(( dd +10)*point),"some comment",16384,expiration,Green); d=d+10; dd=dd * 0.9; // the ea was decide the 0.9 value //--------------------------------------------- that never occurred to me but it will add weight to the profit targets of the first, lowest, buystop orders and slowy increment down as the buystops go up.... the precentage can be determined by the ea with reguards to the current trend.... btw, i'm not a guru..... just a hayseed with a burning desire to understand the mq4...... thanks again......h

As price goes up are we opening buy orders manually? EA only opens 10 buy orders. Thanks all Mombone

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Bhale, I will give you the general concept, but I don't use that EA, so I will not try to give insight to every possible setting. Basically, the EA will stake an initial position at the time the user specifies. It stays in that position throughout the day. At that same specified time the next day, the EA evaluates if the position is in profit or not. If it is in profit it will immediately close the position and open a new base position. If the position is NOT in profit, the EA determines if the price is more than 100 pips (this can be configured to another number by the user) below the base price. If it is, the EA purchases another position and establishes an Average Price. If at anytime the price exceeds the average price, ALL positions are closed, and a new base position is opened. Each day after an Average Price is established, at the evaluation time, the EA will determine if the current price is less than the Average Price by more than the user selected threshold (100 pips in my example). Anytime the average price is greater than the current price by that threshold another averaging position is added. There are options for stoplosses (defaults to 0, meaning not utilized) and an advanced money management option included. I asked a question a very long time ago about the Delta variable and learned it related to the money management function. In that answer TimeFreedom provided a link with more information on how that worked. That should give you the feel for it. As a programmer you should be able to work from that, I hope. The system is used to only take swap positive long positions. There is a Max position variable that is set to 1000 by default. I'm sure you'd go broke long before that... And God help us all if the market gets close to going triple digits on this puppy... lol. Anticipating the question, which IS covered near the begining of this, the max number of open trades at one time, using those original Aphid rules was something like 22 over the last 2 years, including the big unwindings the second half of 2007. Hope that helps.

Hi all, I was considering an alternative to averaging down by set amount (eg. 100 pips) could we use an indicator such as stochastic (or similar) to calculate oversold territory?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I couldn't have explained it any better. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Haven't had a chance to optimize lately. Based on previous research AddLotsThreshold=-100 pips is best. TimeFreedom

Has anyone experimented with doubling-up on the entry order after a 200+ pip drop instead of entering at the same lot size? For example if the 10 pip incremental orders are at 1 lot each, then the entry after a 200 pip drop would be at 2 lots. Walt

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Has anyone been testing the ea? If so how are your results so far

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hey hayseed nice to know my crazy line can help someone. Thank U. Btw extern can not use in script. To all here is an idea ; advance calculator to calculate how big our lot so it can handle all the movements downward. also calculated how big our lot for second position, third, etc. hope it's useful

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi, I use this strategy but with a 20 pips tp. That way you often end up with only one dangler at the top, not two. I don't use market orders, just place stop buy orders above the last low and above the current price... It looks like this: http://www.xaron.net/dl/fx/2008/grid/gbpjpy_270208.png Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Yes, as per Dreamliner's method, the first market order has a TakeProfit of 10 pips as well. Glen

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Xaron, If you set tke profit at 10 pips (or 20), then set the next trade to be 10 plus the spread, you will always open a new trade when the current reaches take profit. Also, you will then have only one dangler. I am using this but not opening up a position that stays on. Just the 10 pip buy stops. That way, ony one danger per day. Also, if the pair has made a nice run up, I won't open any more for the day, but if it goes back down by NY open, then I will enter trades.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
bhale, actually you can have 2 danglers due to the spread. A new position will be opened before the old one is closed. This is more likely for a spacing of 10 pips than for a spacing of 20 pips. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Xaron What time do you place your trades? Looks like your using different times. Please explain.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
here's another buy stop script for MT4 with variable TP function; variable spacing function; and all previous variable functions. with this script you can set your first buy stop order just one point above the bid price or other points your second position 20 point above your first position or some points you desire also set 20 point tp or else for newbies in mt4 please place this script in : C:\Program Files\"your broker mt4 name"\experts\scripts example for interbankfx customers: C:\Program Files\Interbank FX Trader\experts\scripts to modify the variable : just right click the Adv_buy_stop_script in the navigator window in your MT4 change your variables (please check to always have ";" in the end of your variable value ) click compile Please remember this is script not an EA ; hope it's help

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I might be wrong but in that case it is difficult to "close" the orders b/c on a retractment you always left with the danglers. For example if the currency has a sinus pattern (of maybe 200pips top to bottom) you continuously open orders on the bottom and they become danglers on the top of the sinus. Whereas if you leave the initial order open you average down much faster and thus allows you to close the orders when the average is positive. Somebody please confirm whether or not it will work with a 10pips take profit on the initial order

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Usually during London open and until NY open. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hoef, I can confirm that using 10 pip Take Profit on the first market order does work. I'm using OANDA . Dreamliner has been trading this way since the first of the year with good profits. I think the reasoning behind this is the scenario when the price continues to rise, hitting many of the buystop orders. However, you do have a point about having a lower Average Price... Say that we are just starting and we open our first market order with no TP. Then we place our buystops up to 400 pips above the current price. Now the price continues up to 200 pips hitting half of our buystops for profit. Now lets say that the price drops to 100 pips to end the day. Let's assume we have one dangler at the top (the 200 pip point) and our first market order with no TP. Our Average Price would be lower, which is good, and perhaps the current price is even above our Average Price, so that we can close both orders and start again. If the price continues to fall the next day, then we would have, overall, a slightly lower Average Price to work with. All in all, I don't think it makes that big of a difference either way. However, I could be overlooking something that someone else could shed light on. Glen

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Dreamliner, For the purpose of averaging in every 400-500 pips, what would you say is a "severe carry trade unwind", like around the 1000 pip mark or more? Thanks, Glen

--- 帖子 #205 ---
1998 GY dropped 3500 pips in a week, that's rather severe i would say...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
No you won't. It's not possible. If the spread is 3 pips, you place orders 13 pips apart with TP of 10. One will close and the next open at the same time. Never more than 1 dangler.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Yes you are right. But dreamliner uses a tp of 10 _and_ a spacing of 10 as far as I know. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Right, so past 1000 pips on the descent, you would increase your averaging-in spacing from 200 pips to 400-500 pips.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I like your idea. Looks like we might be using it soon...

Here are my eight open trades (Drawdown 3.4%):

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I've been trading this system the last two days with an interesting twist. I am trading the JPY pairs and only when they have gone down a little or a lot by end of day. If it's shot up, I wait. But here is what helped me the past two days without having danglers. When an entry goes against me about 30 or so pips. I adjust my pending orders down. I do this until I have enough orders to get me back to the one that's dangling. If it's close to noon hour, I might then put the dangler at breakeven. I did this today with success. I had 15 TP and then 3 danglers that evened out to breakeven with the last trade. So I got around 150 pips. Yesterday saw about 90, with no danglers. I don't think it will eliminate danglers but it helps keep them few. THe only drawback is having to monitor things, but your not stuck to the screen, just have to be close by.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Bhale, What does "adjust my pending orders down" mean? Are you setting sellstop orders that hedge your danglers, allowing you to close them at breakeven? Could you explain this a little more, maybe post a chart? Thanks, Glen

--- 帖子 #214 ---
This is currently the best forex strategy that I know that is purely price based, uses no optimized lagging indicators, is quite profitable yet low maintenance.

Hello Hayseed, How is your performance going with the latest trading on the ea? Jeff

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I haven't finished reading the whole thread, yet, so this may have already been discussed, but i will finish reading it. Just wanted to get this posted before the thought exits my mind, or i spend 4 hours trying to find this post. The best way to close all the trades that are open at the average Breakeven price, would be have the EA modify the TP on all orders open longer than 24 hours, to the current average price plus 1 or 2 pips every day at the same time. Like 1 hour before we put the days pending buy orders.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
gnlr, On Friday I had a grid on USDJPY starting at 104.27. I had ten entered. It kept moving down so I changed the highest and entered at 103.97, then every 13 pips (10 plus spread). It came back to about 104.35 before dropping again, but it allowed me to get back to even with the original trade and also get about 30 pips. So by adjusting down, I mean moving my buy stop entrie down, so that when it does come back, I am getting some profits while getting back to my original. I know this won't always work, but it makes sense.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Okay, now I understand. Seems reasonable if, like you said, you have the time to monitor the trades more often. Thanks for sharing this idea. Glen

--- 帖子 #219 ---
i'm trying this in a micro account, manually at the moment, don't have enough to play with g/j, so i'm playing with a/j, right now.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
With the recent "volatility" we can see if it makes a big difference between having the base trade with or without a take profit

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Maybe I'm just not following you here. My first long trade before G/J went south was opened at 212.88 (which hit it's TP). My topmost dangler was opened at 213.49. So if my first trade was still open that would be a difference of 61 pips. The average price then would only be about 30 pips lower than it is now, so that to me, doesn't change much. But then again, if there was a 3000 pip drop and the price came back to within 30 pips it would be a big difference....we'll see.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
A fundamental concern with this methodology is the REAL fact that sometimes the currency pair won't recover enough within a reasonable timeframe. The gbpjpy hasn't seen these lows since 2006, and the usdjpy has not seen such bottoms since 2004. That's a long time to be patient and wait for enough of a retracement to get you out of your dangler positions. At some point, perhaps after each 800 - 1000 pip drop, one should double or triple the lot sizes of the low entry. The low entry is the entry without a TP that's opened after a 200 pip drop. I would not double or triple the regualar 10 pip tp entries that follow each low entry. Your thoughts... Walt

--- 帖子 #223 ---
My top dangler is at 213.54 so it is getting interesting :-)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding you... or perhaps you are running with one of the options presented by another contributor. According to the original method, you don't just add a new averaging position each time there is a drop of 200 pips. You add an averaging position each day the current price is more then 200 pips below the current average price. So, in those times where there is a very steep drop, and the retracement doesn't get you out, and you keep dropping... at some point you'll be adding a position almost everyday. Eventually the market will at least take a breather, but you'll still be averaging down. Does this get expensive? You bet! Which is why the money management rule has your exposure at a very meager 1/2 percent. Play with more than that and you better realize you are dancing with the devil. You know, this kind of trade is not for everyone. Some people couldn't stand having 20 or even 30 open positions put on against an obvious prevailing trend. With the right set of conditions this thing certainly could melt down your account. The same could be said for just about any method... The key is, what are the odds of that right set of conditions? What would the rest of the world look like in the midst of those conditions, and would it be something you could recognize your system isn't going to handle, so you can shut it off, cash out, and walk away (admittedly battered) ready to trade another day. Most of the systems I've seen on ForexFactory that can melt down, are insidious, because they depend on a trend. They melt down when there is no trend. That means, if nothing is happening in the world, OR, all the things that are happening in the world are a WASH in the opinion of the marketplece, you are going to get beat up. Do your money management right and you'll probably survive. Get it even a little wrong, or deviate from your system, you'll get hurt. Same, same. Odds of a super long no trend period might seem pretty small. Odds of GJ tanking 3000 pips without looking back?... Not very high I think. Could I be wrong? Absolutely. If I was looking for a sure thing I'd put my money in an insured bank. This is my risk money, though. My risk tolerance is pretty high. Gets me in trouble sometimes. Someone else miight not be able to sleep at night with this system. That is a clear sign that this system is not for them. So far though, there are a significant number of people that have made money with it in a longer term, even through some pretty wild drops. I'd say if you are watching every hourly candle (not that YOU are), this system is probably not good for your style. The original system this is based from was a "Look only once each trading day" system. It works for me so far, but I've only been at it for about a week, really. And I'm still only experimenting. But I see the wisdom. Once this current drawdown pulls back to cover, we'll all have alot more experience running through this drill. For now, I'm sitting tight, watching the number of positions I have increase, and the swap winnings build, and the average getting a little closer to the actual price. The only thing that can make up for a lack of patience is stubbornness. I'm patient to a point, and I can be very stubborn beyond that point. I think this system suits me.... Easy to say as long as I still have money in my account though. Your point is taken. Could be some rough paths. Anyone working this system needs to really know that going in. Panic and you're probably going to ruin the opportunity. But there is opportunity, for sure. Good luck to all.

Group: The question is on reloading BuyStop/10pipTakeProfit positions. Say the market order is at 100 and you place BS/TP at 10 pip intervals up to 300. Now say that all your BS/TP positions are hit and cashed out, but the price falls back to 100 (your original market order position). Would you place a new set of BS/10pTP orders? Anyone doing this? DrZ

--- 帖子 #227 ---
The original plan would say to put your buy stop orders on, and don't let them run out. If price goes up enough, fast enough so that you don't get a position on before they are all gone, you should jump in the market with another group of buy orders as soon as possible. If you have enough orders you will end up leaving something stranded at the top. While these make it painful to carry through the down turn, it is also the main point of the system because they are generating that swap payment each day (X 3 on Wednesdays). The more of those that are open, the bigger your payday. The goal is to always have open long positions. If you wake up someday to find you don't have open long positions, you need to get some on. That said, when you choose to enter can be significant -- but that is a psychological thing really. With proper money management and patience or stubborness, you will make money with this system.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Sorry to keep coming back to the base order with takeprofit or without takeprofit. But I believe that if you do a takeprofit on all base orders, your average position will never be positive (unless is the currency pair is higher than your highest dangler). This is the case because when the currency pair goes up, the takeprofits eliminates the lower trade and effectively replaces it with a trade at 10 pips higher .... that will continue. Am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
No problem. It's good to really know the system and make improvements, if able. Just to be on the same page, we can define some terms: First Trade - The very first trade placed. This has a 10 pip TP. Buystops - Buystop orders placed in 10 pip increments up to 200-400 pips. These have 10 pip TPs. Averaging Down Trades - Trades placed with no TP that help bring down the average price when the current price is below average price by 200 pips (400-500 pips when we have a severe unwind). Danglers - Trades that get stuck open at the top when price reverses (can be any of the three above). When we are able to close out all trades, then we start over with a 'First Trade'. I think when you say 'base trade' you are referring to my 'Averaging Down Trade', which would not have a TP, thus lowering your average price of all open trades. In the event that the price goes up and up, trades are opened and closed in profit, and we don't really care about average price. We concern ourselves with closing above average price when we have two open trades (or more) or when we have 'danglers'. You probably knew most of this but just to clarify... Also, here's a pic of my current situation. You can see that the current price is about 200 pips away from the average price. I may be able to close out soon. Hope this helps. Glen

--- 帖子 #233 ---
gnlir, Thanks for the recap... I've been doing it wrong. I can't believe it! I thought we were supposed to place a ladder of orders with TPs each time we averaged down. Wow... I guess I'd have a couple less open positions if I had done it that way. Oh well. ... ... thanks. Made some nice extra pips doing it wrong yesterday though. I just want to say, I see continuing concern about having danglers. This is a mindset thing. There may be ways to limit dangalers some, but you will always have at least one, and it will always be right near the extreme top of the market. That/those positions will be making you money. We watch this pair unwind and we start fretting about how many open positions we have. But the more open positions you have the more you are paid. The key is, can you get them to close. With this pair, anytime your average position gets to within 200 pips you could be closed out for a net profit any day. And remember, get that close out and you are possibly going to be making less money unless the market starts really rising. So, those dangalers are your friends to a certain degree. That is your "loan to the world". You are the banker. The key is to not overextend yourself by making loans that are too big. Some will fail, but if the risk is averaged properly, then on average you will make money. There are two winning recipes for this system. One is for the market to just go up and up. The other is for the market to fall as far and as fast as we can stand it, and then just sit there, paying us, day after day. I WANT to see my money tied up in this system with the market not going anywhere. The market has been cooperating so far this week. Maybe this weekend I'll have a chance to throw out what we would look for to improve this system. I think Hayseed is working out all kinds of things to improve this system... like nailing down the risk factor so we know how much money we can really afford to put at risk in each position. The 1/2 percent we are working with right now is pretty concervative, but that is probably a good thing at this point. Having a system that is smart enough to judge the market some and figure out appropriate averaging intervals would make for a superpowered system, for example. Anyway... I don't want to get ahead of myself... It would be interesting to hear more about what you are working on, Hayseed.... I for one, would not be scared off by the drops shown on the equity curve you posted.... hint, hint; wink, wink; say no more, say no more...

--- 帖子 #234 ---
thanks gnllr....... well, straight from the true confessions column it appears i've had the rules slightly incorrect also.... not sure if my 'incorrectness' is a positive or negative, will look at it deeper..... hey qman..... i second your concern on the danglers..... on a grid 10 by 10, it is quite possible, even likely, to have 2 trades left at the very top..... the spread is the culprit there..... the second buystop is filled before the first is closed..... if the market starts dancin and the spread widens excessively, many buystops might be filled before any are closed..... about the only way to miss that is to not to be at the party in the first place..... being long only when the macd is below the signal, rsi is below 50 , stoch is below the signal , price is below the 20 and psar is above the 20 , is a very tough row to hoe..... during those times if we use the aphids rules the blisters might be less..... and of course once those above mention indicators move to our favor, using the buystops with avengance would be an absolute positive..... i'm with ibfx also and the spread there on the gbpjpy (9) makes a 10 by 10 grid work hard for her money....h

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I had it all wrong and happy to see that Qman and Hayseed interpreted the rules a little different too (I thought I was going nuts). My basetrade term is same as your 1st trade and Averaging Down Trades . I did TP on average down trades as well! .... no wonder this thing never became positive! Thanks for clarifying. Now I also understand your remark that a TP doesn't make much of a difference in the 1st trade. Man am I relieved.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I think the system does require 10 pip increment limit orders with TP after the average down trade. You did it right, no?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
No, that is exactly what I thought, and what I was doing. I was salivating at the thought of tearing in and explaining how wrong somebody else had it... ... I know so much.... Well, I also know myself well enough to know I needed to re-read the rules.... Shoot.... I was wrong all along.... And the rule is pretty explicit too. I can't blame how it was presented, or anything. I just flubbed it. Oh well.... NEEEXXXXTTTT!!!!!

After year of struggling with small account [and some profit, to pay my spreads ] hours, and days with excel and historical data, I found what I've looking for, and this method was what inspired me thanx a lot!

--- 帖子 #239 ---
A friend of mine suggested a modification that would enhance the return on equity. He stated that it may be worthwhile scaling-in on the short side as well as the long side. In other words, just as you would enter and tp at each 10 pip increment upward, you can do the same for downward trends. Therefore, as the currency pair is trending downward and you're losing on the long dangler, you can simultaneously make money by shorting &amp; tp on each 10 pip downward movement. Consider how profitable one would have been with the gbpjpy since last August if you were playing both sides, especially since the prevailing trend was downward. Any thoughts... Walt

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Of course the major drawback would probably be with the swap rate that you'd have to pay on the short positions. However, since most of the shorts will have closed out with a tp, only the short dangler will have a swap interest payment. That's not a problem because it'll offset the swap interest receipt from the long position dangler. Walt

--- 帖子 #241 ---
While your point is well made, and is/will be interesting to study, you are describing a system that would be a clear departure from the original intent here. The basis for making money in this system is NOT the 10 pip TPs. That is the gravey. In the bigger scheme, the whole purpose is to make money on the swap. As I said last week, we tend to want to curse those danglers, but we need to understand that is where the money for this system is supposed to come from. You MUST have danglers in this system. The more you have, the merrier, as far as the rules go. So our objective is to wisely manage those based upon our account size and the market conditions. TP on a short will eventually lead to having short danglers, and they will guarantee you a loss over time, as opposed to the original plan, which guarantees you MAKE money over time. It is simple, but it isn't easy. But the money is free and certain if you can tolerate the risk. That said, your proposal will be of interest to many people at FF if you can show that it actually makes money. If you start a thread and prove it, you will become famous... at least here. I don't want to discourage you from investigating, or from trying to get somebody to help you investigate. But I'm afraid this thread is probably not the place to do it because your are sort of flying against the original intent. Good luck. I hope to read more about your ideas.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I'm assuming you would close out the short dangler(s) when all the trades are above average price? The disadvantage I see is that the short dangler(s) work against lowering the average price on a big price drop. The flip side is, we're taking profit on the downside. It just would take longer to close the trades and start over. This is like a grid system. Qman, I agree about the interest. This is the jewel of this system.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I have just completed the thread and have a question to work through. How to average down the cost of the danglers? As I understand it - these are the money makers and the underlying goal of this system is to have as many danglers as possible and use the 10 pip profits to offset the downside risk of the danglers. As I see it in my mind at the moment - if I entered new trades every day for a year I could possibly have over 200 danglers - I get here by setting my trades up at the open of the market every day, which would give me a new dangler everyday. granted market action would keep this number less but I am thinking worst case to see if I can live with the risk. So in a year I sit with 200 danglers (which is really good because they are generating cash) but the market is less than my danglers - Ouch. So the question about lowering the cost of the danglers so that I can sit on them becomes very important. This can only be done through money management because the market is not taking out the danglers with price action. What would work - my mind isn't seeing an answer yet and I wonder if there is one. With this answer this system would effectively become relatively risk free - hopefully a better mind than mine can come up with the answer.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I hope I didn't overstate my point about "wanting as many danglers as possible". They are called danglers because they are above the current market price, and represent an unrealized loss. The ultimate would be to have as much of your money in winning positions, and still earning swap. But you have to be able to see the future to be right all the time. None of us will be right ALL the time. The system you seek, is really already before you. I think somewhere it was said that in the depth of the unwinding this past August there was something like 24% drawdown by strict rules. That is easily survivable for me, and not for others. Past 50% I would be getting worried. And there are diminishing returns too, because the more money you have sunk into the averaging, the more you lose as the market tanks. So, believe me, I don't think you can play with the rules and positioning and get much better than this. The improvement, in my mind, comes from pacing the market. So you average down less often as price accelerates down. If it goes down at a slower rate, you average down more often. That kind of flexibility might pay off, in my mind.... .... But I admit, I am sometimes so easily persuaded by foolishly by the randomness of the market.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
hey walt.... next time you talk with your friend, ask him this...... if the goal is to subsidize trades for sake of interest, would it not be better to subsidize our loosing long gbpjpy trades with trades of some other pair also paying positive interest..... the same ea could trade many different pairs while being attached to only one chart..... so it would be in effect watching multiple pairs..... if the gbpjpy trades were going against the trend the ea could add trades on other positive interest pairs with favorable trend to subsidize those gbpjpy long trades........h

Dreamliner, Do you close all orders one by one? Or is there a shortcut to close all order at once? Thanks!

Hayseed, Actually, we've been testing the eurusd in conjunction with the usdchf, as they are about 98% anti-correlated. You would not want another currency pair that was correlated because if one goes down, then the likelihood of the other going down is great. When they are anti-correlated, as with the eurusd and the usdchf, then one will go up as the other goes down. Both pay swap interest for long positions. The fundamental problem with the correlated/anti-correlated strategy is that the amount of pips lost from the losing currency pair FAR OUTWEIGHS the interest earned from swap rates. For example, earning swap on the gbpjpy over the course of a year will incur about 720 pips in swap earnings. However, over the same time period the gbpjpy could have a "net" loss of several thousand pips. Please refer to a thread in the discussion forum by Paogeh call "Carry trade for 3 --5 years". Particularly, on post #23 by byorfx... his ytd results are as follows: unrealized p/l = -3,614389; interest = +330.71

This is the very reason why I favor the countertrend aspect of earning on the downward trend in 10 pip increments in addition to the traditional 10 pip uptrend. I am respectful that this component may be outside the scope of this thread. Therefore, I will not elaborate on some of the specifics that I'm incorporating to still hedge toward the upside trend. However, if Dreamliner wishes to entertain such discussions, then I'd be happy to share. BTW, how come Dreamliner hasn't posted anything in a while? Walt

On OANDA , you can close all the open trades in one click by clicking on the 'Positions' tab, then clicking anywhere on the GBP/JPY row. A popup window will ask you if you want to close out GBP/JPY. Select 'OK' to close all open GBP/JPY trades. Warning: If you have other G/J that are not associated with this system, they will be closed also. Glen

My guess is, he wasn't especially interested in the EA development, and is happy trading his original rules. I don't know if he looks at this thread anymore or not. As you probably read, this system was adapted from one he found on another Forum, and that one has months and months of posts and a very devoted following. He might just be hanging out over there... If you really want to find him. You can also try sending him a PM.

hey walt..... thanks.... just read those posts you mentioned and that supports my reluctance to trade against the trend..... from the fwiw depatment,,,,,, just opened another account for foward testing, might take a day for the account to become active..... i'll place 4 ea's in it ..... timefreedoms, dreamliners version of timefreedoms, along with 2 of mine, spiderman and superman..... will figure out a place to posts the results so as not to clutter this thread..... line'em up and let's play......h

hayseed, What is that last equity curve of? Will you be posting spiderman and superman?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
hey jeta.... that graph is a slight version of the same ea...... i was just trying a new way to keep it under control, hence the name on the graph..... when allowing the ea to have full control over the moneymanagement, if it ever takes off it will ramp up aggressively..... it's a precentage thing..... that precentage controll is all well and good untill the trend turns..... it takes about 30 days for the ea to see that trend change and get out, all the while those last positions can be moving agressively against you..... still undecided about posting anything else, the inability to edit posts, or at least edit attachments, annoys me..... really annoys me..... h

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hayseed.... Come on man! ... If you post an EA here that lets me grow an account from, what.... $3000? to 2.2 million, in -- less than 2 years is it?, I PROMISE I won't curse you when I then see an $800K downturn in my account balance .... As for others whinners, the day my account goes over $1million, I will personally pay for your continuous protection from any deranged person that wants to blame you for a 35% account drawdown. So, whadoyasay, buddy? Deal, or no deal? Hhhhhmmmm? Your stuff looks bloody good my man. Some day you are going to have to start a thread on your Superman/Spiderman thingys.... It keeps coming up, and I'm sooooo curious. In the meantime, I hope you get confident enough with what you are tweaking that you'll let us get our hands on at some point. I mean... I promise to do nano positions to start.... really, I PROMISE.... Oh, by the way. I do believe if you originate a thread, you can continuously edit the original/lead posting.... So, if that is the case, that would be a way to maintain some control. The best way of see to handle this is to just put a link in that first post to skip to the point in the discussion with your latest change and the associated explanation.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
hey qman.... one way to improve almost any equity curve is to observe the weekly and monthly trends..... if a true trend exists, set your profit targets at the average monthly range in pips but also place a trailing stop to start at 1/2 or 1/3 the monthly range... if the average monthly range in pips is 600, we might start the trailing stop at 200..... check the average monthly range of the gbpjpy...... for the averaged down orders, using something like psar to set the " AddLotsThreashold " can set threashold according to the trend.... so if the weekly or monthly trend is down we would add additional averaged down orders only at levels much lower than the -100, such as dreamliner suggested..... and if the trend was favorable we would add averaged down orders at values accordingly..... similarly, the actual lots value could be adjusted to be heavy when the trend is up and light when trend is down or unknown..... the bottom line tends to improve when we backoff and look at the big picture, which should reflect the thoughts of those with a true grasp of economics..... ain't no hayseeds moving that monthly chart up and down..... the metastock fourm has kinda spoiled me..... over there i have almost unlimited abilities..... it helps...... i'll look into your suggestion about starting a thread..... it will be in the beginner section......h

Very good reasoning. I like the cut of your jib, man. Do you use the same handle over at Metatrader? Is that the MT4 dot com place, or someplace else? Would you mind if I quoted your post here in another thread? I think you know the one. We're just getting started conversing on optimization. I think this would give some folks good perspective over there. Thanks for sharing. I presume this is the basic thinking behind Superman and Spiderman... or whatever you are calling them (no disrespect).

Dreamliner, It would be good to hear from you. How's your original system working for you? What have your profits and drawdown been on this G/J drop? I'm up 1.9% since 2/26, but currently with 20 open trades and DD of -8.24%. Current price is about 300 pips from average price. I've started adding a spread of 6.5 to all the limit orders to limit danglers. Glen

--- 帖子 #262 ---
hey glen..... if ya don't mind, what are you refering to when adding a spread of 6.5...... are you increasing the grid spacing by 6.5 ..... or are you refering to the actual bid/ask spread....h

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi everyone, I've finished reading this thread, and I've started setting up some orders. I have a few questions. 1) When we place a new Average In order, we also add 10 pip orders above it as far up as we need to fill in the gap, right? This seems like what dreamliner said in his first post: "4.If market drops (carry trade unwinds) by 200 pips enter a market order once per day, with no take profit, in an attempt to lower the average price of all orders to within 100-200 of current market. Each additional market order lowers the “average” of your orders. 5.Enter limit orders (long) at 10 pips above this market order, up to the orders already entered." But I saw a couple of pages back Qman say that that was not in fact the case. Maybe I misread something somewhere, but I'm a bit confused. 2) How does the spread factor into it? Should we add the spread to the buy price on our buystop orders? This is especially tough because Oanda doesn't have fixed spreads , GJ spreads range from 4-9 pips or so depending on the time of day. Up to now, I haven't been adding in the spread. What I notice happening is that my TP orders get tripped when the price moves up, and some of them hit their target 10 pips, but that because of the spread, I always wind up adding danglers, because the price that goes up 25 pips will take profit on two danglers, but will trip three in total. So each time this happens you add another. I can see it getting out of hand. I'd appreciate some guidance. Thanks rr

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hey Hayseed, Bhale mentioned a few posts back that he sets his pending orders at 10 pip TP plus spread. So I've been doing this too on OANDA. Their spreads on G/J are from 4.5 (during UK and US trading) to 8.0 (higher on the weekends). So I was just adding 6.5 spread to each of the pending orders. A little less profit when the price climbs but also less danglers when falling. Glen

Welcome to the party...

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Love your work. Just wondering when you think you're going to post the Spiderman/Superman. I'm incredibly curious and would love to look at it and see the inner workings of your masterpiece. Are you planning on posting it at all? If so, will it be here or at the metastock forum? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
hehe.... Well, now I read your post, and I'm not so sure anymore... Originally I thought it should be done as you describe. Then I went back and re-read the rules ... but I guess I stopped reading after I saw, "... with no Take Profit...". If you read it like I just wrote it, you are going to decide to only add averaging positions, and not set up a ladder. I further interpreted the rest of it to mean set up your ladder from the Averaged price... ... Sometimes I'm reading this stuff really early in the AM, or very late at night. And then it looks different the next time I see it. So, I'm sorry everybody, for the confusion... but I'm now thinking you are right, the intent is to put a ladder on with the new averaged price -- BUT for that new average down order I think he clearly wants you to not put a 10 pip TP on that. So, as I'm reading it now, I think you put your average down order on, with no TP, and 10 pips above that you build your ladder, all the way up to your average price. So, on a day with a partial retracement in your favor, and then a further dive, you will probably end up with 3 new positions in your average -- 2 New danglers, and the new averaged position. Had I been doing this "correctly" since I entered, I'm guessing I'd now have about 27 open positions... God only knows what my average would be. That would be pretty precarious. By adding in spread I think that would cut the number of open positions to about 15 or 17, which is considerably easier to handle. Again, sorry for the confusion I helped introduce.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi guys, Sorry in advance for the massive post. Qman I actually have to disagree. I think we do put a TP on all those extra limit orders. Going back to dreamliner's first post 2.Place limit orders (long) at 10 pips above initial entry 3.Place 10 pip profit targets on all limit orders, up to 200-400 pips above current market 5.Enter limit orders (long) at 10 pips above this market order, up to the orders already entered. I mean, I'm kind of reading this in, but I think every "limit order" has a TP of 10 pips. Damn! Dreamliner has gone away and left us trying to interpret what he "really meant" hehe... it's like we're trying to read some ancient book in sanskrit. Anyway, I'm sure he'll check back in at some point and can answer questions. On the subject of the spread, I went back (manually -- gahh!) and adjusted all my pending TP orders to take the spread into account. But I also spaced them out more so they don't overlap. So now for G/J I have an order every 20 pips, each with a 13 pip TP. This way no two limit orders will ever be active at the same time, before one gets hit, the one below it will hit its TP. This means that added to the Average-In trades I've made (to bring the price down), I'll have fewer extra danglers. I'm doing that on purpose to limit the number of trades that will be automatically opened. This might not be that smart, because it might limit the rollover interest I get in the long term. But it's designed to protect me in case of a massive down-move. I'll have to see how it works out. Glen, do you still space out your trades by 10 pips, and set the TP higher to include the spread, or do you do what I described above and add the spread to the space in between them? I have another variation I'm considering: I fill in the limit orders as the price goes down, even if I'm not placing an average-in order. I stop at 30 pips away from the current price, for a bit of breathing room. That way if the price goes down to -199, then back up, I can profit from that rebound move. All other things aside, I like this system. I'm trading G/J and A/J with 0.5% NAV, and I've made 1% on my account in two days. I love watching the price move up! My negative P/L is going down, and my profits are going up at the same time as those TP are being hit. Such a good feeling

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Look, I don't know why, but you left out point #4, which is the exact one that "seemingly" directs not putting on a TP on the once a day average down position. It says: "4.If market drops (carry trade unwinds) by 200 pips enter a market order once per day, with no take profit , in an attempt to lower the average price of all orders to within 100-200 of current market. Each additional market order lowers the “average” of your orders." I have no idea if that is the best thing to do or not. But this is the line that got me confused when I looked the second time. As I said, if you stop right there, you would end up running it just the way I have been... which I now believe is incorrect, because, he clearly says later on to build an order ladder. The only way to keep an order ladder relevant is to have it working from the lower averaged level. So I am sure that is what we are supposed to do. BUTTTTTT, you don't get the full lowering average benefit unless you do not put on a take profit on that initial new position. So, let's get to brass tacks here. Let's say you decide a 20 pip spacing on your orders makes sense for you (original rules stated 10 pips for this). Your first average down order goes in at ... 204.00, with no TP. Next order is at 204.20 with a 10 pip TP at 204.40. Your, next order is at 204.40. At IBFX where my account is, and the spread typically runs 9 pips, your 2nd order, opened at 204.20, when the bid price is showing 204.11, will TP at 204.30 when the ask price is sitting at 204.39. In an odd case, price could drop right from there, and I would have NO dangler. But I'll still have my original new average down position sitting at 204.00. This is a really good scenario. Next best thing is if price breaks 204.40, so my new position is put on -- but if market then retraces... Oh, well, I only have the one dangle position. So, I agree (now) that we build a ladder from this lower level, but I am convinced that you do so without a TP for your original average down position. Obviously, individuals can do this whatever way they want to, but that is how I read it now.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Qman, You nailed it. This too is how I interpret Dreamliner's rules and how I've been trading it. Glen

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I do what you described, add the spread to the space in between them. Quick example, using a spread of 6.5 (For those unfamiliar with OANDA, they use Pipettes or 3 decimal places): Average Down Trade (no TP) open at: 203.970 Pending order 1: Price: 204.035, TP: 204.135 Pending order 2: Price: 204.200, TP: 204.300 Pending order 3: etc... Glen

--- 帖子 #272 ---
right, sorry Qman, I think I misunderstood your initial post, and that we were actually saying the same thing and I didn't realise it. That Average-Building trade has no TP, the other ones do. Ok, well now I think I've got a good handle on this system. I really appreciate you guys maintaining this thread, so thank you for being here. Glen, thanks for your input, I didn't care to set all my TPs and orders at every 16.5 pips which is why I chose 20 with a 13 pip TP. There's technically a 0.5 pips blank spot for me, but I'm ok with that. I'm also trading AUD/JPY, which has a better interest rate, and higher returns per pip. I may move to 1% NAV and drop GBP/JPY altogether if I like how the aussie plays out. Cheers, RR

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi guys, you got it right. Alternatively you can place a take profit on this order after you find out what the average price is. In other words, place the order, check the average, and then set it slightly above. I only do this so that if I am not online and the market goes up it will close everything out.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I thought too about setting a TP above the Average Price when I'm away from the computer but how would you close out the other trades that are not in profit (with OANDA)?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
You can actually set all open take profit orders to just above the average, though it can be quite time-consuming to do.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Just to clarify what I do. I use TP of 10, but My orders aren't sace at 10, but 10 plus spread, so my orders might look like this for usdjpy with spread of 3 Buy stop at 110.00 TP 110.10 Buy stop at 110.13 TP 110.23 Buy stop at 110.26 TP 110.36 Buy stop at 110.39 TP 110.49 .... This way I don't get a situation like price going to 110.11 then turning back down, leaving me with an order at 110.00 and 110.10. Every time a TP is hit another order opens. So there are never more han 1 dangler unless I average mu orders down and get opened again.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Oh okay, I didn't know you could set the TP below the current price. Good to know. Glen

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Perhaps this is getting a bit too picky but does anyone have a feeling about when "once a day" should be? Since forex is 24/6 and worldwide and we are all (or at least most) trading either G/Y or A/Y. When would once a day be? Opening or closing of a session like london or ny? Or just some time picked out because its convenient? I have noted that with OANDA the spreads have a tendency to widen after the London session closes and even more after the NY session closes (so the asian session has the largest spreads.. I think). I am currently using the close of the London session since it is a convenient time for me, but any info on how others pick their OnceADay time would be of interest to me.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I personally like to place my market orders in the morning before the NY open because Oanda's spread in GBP/JPY is lower. I don't worry so much about the AUD/JPY since the spread doesn't change as much during the day. This is just what works for me. I'm do my other trading between 7-8 AM as well, so it's convenient because I'm at the computer anyway. RR

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Looks like you are still at it. I like what I have read about only having 1 open position at any one time. I am still with you and really like what I am seeing so far. Have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thans for a very intersting system and trend. I was a bit confised for a while, but think it is mostly clear at this point. The only thing I am still a bit confused, do you have a 10 point TP on the very first market order? In the original rules it does not say this. Meaning you leave that on until?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Very basic QUestion - How do you what .05% of NAB is? Assuming not using Oanada, with initial $10k in account, what would you buy?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
According to the method, the very first trade you place will be the bottom of your ladder of orders, and it WILL have a TP. When you eventually have to open a position to average down, THAT initial order will be made WITHOUT at TP, but all the orders above it WILL have a TP. Sorry, I don't have the time to focus on the answer for your trade size. I'm sure somebody will assist you though. So stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
scotty, well, use a calculator 0.5% of 10,000 is.... 50, obviously. NAB stands for Net Available Balance. The Oanda platform will actually calculate that based on your available margin, so as you open more positions, the size of new positions will actually drop. But that's not essential to the system. RR

--- 帖子 #285 ---
If you take a profit on the very first entry of your ladder during the day you will end up with a dangler with a take profit trade associated with it - so the next day the market opens lower and you enter another ladder - now the question about how to build this ladder and average down the dangler seems to be confusing - my thought is to enter 2 orders at the lower price and rebuild the ladder taking profit on one position and leaving the other to actually average down your higher dangler. Then the question becomes how high do you build the second ladder - just to the first dangler or higher? if you go just to the first dangler you now have a postion at a lower price -and no danglers - the other side you miss out on a profitable run of price above your first dangler - this then becomes a question of risk tolerence. the other scenario is you end up with a dangler lower than your first dangler and then have to rebuild the ladder again using 2 orders from the lower price. Just a thought to work through. Eventually you will end up with a lot of danglers above your current price unless I am missing something in my thought process.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
If I am seeing it correctly, you would continue placing orders right through the danglers, without placing another order at each dangler for fear of having 2 open positions at one time which seems like not a good idea.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I've been following the original thread at another forum too. This post from tiklado caught my eye: I haven't gone back that far yet in my price history study, but I think it's not likely for G/J to move 35,000 pips (or 15,600 or 9,000 even) without a significant retracement. However, it does raise a few questions. How far, using 0.5% Net Asset Value trade sizes, can the market drop without a retracement and not have a margin call (or other 'uncomfortable' level of drawdown). Fxknighttrader, on the other forum, originally traded 1% NAV, 100 pip drops, on two currency pairs since Dec 2005 and was able to withstand the drops since then (though he did switch to 0.5% NAV, and 200 pip drops like Dreamliner's method here). I like Timefreedom's idea of hedging all the long trades with one big short trade if the DD is at a certain level, but OANDA will not let you do this. So I'm thinking about ways to eliminate more danglers, like using the ladder of pending orders, but when the price drops a certain amount below the topmost dangler, then I'll not use the pending orders. I don't know yet what that level is. At some point the dollar and the pound have to bottom out and then we're in business again for a while. Any thoughts or suggestions?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Am I missing something or wouldnt you be limited to 1, possibly 2 danglers until there is a 200 point drop and you add a new ladder? In which case you could end up with 1-2 more danglers maximum? For Example - Original trade 200.00 (still not clear if this should have a TP or not, if not it makes no real sense to me, unless just want interest on this) - put in buy orders at 200.10, 200.20, 200.30 etc. if each one has a 10 pip tp, eachwill fall off before you buy the next one, meaning only 1 can be open when it starts to drop. Of course there could be 2 open depending on the spread you pay. Nut thats all that can be open, correct? Now if it dropss 200 points and you make an avg trade and start to oadder again, same situation. Am I missing something

--- 帖子 #289 ---
It's only a matter of time before we have an unwind that no matter how much averaging-in we do our accounts will not be funded adequately to wait long enough for a retracement, therefore hedging at a predefined DD level is important. IMO if you miss one average-in opportunity while in an unwind it can be the difference of closing all open buy trades on a small retrace vs. having to continue averaging-in because we missed an opportunity. IMO learning how to sustain an unwind while hedged is the key to making a ton of money with this strategy. Again, what I have realized is that once my account is in 10-15% equity DD I will hedge with one sell trade equivalent to all my open buy trades, and then on a daily basis open sell trades half the size of my original buy trade lot size with 100 pip trailing stop. Once price heads back up past the original hedge open price we can use a 200 pip SL on the sell hedge order, which will get us out of the hedge and hopefully back up to the average open price. Not 100% sure here, but my thoughts is once the sell hedge is stopped out we can begin to average-in again back to the average price. Please feel free to question what I have written because this is how we learn best. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Are you currently using this hedging technique with your Aphid EA? (Or turning off the EA and then hedging?) Those performance numbers from 1997 to the present (using Ryan MM) didn't include the hedge. Do you know what the performance for this combination would be?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I think the short sell hedge after about 200 - 400 drop seems reasonable. I've tried it and receive some success. However, timing becomes a critical issue. Knowing "my luck", sometimes the moment I enter a short sell hedge the market retraces and go long. I suppose a short sell hedge with a 50 pip sl/tp in addition to the new long entry after a 200 drop may be a safe bet. Question... has anyone modifed the lot size of the entry that's opened after a 200 pip drop? For example, if you have 5 danglers (0.1 lot each) and today the gbpjpy drops 200 points, do you enter a long position with 0.5 lots or some other lot size. Although the remaining orders above the new entry would be at 0.5% of NAB or 0.1 lot each. Any thoughts... Walt

From my experience reducing lot size while in an unwind will keep us further away from the average price vs. keeping the lot size the same. TimeFreedom

I currently turn the EA off and hedge manually. Right, the performance numbers from 1997 to present did not include the hedge. No, I do not know the performance for the hedge combination concept since I have not coded it into the EA. Hopefully someone, hayseed , can help us code the concept when time permits. TimeFreedom

hey timefreedom.... we would not be reducing the lot size in the drawdown per se.... in a drawdown period, as defined in the chart, all control is turned back over to your ea's rules .... so all values would revert to your math..... in an uptrend, again as defined by the chart, the extra bit of code would add a pinch more lots to the averaged down orders.... this in effect would lower the average..... for those of you that have not looked at timefreedoms math, it's not really the average but a lotweighted average..... so if our inital lot size is 0.01 and the averaged down order has a lot size of 0.02, the amount of retrace need is smaller.... the obvious downside is that if it does not retrace you will have 0.03 lots hanging over your head.... that's why it must only be used in uptrends.... backtests seem to show it's favorable..... we could add lots to both both the inital order and the averaged down orders in differing amounts in times with high probability of success.... backtests here again seem favorable.... i had also taken out the 'HourGood' out of this line.... there are times when the average lotweighted price is hit but the market falls back before the hour() is true so the group will not close..... can't remember the outcome.....h Inserted Code if(HourGood &amp;&amp; ScanOpenOrders()&gt;0 &amp;&amp; PriceAboveGood &amp;&amp; openday!=DayOfYear()){CloseTrade=true;}//close for swap prof. //

@ Hayseed; Your explanation clears up my misunderstanding of your lot sizing concept. I also think getting rid of the HourGood when price is above average price after unwind/drawdown period a good idea. Please contact me via Skype to discuss a couple of recent ideas, which obviously we will post on the thread. Skype ID: TimeFreedom. TimeFreedom

Hi, I learnt about this strategy from this thread a week ago although I have been a big fan of carry trade for long. I never had the answer for huge drop if it ever happens but liked the average in technique. It would keep me in the trade for longer. I backtested it with 5 year data and results are very promising. I am in.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hayseed, Are you referring to removing it in your EA or TimeFreedoms? You have the trend direction in yours, right, so you would know when to keep the HourGood in an uptrend to give you more profit and just close out all trades at average price (whatever the time of day) in an unwind. TimeFreedom, I'm going to add a condition in your EA, if there are x amount of open trades (user selectable) then just close out all trades when PriceAboveGood. That's an option. Looking forward to what you and Hayseed come up with on Skype. Also, once I familiarize myself more with your EA, I'll take a crack at adding in your hedging method with a user selected amount of DD. Glen

hey glen.... actually i was speakin of takin it out of timefreedom's second ea..... but i can't remember if it helped or not..... yes, i believe the original purpose of the 'hourgood' term was to allow for more profit on the group when closed, cause like you mentioned that is what it does..... however, in downtrends, missing the golden oportunity to close all can result in extending the averaging down period.... removing 'hourgood' will close all orders quicker but at breakeven..... it might be worthwhile to remove it during downtrends but have it in place during uptrends..... my thoughts on it were, after days and days of averaging down, it might be better to fore go any potential profit and get out at the first available oportunity..... i also changed the closeall function so it would close the losing orders first..... that assures the lotweighted price will fall rather than rise while we are closing orders.... here is what we really need..... the risk in having a premade grid of buystops is that if there is ever a huge gapup or excessive spreads we will get whacked....... we really need to open buystop trades in an as needed manner..... maybe just have one buystop open at all times.... when one fills , replace it with another.... or maybe when one closes replace it with another.... of course we could have 2 or 3 instead of 1 to give us some lead time.....h

--- 帖子 #301 ---
TimeFreedom, Hayseed, and others.... I hate to bog the system down with lagging and potentially repainting indicators.... but... One thing I'm looking at are two indicators I'm positng here. MT4-LSAR, and SHI_SilverTrend. I'm thinking of using them something like this. Put these indicators on a Daily chart. At the specified evaluation time you first look at the MT4-LSAR. If it is above the line, then you evaluate for an Average Down interval of 200 pips. If below the line, evaluate for an Average Down of -- say, 400 pips. So, if you are below the line and the current price is 400 below your current average price, then you can add a new Average Down position. If it is less than 400, you wait. But if it is above the line you can add a new Average Down position if it is as little as 200 below your current Average position. You would then use the SHI_SilverTrend to determine if you build the ladder or not. If the last dot was below prices, you can build a ladder; and if the last dot was above prices you do NOT build the ladder. Exception: If you have crossed the MT4-LSAR going up, you can build a ladder anytime you next place a new Average Down position. Putting this together with the smarter ladder spacing should minimize the number of new average in positions opened in a downtrend, but make the ones you do put on bring the average down faster. If you put this together with the other ideas you folks are tossing about, like position weighting, I think the combinations will tend to put less risk on the table, and close all dangling position sooner. It does seem somewhat unwise to me, in review, to be building a ladder in the face of a mamoth south bound trend. It just begs to ultimately increase your exposure for a very small gain. I picked up this general "insight" into the market from another thread run by JR2007, whom Hayseed has done some work with. So, nothing original on my end here other than thinking about how to make it apply on this system. I know SHI_SilverTrend has been posted around a bit. I've seen some brief statements about how it repaints. I have not actually seen it repaint myself (while I was watching) but I suspect it does. Nevertheless, it doesn't paint or repaint everyday, so in a long move, it will eventually have you doing the right thing (I think). MT4-LSAR must be a variation on the PSAR. It certainly acts the same way. In the broader perspective, I think, with the kind of rules I suggested here, it would tend to really lower your exposure during the "obvious" (in hindsight, of course) unwinding trends. Unfortunately, I have not found the code for MT4-LSAR, and I haven't played with it yet to see if it isn't just the PSAR drawn as a line.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Anyone actually trading this? I am assuming its going well even though we had the big drops?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Yep, still being traded.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I take back everything I've ever proposed about SHI SilverTrend indicator. I can't make it work given the way it repaints. Oh, and I'm still experimenting with this method, although I did bail out last Friday. I still feel it can be improved, and continue looking for useful tools.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I wonder if someone is using the "demo only" ea that has been posted, or is there another one?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi Hayseed, Have you decided what you're going to do yet? I know you must be busy, but I'm so anxious to take a look at your latest EA's. :-) Perhaps you could use something like yousendit.com and attach the EA's there. That way, you can go back in the post and edit it out if you want. I'd also be willing to host your attachments for you, if you want. I have a dedicated server that can do the trick. That way, you don't have to worry about FF's editing capabilities.

I have been reading through this thread and find it very similar to what I have been doing for the last 3 months over at Oanda . It is not my intention to hijack this thread, just my two cents and I hope it helps. I know that the whole idea of just being on the long side is to get positive interest on your so called danglers but as someone else mentioned earlier with positions so small you don't really get much out of it IMHO. I have followed a grid system that basically follows Dreamliner's rules, open market position, place orders and TP within a 10 pip distance and so on. The 3 main differences are: I split my account 50-50 into a sub-account, so I do the same on the short side and hedge any dangler while profiting from the short side as well. I do NOT trade GBPJPY, it's too much of a monster for me to control and the spread is IMHO too high for this method. I trade it on the EURUSD which has a .9 spread at Oanda thus reducing the possibility of having two or more danglers. I trade a $.03 per $100 dollars on my account (only trading this system at Oanda). There are many ways in which you can manage this system, I personally use two depending on how much time I want to be in front of the monitor. You can either babysit your positions and replace every position that has been closed by TP on both long and short positions or set your orders around 0:00 GMT every day and forget about them till the following day at the same time. Points you might want to consider before trying it: Open your first positions on a Sunday only if and when the spread is at .9 pips. It only works on Oanda, I have tried it with MT4 and MBT and due to spreads and comissions it gets complicated. Don't try to make an EA out of it, it takes no more than a few minutes per day to set your orders and you always have the peace of mind that you are in control of your trading and not some EA that would possibly (maybe not probably) have a glitch and you can use your criteria when closing positions. You will always have 2 positions in the red a long one and a short one. Close positions before spreads rise on the weekend and assume the loss of these positions. I do not trade this system when there are big news events coming out, such as NFP due to excessive widening of spreads, I would close my orders and take the day off or trade a different system. It is a purely mechanical system. You can trade this system with a small, very small account or a big one. Well, that's basically it. Hope it helps someone. And if you see any point or improvement I might be overseeing DO tell!! We're all in this to make money aren't we? Congrats on the thread!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hey Isydeb, thanks for contributing. Let me ask you how you do the trades at 00 GMT and then just come back and do them again the next day. What exactly are you doing? Placing orders long and short on EUR/USD (on sub accounts) and then what? In other words, it seems to me that you are going to have danglers on both the long and the short this way, right? Maybe you can explain your method a little more thoroughly? Thanks again for posting.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Isydeb, thanks! I guess you place long order only above the current price and short orders below? Otherwise you would end up with more danglers... If you reload the grid it's possible you end up with more than 2 losers... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #310 ---
My thanks to Dreamliner for posting this system, it has inspired more than little thought on my part over the past two weeks. One concern of mine with this system as initially proposed is the widening of spreads during news and weekends. At a 10 pip grid spacing, I could envision a major news event that spikes the spread causing you to open more than one new dangler at the top without tripping any TPs. Similarly, it seems like the widening of the spread on the weekend will tend to cause you to open new danglers just after the Friday close if you are close to the next buy step level. In practice, this may not be a big deal as many of these positions will naturally TP if the market continues up a few more pips. I'm planning to start trading a variation of this method with real money next week, but because of these considerations, I will start off with a much wider grid spacing (25-30 pips) and a smaller base position size.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Exactly Xaron, the idea behind this concept is to always have your dangler hedged, so if the price is at 1.4500 you open your orders on the long side 1.4510 (TP 1.4520), 1.4520 (TP 1.4530) etc. And on your sub-account, 1.4490 (TP 1.4480), 1.4480 (TP 1.4470) etc. You do always have two floating positions in the red but one is hedging the other one. Regarding times Dreamliner, I do not want to stare at the monitor the whole day but it is a lot more profitable if you do, especially when the market is ranging, because, imagine that its on a 100 pip range for 2 days, you can make +-100 pips on the long side and +-100 pips on the short side, you just have to replace the orders that have taken profit, always above price on the long side and below price on the short side. Once a day is good for trending markets and a lot easier, but a good in between technique would be to enter your orders before every market open, Asia, Frankfurt, London and NY. I will start a new thread so as to not hijack this one and explain all the rules.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
If you are always replacing positions, will you not have multiple danglers on one side when the market is trending? If you have multiple dangers do you increase the lots on the non-danger side? Will that work long enough to increase capitol and before margin? In fact at almost every peak or valley you will have a danger (both on the short and on the long side). Holding positions (even when hedged) will slowly drain your account over long enough time. The difference between swap on the long side and on the short side it always against you, they don't cancel.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Thanks Isydeb, please post the link to the new thread here, so we can follow along with you and/or ask questions.

This is a lite version of the system, but it works quite well. Delivering anything from 15 to 30% ROI per month. http://forexfactory.com/showthread.p...28#post1927628

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi Dreamliner Thanks very much for your sharing. Though I got some questions here: Based on your strategy, to have 8% to 10% per month, you need to earn 3200-4000pips accordingly ( 0.5%NAV = 25Yen per pip). Is that realistic? When you put limit orders per 10pips (buy &amp; sell), you dont accumulate orders, I dont think your strategy has any advantages comparing with Fxknightrider's original method. You pocket pips at High(buy order) and Low(sell ordres) but pay back next day. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi Dreamliner &amp; all, first I would thank you for sharing this system. I have one question regarding rule no. 4, about averaging down. I will describe it in an example. Lets say we have: 1. initial order, 1000 units, price 203.00 price drops to 201.00 2. second order, 1000 units we have now 2000 units at average price of 202.00 price drops to 200.00 - do we now: 3. third order 1000 units we have 3000 units at avg. price 201.33 or 4. third order, 2000 units we have 4000 units at avg. price 201 so, the question would be, do we use the same order size all the time when we average down, or do we adjust it to the open position? Regards, A. p.s. sorry for my bad English

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Use the same order size all the time.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I also have a very similar system I guess but mine goes against the trend is draw down is good. I also only do long orders and don't accept losses so I am 100%. Thanks for inviting me here dreamliner!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I used to do this BEFORE I found a real broker who didn't stick me with FIFO who lets me sell any order anywhere anytime, this is TO your benefit NOT thiers, which is why most brokers wont let you do this. I did the averaging down thing on the downside. I guess you do averaging up ? keep buying higher as it goes up? My thread is: GBP/JPY Equity Building Profitable trading strategies And anyone interested is welcome.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I spent the majority of the day reading through this thread and think I understand it mostly but want to make sure. There seem to be differing opinions on the proper way to trade this system. Question 1: Are new buy orders placed at a certain time of the day (give or take) or are they pre-set? For example, if it goes down 200 pips is another buy automatically triggered or do you just wait until the regular time that you check it to place another buy manually (it may have moved another 100 or more pips by then)? Question 2: How exactly is spread calculated with the grid of buy stops, placed every 10 pips PLUS spread (this would be 17 pips on Oanda approximately)? Question 3: Take profits on the grid are set to be filled when price hits a new buy order correct (the same pip)? Question 4: When there are a few danglers, is it best to set TP on all positions at the current breakeven point, or average price? Or is it better to just wait until the days end to see where price is at that point? Setting TP at breakeven seems to make more sense because otherwise you may miss a critical retrace that will save your margin, such as during the Aug 07 unwind. Question 5: Has a workable EA of this system been created with the bugs worked out? Forgive me if my questions were already adressed and I missed them somehow while reading through the thread. I think this system shows a lot of promise but want to make sure I understand it before I start tediously forward testing it.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
If you are using a percentage (0.05) then wouldn't the orders actually get smaller as margin decreases?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Glen

--- 帖子 #323 ---
They do. That's the idea . Glen

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thanks for the response. I guess there is no set in stone tried and true method for this system, everyone has their own slight variation. That is ok as long as the general theory of the system is consistently profitable. In the original thread on Oanda , it was profitable without the grid of buys and take profits, mostly from the swap alone and occasionally positions closed in the positive. As far as the EA's go, I hope there will be one for live trading, that would be great. I have never successfully used and EA before (I know next to nothing about programming) but I will download the EA's here and see if I can figure out how to get them to work. It seemed from the posts that a lot of people were having trouble with them though. That would be the ultimate way to trade wouldn't it? Let the computer do it for you and only monitor it!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I have been using the modified EA on a demo with alpari for the last month. I have modified all the TP's to take into account the spread, so my tp is 13 next trade at 20 pip intervals, using .5% per trade. The EA labeled demo, opens 2 trades each day, instead of 1. Also, due to the movement of trading during the opening the trades are not evenly spaced, so i change them to meet my 13 tp and 20 pip intervals, I also delete all orders from the previous day after 23 hours, so as not to have overlaps when it makes it move north. Also, don't shut the platform and reopen it during the hour you have set for placing orders, or it will place another set of order for that day. I also, change the tp on any danglers, to about 10 pips above the average the EA calculates, then shut the platform until the next day, so if there is a move, it will still close the trades.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Can you give us an update on your results? I'm still trading this way and doing wonderfully, making about 200% per year.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Dreamliner, Are you kidding... 200% per year!!! Considering the drawdown the gbpjpy experienced since December, this would be an absolutely phenomenal result. Would you consider cutting your dangler losses at about 400 pips, then double up on the entry that occurs after a 400 pip drop? Hopefully, this makes sense... Walt

--- 帖子 #328 ---
That's nothing. I've added AUD/USD and NZD/USD, same method, both of which are going to parity with the dollar, and that is adding another 400% per year, plus providing a nice "hedge" for the dropping GBP/JPY (which tends to travel with the DOW). No I don't, but that doesn't mean it isn't good, just that I'm happy trading this way.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hey Dreamliner, Returns like that might make a 737 Capt move to an island somewhere. I damn sure it would make a controller call it quits. If you were trading on a $10000 acct what lot size would you use on all pairs? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #330 ---
lol, agreed! I don't ever mess with lot sizes, I just stick with Oanda's percentage allocation feature. Currently I have set to .05%. That way it automatically compounds as the balance goes up. Makes it real easy and keeps it real simple.

--- 帖子 #331 ---

Adding an additional 400% per year!!!!! Do you have any backtesting results over the course of the last few years? Are you using .05% of NAV for each currency pair traded? Also, I'm assuming that the audusd and the nzdusd are not correlated to the gbpjpy or each other... Is that correct? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that you're trading these pairs manually, correct? Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Why did this thread "die" so abruptly? Aren't others finding success with this system, even remotely similar to the numbers that Dreamliner is reporting? Dreamliner... would you be willing to post your trade results for confirmation of your assertions? Perhaps that would spark more discussion. Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #333 ---
No. I have nothing to prove, and do not have the time nor the inclination to post anything of my trades. All the rules are there, simply demo it for 3 months and see if you aren't up 20% or more. My purpose is not to spark discussion, nor keep the thread going, but rather simply to share with people my system, put the rules clearly out there. That I have done, the rest is up to others.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Mike, I've also had similar returns using your system. Are you trading these additional pairs from the same account or from sub-accounts. The word on the streets is a merger with United, huh? Glen

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hey Glen! Yes, I trade these pairs from the same accounts. They act as wonderful hedges to GBP/JPY. Yes, that's the word on the street for sure, I'm not sure any of us are too excited about getting anchored to a lead rock, though.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Dreamliner, Are you using the same system rules for the other pairs you mentioned? Thanks, Lcfx

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Yes I am, though I am reconsidering the "take profit" engine (10 pips profit), as my sons account has grown at roughly the same rate as mine, but with less drawdown, just using the original rules without the take profits.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
No doubt, and I hear they are talking furloughs at UAL as they are parking more planes...crazy. When will this end?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
It will end the same time that EUR/USD begins to go back down, the same time that GBP/JPY starts to go up, the same time America begins to climb out of the horrible debt-hole it has dug, the same time fuel prices come down, the same time the mortgage crisis is solved, and the same time the war in Iraq, and the upcoming war in Iran is ended. We have serious problems in this country that have been building for decades, and though I am an optimist in life, I believe a serious recession is coming because America has been living WAY above its means for WAY too long.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I second that.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I have been backtesting this method on VHands over and over through the big carry trade unwind from the middle of July to the beginning of Oct and I am getting a huge drawdown. Even spacing buy orders apart by 500 to 1000 pips the drawdown is huge. I am getting 50% drawdowns or worse. This is just the FXKnightrider method without the buy stops btw.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
You're exactly correct. I got a drawdown of 38% a few weeks ago, that was the worst I've had. 38% drawdown for 200% a year may not agree with some people.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Please post specific settings you have been using for your back testing. Did you take swap into account? Please post all and exact criteria for entering and exiting trades.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
See post #1

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Yes, swap was taken into account. As far as the settings go I have been experimenting with different ways. These last tests were without the grid of buy stops, it was strictly the "averaging down" part of the strategy. If the price dropped significantly I would place another buy order. 300+ pip drop. I will run another test placing buys on a daily basis when it is dropping and see what happens (closer to the rules in post 1)

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi Dreamliner, where can I get a copy of the system?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
This part of the rules I am not sure if I understand. Say it drops 200 pips and then it rangebound at -200, do you still place an order once per day even if it does not continue to drop, so you could essentially have several entires around the same price?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I blew up the account doing it that way. Notice towards the end I didn't place orders on a daily basis, I skipped a few days just because I had a huge number of orders already.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I am not trying to be overly critical of this strategy, I am just trying to make sure I understand the concepts behind it thoroughly. If I have done something wrong let me know. As I mentioned earlier, I am not testing the buy stop grid as part of it, I am just trying to wrap my head around the averaging down part of the strategy, as on the Oanda thread.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
In order for a person to reply, I guess you would have to post specifically point by point what you are doing. I don't know if the system blows up or not. I have not done the back test. Just to point out, make sure you are entering with 1% or less per pair of the AVAILABLE BALANCE at time of entry. This means that if your available balance is 10000, 1% of that is, 100, so you would be trading with 1 pip = 0.001 cents.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I thought the pic I posted would be fairly self explanatory, but perhaps it is too hard to read. On the last test (that blew up the account) I chose an area of the market that had a downturn and then a period of ranging. I used daily candles. I would place a buy order, and then proceed to the next candle. If during that candle it turned positive I would close the long and open another one. When it went against me I would place another long position if it was greater than 200 pips against me. With each candle that followed if it continued going against me or was simply in the negative more than an average of 200 pips, I would add another long position. What happened is it ranged up and down for a long period of time, with me adding more long positions on a daily basis. When it broke out of the range and headed further short, there were so many long positions built up that it didn't take much movement to blow up the account. I used 0.5% position size, or in other words, one standard lot with an account balance of 200k. On the other test I didn't add longs on a daily basis, only after significant movement short. I ended up with a 50% or so drawdown but regaining it all back and closing at breakeven on a retracement. If that retracement wasn't as large I would have been screwed.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Perhaps Dreamliner can comment on all this. It seems your backtest is valid and according to the rules. Perhaps he didn't have these problems because he diversified? I am very curious what he did during that big big drop myself. I guess using some prudence when markets unravel can go a long way, but I want to know what Dreamliner's thinking was too.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I have been purposely backtesting the areas of the market that have the biggest carry trade unwinds to see if the system can handle them. Like you said, with a bit of discretion following the news one could perhaps avoid the big unwinds...........or not. It may be that you might have a few danglers already before you realize a large unwind is happening. The thing I have not tested it using 0.5 of the available balance, I was just using 1 lot trades across the board. Over all this system works great, especially in rangy markets, but I think it is wise to test the trouble areas of the market to do a bit of "contingency planning".

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I'm not sure what is meant by "without the take profits". Are you saying that the 10 pip TP aspect is omitted, or is it that the TP is a different amount than each 10 pips (for example, a TP on every 50 pips)? thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #355 ---
It seems that many people on Oanda that had been trading this strategy for an extensive amount of time have blown their accounts due to the recent carry trade unwinding. If Dreamliner has some time to post his trades, I am sure the people that follow this thread are going to be much obliged.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Dreamliner or anyone who can answer the clarifying question On any day the current price is below 200 PIPs of the average price of your orders, the system requires that another position be put on without TP and additionally that staggered buys be entered at 10 PIP intervals with 10 TP. The question is if after falling below 200 pips on any day and assuming the market recovers somewhat the next day and closes say at a current price of only 120 pips below the average, do we add staggered buys with 10 TP for that day or do not enter any orders that day because it was not 200 PIPs below the average. What I am driving at is the rule that on any day if the closing price is less than the average price of your outstanding buys but does not exceed 199 pip loss, we enter no orders for that day. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Dreamliner: I have been using your method with some of my own modifications ( less nav per trade.. .03% on slightly less wild pairs. AUD/JPY). I have averaged about a 5% increase in portfolio size per month for March and April. Two months that were not particularly good. I believe that using just the price action combined with a positive carry will generate at least a 50% return with a very low drawdown. I appreciate your work on this method and wanted to say thanks. DrZ

--- 帖子 #358 ---
What an interesting thread. I have never thought of trading like this. It goes against every trading concept I have been trained to believe. Yet the logic is sound - as long as money management is implemented properly. To Dreamliner and the other contributors to this thread I say "thank you for opening my eyes to a concept way of left field to me". You have me thinking........

--- 帖子 #359 ---
That's my understanding of the rule. However, be alert for big unwinds and then think about buying only on drops of 400-500, as per post #1.

I'm still reading the thread. This is FACINATING! I actually devoted all day yesterday to try to get my arms around this thing. The hell with work! Just wanted to say THANKS for sharing, Dreamliner. Thanks everyone, too, for sharing &amp; contributing. This is really captivating reading....and fortuitous, too. I was thinking that there must be a better way to confront this Forex beast and still remain basically whole. Though, I've never been one to shy from a challenge. And I've been known to pick myself up &amp; dust myself off &amp; jump right back in... perhaps one too many times. Hence the source of my trepedations. One thing I need to get straight before the weekend....... The "danglers" thing has got me spooked. Now, as I understand things, we deal with them as part of our AVERAGED position cost, and just live with them until such time as we have a plus total AVERAGED position, then we dump everything, regardless if it's + 1 pip (averaged) or + 1000 pips (averaged) &amp; then start the clean slate again? Am I getting this correctly? Basic concept, at least? Please help me out here! This thread is a breath of fresh air. All contributors...THANKS. This is intelligent discussion here. Lots of learning &amp; sharing going on, too. And, again, Thank you Dreamliner. I'd like to tag along for the ride &amp; contribute when I can be of benefit. Good weekend to all. Peter O.

You got it and welcome to the thread.

hi all, like many others here i've read everything in this wonderful thread. I started this strategy a few days ago in oanda too and everything goes well so far. It's very easy to maintain and i have to say it's by far the most relaxing strategy i've ever tried especially when all your average positions are down!! You know it will be balanced with next days averaging positions or even better, with next wins on retracement. I have only one question, you said : "at any time if you have more than one average position open and one is positive, close all." . Is it really at any time in the day ? or when you check everyday ? thank you again for sharing this , i guess you help making money for a lot of traders here.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Welcome! Glad you are all here. I think this is one of the best ways to trade forex, for these reasons: 1. You don't have to predict which way the market is going. 2. You don't have to stare at charts all day. 3. You don't use any indicators. 4. You profit in rising and falling markets. This is a bad way to trade forex if you are opposed to drawdown. I got nearly a 40 percent drawdown awhile back. Just trade cautiously. In answer to your question, you want to close your trades any time you check and notice that you are positive, if you have more than one trade on. This is just to reduce used margin. You could leave them open if you like, it is up to you.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Dreamliner, Are you using .5% of the account balance to equal what the $ per pip is or the amount of margin to use to open each position? Do you re-enter with a market order as soon as you close out all your "average positions" when greater than of equal to 1 pip? Thanks, Lcfx

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I select .05% on Oanda's user preferences, it's that simple. Yes, I reenter with a market order as soon as I close out.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
For anyone using MT4, can you please provide an example of the proper lot sizing based on this .05% with a 10K starting balance with 100:1 leverage. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Trading GBP/JPY: Assume GBP/USD's current price is 1.9800. $10,000 * 100 (Leverage) * .005 (NAV Size) = 5000 Units (Pounds) 5000 Units / 1.9800 = 2525 Units (Dollars) 2525 Units / 100,000 (1 Standard Lot) = 0.025 Standard Lots or rounding up 3 Micro lots or $0.30 per pip. And I think you want 0.5% NAV, not 0.05%. That's really, really small. Glen

Hi, Firstly, Dreamliner, thank you for sharing your system and ideas. I've been demoing this system for about 2 weeks now, with pretty good success. I have increased my account by 4.5% in 2 weeks, by using the original rules I would just like to echo everyone else's opinions and reinforce the idea that you need to use small lots, and prepare for a drawdown. If I was optimistic and assumed that the biggest unwind was 3400 pips then can some verify my logic below? Before the unwind would begin, I would not know or be aware of the fact. So I would go long at 200 pips below my original entry (or average), the next day it may go down another 200, so I have entered again, the next day a further 200. At this stage, I may begin to think that the currency pair may be in an unwind. So now I start going down in 400 pip segments. By the time the price stabileses I think I would be down by about -20,800 pips. ie 3400 pips from my first position, then 3200 from the next, then 3000 etc. Let me try to tabulise the results: position 1 3400 position 2 3200 position 3 3000 position 4 2600 position 5 2200 position 6 1800 position 7 1400 position 8 1000 position 9 800 position 10 400 position 11 0 giving a total of -20,800 pips. Ofcourse, this is purely matematical, and not including the fact that I may pick up pips on several retraces. Also I may increase my pip period to 500-800 pips, I may use a hedge, etc But if I prepare for a fairly small unwind, then -20,800 pips seems realistic. I wonder if I've missed anything here, before I calculate my position sizes and go live with this? Once again, thank you to all who are contributors to knowledge and sharing. Regards FaxFxFx

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I think this all looks good. I would say however, that when planning your trading, be pessimistic rather than optimistic, and set your lot sizes accordingly. You're right, 3400 is indeed a "fairly small unwind", as I have seen much larger, which you need to be prepared for. The way I have prepared is to throw AUS/USD and NZD/USD in to the mix. This allows me to use the same lot sizes because there is in essence a "hedge" in this, plus I get more interest every day. I think this is nearly the perfect trading system. Not the "holy grail", as we know that does not exist, but to make 200% or more on our account every year with little drawdown, not much screen time, no fortune telling as to the direction of the market, seems to me to be nearly perfect. Let us know how you do.

Dreamliner, Why Nzd/Usd and Aud/Usd? Strictly for the swap amount? Pete

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Pete, they are both positive swap, plus they work opposite to GBP/GPY so as to somewhat hedge.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Y'all! BE CERTAIN TO CLOSE ALL PENDING TRADES BEFORE CRITICAL NEWS RELEASES! I cannot emphasize this enough! Today's GBP news caused the Oanda spread to widen at 25 pips! Thank goodness only 1 of my pendings was filled @ 25 pips for the spread. ALWAYS BE COGNIZANT OF THE CURRENT OANDA SPREAD! It generally varies from about 4.5 to 8 pips. As we are only taking 10 pip profits per trade, the higher spreads can eat you alive if you are not careful. Having stated this, I am highly supportive of this method of trading, and I very much appreciate Dreamliner's approach to mitigate the drawdown effects.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi Dreamliner, Thank you for sharing. My first experience 400 pips down and up. I just followed your rules and when I checked the chart this morning, the current price was above my average price 100 pips. I closed all trades and collected all the pips from limit orders. Now my next experience is 1000 pips down.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hey Mike, Have you thought any more about ditching the limit orders? Is your son still getting similar results as you without them? Glen

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I actually went back to the limit orders and am using them again. Yes my sons drawdown is less, but so is his profit. It just depends on what you want I guess.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Two options for a great system. Glen

--- 帖子 #377 ---
you don't need to put any stop limit orders. what you do is when you average in, you take each top and each entry and take the average of that, and you will make just as much profit and more, because you wont have the spread. The average of course is your exit, but always leave one position on. ie. enter with one long, wait for the top. there must be at least 200 pips pullback before you know it has reached the top. if the next entry long is at least 200 pips, then take the average of the 2nd entry price and the top of the market, (the second entry is 2 contracts) at the average, sell 2 contracts and leave one on. always have one contract on long. check it out, the numbers work.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Scottie, Sounds interesting, but in my futile efforts, I have not been able to implement your directions with positive results. Would it be possible for you to post a brief example? Thanks in advance, tb

--- 帖子 #379 ---
lets say you went long on feb 20, at 209.8 because the moving averages started to turn up and the price pulled back to them. you then wait for the top of the market. how do you know its the top, it has to pull back far enough for you to reenter which would be greater than 200 pips because your entry must be at least 200 pips from the top. why the top, because in the original system, you bought the top by placing stop orders all the way up. so the top is 213.4 and change. the total pips here is 360. you are going to make 360 on this move period. because you now know how big the move was. your next purchase was 204.7 because the ma's started to turn up, the price crossed it with conviction and pulled back to the moving average. so you buy 2 contracts. that is 870 pips down from the high. the average of the high and the second entry is 435 pips. so you are looking for an exit on 2 positions - because you have 3 and always want to be long - of 209.05. if it gets to 209.05, you will make 360 pips. well it makes a new high of 207.7 and doesn't get to 209.05. so if you were trading the original system, then you would have a buy at 207.7. so now you are looking for an entry at least 200 below this and you will average the price in. on mar 10, the price bottoms and crosses the ma's and you enter at 204.6 - 2 contracts. the high was 207.7 your last entry was 204.7, so you want to make 300 pips on the last up move. so the average of the 4 numbers is 207.6. that will be your new exit numbers for 4 contracts leaving you with 1 contract on because you always want to be long. the next high was 207.9 so you are out of the market with 660 pips. and 1 contract on the table in case it continues up. only paid spreads on 5 contracts and still take the same number of pips. draw downs are less. thanks to dreamliner for spawning this idea. your welcome, Scottie by the way, i just went live with this, and i'm trading it both long and short.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Scottie, Can you demonstrate your strategy on a chart starting @ 08.08.2007, which was the beginning of a substantial unwind, using IBFX chart? I am trying to understand your strategy and I hope a more visual presentation with charts would help. Thanks in advance, TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #381 ---
we'll see if i can put a chart here. buy 1 - 248.3 - 7-17-07 top 251 - 7-20-07 buy 2 - 247.3 - 7-25 top 247.6 - 7-26 buy 2 - 240.2 - 7-30 top 242.3 - 7-31 buy 2 - 240.3 - 8-1 top 243.1 - 8-2 buy 2 - 240.9 - 8-7 top 244.05 sell 8 at 244 if that is not close enough, the next trade will get you out starting from the first top, average all the tops and entries gives 244.09. for a total of 720 + pips

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Why did you buy 2 lots @ 247.30 on 07.25.07? I was under the impression that you buy once price retraces at least 200 pips from the top, 251.00, which should be at least 248.00 (251.00 - 200/2.00 pips = 248.00)? Please bear with me here. I find your strategy interesting and I am trying to get my head around the concept. Thanks for your time, TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Scottie, sorry to back track, but I'm still stuck on the first example. I count 6 contracts at the point when you exit with 4 at 207.6. Buy#1 213.4 (dangler), #2, #3 204.7 (avg down), #4 207.7 (dangler), #5, #6 204.6 (avg down). Am I missing something? Thanks, tb

--- 帖子 #384 ---
So, do you BUY or SELL the AUD/USD and NZD/USD pair ???

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Positive swap is buying for both pairs.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Then how do those 2 pairs become a "hedge" against GBP/JPY? All 3 pairs seem to go in the same direction .....

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I'm trading GBP/JPY and NZD/USD. They appear to be fairly uncorrelated.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Scottie, Thanks for sharing your interesting method. What lot size are you using for the first trade or what % NAV? Glen

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I am using Eur/Aud. According to Mataf.net's calculator these are the most negatively correlated. Pete T

--- 帖子 #390 ---
TimeFreedom, i buy when the the price crosses the moving averages to the up side and the slope of the moving averages is up. not until then. so i don't take an entry every 200 pips arbitrarily. this keeps me from taking too many trades when the market is sliding. in addition, my entry price has to be at least 200 pips from the high. by the way, i trade this both directions at the same time. i'm long and short at the same time. the rules are just reversed for the short side.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
yes, you do have six points, but i don't buy the tops. those are just fictitious purchase areas that i use to average in with the lower entries to give me the profits from each one of those moves. i'm not using buy stops like the original system. i only pretend that i do. it saves the spread and it is about half the draw down. Scottie

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I look at this system whether it is the system as laid out by dreamliner or my rendition of it as really opening a position. as the market moves, i adjust that position whether it be long or short to take advantage of the market movements. when the smoke clears, the position will be profitable, but there will be individual losing trades. in reality, this system only takes half of the move from the entry to the top, because we constantly enter with 2 contracts after our initial entry of 1 contract. nevertheless, not a bad way to do money management. do not trade any of these renditions heavy. there are draw downs. so you cant trade 1 mini on a $1000 account and expect to make money with this system.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
another cool thing. since i didn't actually have a buy stop, the "system" doesn't know whether i entered the trade at the front side of the move or the back side of the move. so i can just enter long. the top price is the last recent market high. use that to average in. if the market makes a new high, use that one.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi all, could u make EA to trade this great system? tks

--- 帖子 #395 ---
What are your moving averages? TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Glen, I'm currently using $0.05 / $1000 of account size. that is 5 cents per pip for each $1000 account size. Scott

--- 帖子 #397 ---
i'm using MT4. my moving averages are averages of the pivot. on mt4 that is moving average of the typical price HLC/3 i'm also using a weighted average. so my short is 11 period ma weighted and using the typical price. my long average is 21 period weighted and using the typical price if you don't have this option, you will notice that my ma's are fairly flat when the price crosses them. so an 8 and 16 EMA even using the close would be close enough. the entry is just not that critical. Scott

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I've attached a spreadsheet with Scott's second example. You can add your account balance, your preferred lot size per a dollar amount, and your entries and tops. It will calculate your exits (average prices) and your profits automatically. Hope you enjoy it. Glen Edit: Also, the profit on this spreadsheet factors in closing of the first trade along with the others, which we don't do with this method. However, I put it on there to see what the profit would be. Spreadsheet good for long trades only. I'll update it for short trades later.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I like the concept of this system. I wonder if you guys would comment on the use of a fifo broker with this system. I use MBT and they average all of your positions. So, for example: after the initial entry the price drops 200 pips, I would place a market order and then set up the buy stop ladder with TP's back up to the initial entry and beyond as per Dreamliner's rules. Ex: Initial entry buy 1 lot @ 100.00 2nd entry buy 1 lot @ 98.00 Buy stop 1 buy 1 lot @ 98.10 At this point the average would be 98.70. 1st TP 1 lot @ 98.20 The first TP would be at a 50 pip loss. Buy stop 2 1 lot @ 98.20 At this point the average would be 98.53. 2nd TP 1 lot @ 98.30 23 pip loss Buy stop 3 1 lot @ 98.30 At this point the average would be 98.45. 3rd TP 1 lot @ 98.40 5 pip loss From here on the Buy stop/TP's would all be profitable from the average, however I would still be down 78 pips. So I would need a &gt; 50% retrace just to breakeven and thats not counting spread. (30 + 78 = 108) Thats about the same as buying 1 @100 and 1 @ 98.00...breakeven would still be 99.00 Or buying 1 @ 100 and 2 @ 98.00 ...breakeven @ 98.66.(Scottie) I am thinking that after all is said and done it would be the same its just that with fifo you realize your loss up front and you would recover the loss later in the cycle. It also seems to bring the average down quicker. Is it all the same and the unrealized P/L is just moved to the realized column? ... albeit temporarily. What am I missing? Would it be better to not use the buy stop/tp's until my average is in profit? Please comment.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Here's the spreadsheet that i'm using to keep track of the trades. this helps me keep track of trades in both directions. Scott

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Rainman, you are going to have to keep track of your trades still because you will always have 1 more position showing up than you are going to sell. so you will need to set up a spreadsheet showing what your entries were. you will have a position with the dreamliner system at each of the tops and one position at each entry starting with the second entry. those bottom positions are critical to averaging in the price and they have no take profit. one nice thing about mbt is the agregate will show you what your overall position value is so when the position starts to become profitable, you will know it without haveing to do any math, but you will still need the math to know what your exit should be.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Everyone, I've read through this a couple of times and I think I'm getting the hang of it. The math aspect is a little difficult for me, figuring the averages and all, so thanks to those who have put together the spreadsheets. I think I understand the differences between Dreamliner's original and Scottie's adaptation, but I do have a question. In Dreamliner's, all of the position sizes were the same, but in Scottie's after the initial entry the position sizes are double the first entry. First of all, do I have that correct, and second, what it is the purpose of doubling? I guess it's to bring the average down quicker but I want to be sure I have this right. Also Scottie, it seems evident that you don't care about the swap/rollover since you are in both long and short. I guess after time the two just cancel each other out? By the way, this is awesome. Thanks to Dreamliner for starting this and to all who have participated. Thanks, Richard

--- 帖子 #403 ---
hi Richard, if i'm not mistaken, in dreamliners system, he would start with a stop entry grid. the second position was initiated at 200 or greater down with one position that had no tp and above that was a grid of stop orders. and this is repeated as necessary to collect the profit. consequently, the first grid will give you a position at the top, the second grid will give you a position at the buy location and at the second top. what i did with it is rather than run the position to the top and collect profit all the way up, i didn't us the grid, but i still have the same number of positions. the positions with no tp subsequent to the initial entry in dreamliners is required in order to average in the price to make a profit when the smoke clears as it is with mine. i just chose not to run a grid up from there and left both positions at the entry. this saves the spread, but doesn't change the system fundamentally at all. when i enter using ibfx on the second position, i place 2 positions of the same size. if that is all i need for the trade, then i kill the initial position and one of the second positions. the other position remaining is to collect any additional profits should the market continue up - in essence starting a whole new round. about swap, yes, i initially thought i would run it as long only, but when i ran some tests, i make just as much profit going short as i do going long. which dwarfs the swap, so i ignore interest. however, during carry unwinds, you will end up net long and gain interest during that whole time till the longs can get averaged in.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
It just dawned on me! This strategy is vritually the same as Dirk Du Toit's strategy from his book Bird Watching in Lion Country. Low leverage (gearing) in one direction is the key to success!! The challenge is that it's very difficult to predict the direction of the currency pair over the next week/month/year. Although the rule of thumb is to trade in the same direction as the fundamental trend, this becomes more subjective when comparing one timeframe to another. Personally, I'm not a fan of the 10 pip incremental TP because it creates more danglers when a reversal occurs. Also, there's a huge opportunity cost due to the spread on each 10 pip trade. Simply letting the trades run 50 - 100 pips before the TP, then afterwards waiting for the pullback before re-entering a new position is the best strategy in my opinion. In actuality, Dirk's method is most similar to Knighttrader's approach, which served as the model for Dreamliner's system. In any event, with proper money management and good discretion, any number of variations to this system can be successful. Walt

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Thanks a lot. I must admit, the light bulb is coming on a bit slow on this one. I'll keep messing with it till I get comfortable. I notice you're using an hourly chart for entries. What do you do if you miss a second entry, like overnight or some other time away from the computer? Just let it go and see if it hits your average, and if not just look for a new entry? Thanks again, Richard

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I learn visually therefore I will start posting my charts with entries based on Scottie's strategy. I will only trade long for now, but once I am comfortable with the strategy then I will multi-task, like Scottie, and place long and short trades. Starting Balance: $10,000.00 Leverage: 200:1 Account Type: Standard Initial Lot Size: 0.05/$0.50 cents per pip Averging-in Lot Size: 0.10/$1.00 dollar per pip First Entry: Long @ 202.93 Recent High: 204.39 Average Price: 203.66 (202.93+204.39)/2 Note: Now we wait for a buy signal.

I don't understand why you show the red section if you haven't had a MA crossover in the up direction yet which is required for your first buy.

hey scottie..... a question on this here if ya have the time...... "system" doesn't know , has me puzzled.... what is the benefit in the "system" not knowing what side of the move the trade was entered.....h //---------------- the dreamliners dangler issue can be largely avoided by placing the trades in a different manner....

--- 帖子 #409 ---
My understanding is that we should always have one open long trade initially. TimeFreedom Edit: I read Scottie's posts again and you are right. We should wait for a buy signal first. Thanks for the heads up. TimeFreedom

Scottie When you close multiple positions like post #383 will it make any difference which position you leave open? Highest or lowest price or pick one closest to average?

Richard, i will set price alerts on the chart, because much of the time, the asian market sets the charts for an entry off the london session. if i miss an ehtry, i don't think it will matter for this system. i kind of wish i missed my last one, but a live trial is whats needed to test my psycological impact to see if it will work for me. not that the system won't work. Scott

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hayseed, that is an interesting question. i realized this when i made an entry long and it was really a mistake. i looked back and low an behold, i could have made that entry long prior to the 209 high. then i though, i don't really sell the top, so why not place 209 as my high. since it is my initial entry, the "system" won't care. so, i intend to make half of that move in profits somewhere else. for those who follow Fibonacci, if you just looked at your second entry and your last top, you could throw a fibb retracement on there and your first target would be the 50% line. Scott

--- 帖子 #414 ---
TimeFreedom, if you were to open a long and a short at the same time, you would be net flat, so does the first entry really matter? i'm playing with synthetic hedging on an aggregate style account. the math works, but to be honest, i don't see it yet. we'll see when the smoke settles. the ibfx account is doing just what i expected during the lovely down move. scott

--- 帖子 #415 ---
it appears to me that this system normalizes down to. waiting for a high. take the first entry long after the high after the ma's point up, and take all profits at the 50% area. wait for the next high and repeat. if it doesn't work, average in until it does.

Scottie, I notice you're a civil engineer. I'm a guitarist, so the extent of my math is six strings, twelve scale notes, and twenty four frets. Beyond those numbers I am in uncharted territory, so it may take a little time for me to reach geek status. Presently I am running a forward test on Dreamliner's original, and am awaiting a long entry a'la Scottie. I'm only trying longs until I get the hang of it, then I'll work on the hedge thing. I am also waiting for one of the usual naysayers to come along and p**s on the campfire, telling us it won't work. As of now, I'm pretty much sold on this and am looking for reasons why it won't work. In the meantime, I'll be backtesting this till I get it, and any further tips or help will be appreciated. Thanks for helping us (me) out Scottie. Cheers, Richard PS--- Remember the movie "Revenge of the Nerds"? Maybe there should be one like "Day of the Geeks" or the like. I dunno. Thank God for geeks.

Abnormalone, i think that it would be best to close the first position. in the end, it really doesn't matter, but the first one could be quite negative against you or quite positive in your favour. it just seems like you would like to clean that up so that your averaging is easier to calculate. if you have an aggregate style broker, it wont matter at all because they average everything.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Richard, math and music go hand in hand. i'm a cellist. You will have no trouble reading charts, the market has rythm and timing. Practice makes perfect and that (practice) and a little help from my friends is the only reason that i've started to become profitable.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
hehe, thats funny. be very careful with capital and draw downs with this system. that is one reason that this won't work. and probably most importantly why it won't work, knowing how you handle draw downs psychologically. some people are wonderful scalpers. I'm not too bad at it and can make a profit with it. I want something that i can put to work for me while i'm still working the day job. this is a real low maintenance system. and when it comes right down to it, we all eventually want a low maintenance system that you don't have to sit in front of the monitors all day. Some people are such good scalpers though, that they can set down for an hour and pull in their daily goal and go on about their life. that is their system and it fits them. the more i try other systems, the more i realize its about how you want to do business. when you find one that fits you, you are there. most likely, you will have taken bits and pieces from all over and create your own. just my 2 cents worth.

I just tried back testing EUR/JPY and saving the lowest cost position did cause a problem with the averaging. Another question on the attached chart. The first arrow was a second buy in point and also the high. Price dropped 200 pips but recovered above that point before the MAs Crossed over. Do you buy at the 2nd arrow or wait for the price to drop again before making another entry?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Abnormalone, let me digress just a bit here. if i'm going to use another pair, and i will when i put this to a much higher account size, then instead of 200 pips, i'm going to use a round number close to the bottom of the average true range of the daily chart using about a years worth of data. so it looks like i would use about 100 pips as the range here. if you weren't comfortable with 100, you could use more, i don't think it matters. the first arrow there, i personally would have bought at 156, because i buy when the price returns to the moving averages after convincingly crosing them. in this case, you could use the high of 156.5 area to use as the high average because it doesn't matter if you are on the front side or the back side just so long as you use the number only once, unless you truely bought at the same level and had a double top. so, the entry at the second arrow is a retouch of the ma's and it is 155.35 area. only about 50 pips below the first arrows entry and barely 100 off the top. i would wait unless the high after the first arrow were at least 100 (ATR) pips above the second entry point. if the high between the two is at least 100 pips (ATR) up, then i don't mind taking the entry even if it is at the same place.

That's interesting about the hedge, but what do you do if the hedge doesn't obey and instead of the price continuing down to and beyond 200p, it reverses and climbs to a minus 300p? I mean how do you manage this two headed beast if it doesn't follow the path you just described above? What is your original stop when you open the hedge? Forgive me if I show a complete lack of hedge strategy.

I don't want to criticize those who want to make an ea. I sure wish I could understand why they think it's necessary in this method. It seems to me this method is flexible and only requires a few minutes of evaluating the price and deciding what to do. What to do is simple, and it can't take more than a few minutes a day. (I have been trading this the past week on NZD/USD and .3% positions) No matter what your work schedule, I think anyone can choose a personally convenient time to do what's required. I'm using OANDA , so maybe that's why it's easy. I can't speak to using another broker with MT4. To me the most important issue may be choosing the right cross where the base currency has higher interest and hawkish central bank and second currency has dovish central bank bias and lower interest rate. So far I really like this method.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Not on OANDA because the spread can vary and it gets pretty wide during news. The normal spread might be 3 pips, but when there is a volatility spike, the spreads go to 10 pips or more depending on the pair. On NFP day I've seen it go to 24 pips on GBP/JPY. Also, on weekends, the spread is 10 pips plus beginning a few hours before close and for a few hours after Sunday night (USA time) open. In these cases, a new trade will open on the ask, but the take profit will not get hit because the bid price is now 10 pips instead of 3 pips lower. What you say is absolutely correct for a broker that has a consistent spread that never fluctuates.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hey man, you do put in the 10 pip increment trades above the "average down" trade. You just don't put a 10 pip TP on THE "average down " trade. Only put TP on the 10 pip increment trade's.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
It didn't die abruptly . I think you just have a unique view of things compared to some others....perhaps.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Create a subaccount and transfer part of your balance to it. Click on account tab at top of oanda platform and one option is open subaccount. you can trade short in subacccount and long in primary at same time. a tiny bit cumbersome , but possible.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
The rule is not to space the buying orders apart, the rule is to buy 1 position every day the price is 200 below the average price of your total position . The idea is NOT to buy every time the price MOVES 200 pips It doesn't work like THIS : price 220 buy, price 218 buy, price 216 buy, (nervous so widen amount to 400) price 212 buy, price 208 buy. This completely defeats the ability to close out the position break even when you have a reaction and price recovers before continuing down. THIS is how it works : price 220 buy, price 218 buy (average price now 219) if price is 217 or less now buy(average price now) 218.33. The idea is to keep the average price within 200p of actual price so when price recovers 200 pips you exit break even and start over. You must keep the average price near the real price to exit on a reaction where price climbs 200 pips before resuming downtrend. Meanwhile you are collecting alot of interest waiting for the price to temporarily recover. The way you describe leaves higher average price that is less likely to give you a chance to get out. The way you describe seems to me you are likely to ride all the way to the bottom before price recovers enough.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Dreamliner, I wonder if you know the ballpark drawdown if you only set the limit buys with 10 pip PTs when you first establish a position. This excludes average down buys. Only initially and after closing out breakeven and starting again. You mentioned 37% drawdown which is a little rich for my tolerance. Also, I can't find the knightrider thread on OANDA. Thanks

--- 帖子 #439 ---
You can find the link here : TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thanks a million. Dreamliner called the guy "knightrider" in the first post of this thread but the real name is "fxnighttrader." I was going page by page through a search of "carry trade" which is considerable on oanda. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I have a question for those who are trading the original Dreamliner rules. Does anybody ever set limit orders for the average in entries, the ones where you place a market order 200 pips below the current average? Yes, I know they are supposed to be market orders, but what's happening to me now is this. I'm in a trade with two danglers, and I'd like to get the average down, but everytime the market drops 200 pips below my current average, I'm not there to enter at the market. When I check the trade, it's back within it's 200 pip range. I do understand that this is part of the system, gaining interest while the trade tries to get a direction, so I'm probably just being impatient. I'm just curious to see how others deal with this, or if you deal with it at all. Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Limit orders are best, otherwise you'll likely miss the opportune time/price. One other thing... I believe it's best to avoid the 10 pip incremental action, as the cost of the transactions due to the spread is enormous. Instead, simply open &amp; close every 50 - 100 pips after the currency has a material dip. For example, if you open &amp; close every 10 pips, after a 100 pip movement, you'll only earn about 50 pips (due to the slippage and spread) on 10 transactions; however, you'll earn about 91 pips on 1 transaction or about 80 pips on 2 transactions. Of course, the drawback is the exposure while awaiting a 50 - 100 pip move (i.e. the market could move against you and erase the incremental profit). Nonetheless, I think what I'm suggesting is a more cost effective approach that will yield less danglers. Hopefully this makes sense... Walt

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Thanks Walt, Yes, it does make sense. Earlier in the thread Scottie proposed a similar action, but uses a more hands on approach. Some one else (it might have been you) mentioned it was similar to Dirk DuToit's Bird Watching. I like this approach because it's such an easy to manage method, and as such dropping the limit ladder of orders makes a lot of sense. Even Dreamliner looked into dropping the limit orders. So Walt, I guess you are actively trading this. How many and what pairs are your trading? I noticed some discussion earlier about diversifying but I don't know that anything was settled. All I know is, I like this and I want to implement it live ASAP. Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I'm using a combination of Dirk's Bird Watching system and Dreamliner's system, with unique modifications to make it my own. Currently, I apply it on 3 - 4 currency pairs simultaneously. Ultimatley, it's all about developing your own style/system that's based upon trading fundamentals. These fundamentals include proper money/risk mgmt and following the trend. The big diffuculty is following the trend! However, with good MM one could offset going against the trend for an extended period of time. In my opinion, price action and market fundamentals (economic metrics and news) are the best determining factors for trend. Then again, timing is everything... fooled by randomness... Walt

My update on this system, I just closed all my trades since the current price is above my average price. So far I have experienced 400 and 800 pips down two cycles. Still demo using 1 mini lot, spacing 10, take profit 20, seeing more than $3000 draw down one time. Current profit $1300 in 2 weeks. I think the system works as long you can handle the draw down.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
1 minilot= 10,000? and what is your account size?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
correct on the draw down. if you have a t/p of 20 that will give you 2 danglers (probably 3 with spread) on each run up. in order to average this in properly, you probably should have 2-3 entries at each entry location in addition to the stop orders. this would give you 2-3 mini lots to begin the round. i would want 40-60k in the account if running this. Scott

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Ok, just finished the thread. This has some aspects of the carry grid EA. I'm a little confused on why not to start a new ladder every 200 pips down. Is this correct: Establish a long position with no tp. Place buy stops above in 10 pip steps with 10 pip tps. If price drops 200 pips, establish another long with no tp and place buy stops above with the same 10/10 scenario. Close all when price is above the average and re-start. Some have said to only check once a day or so, but what do you do if price had been below the 200 pip threshold and has come back? Why not just place a new long limit in advance of the 200 decline, and then build its ladder when it's hit? Another confusing point is, I read that someone had 20 or 30 danglers. How many danglers do you get per ladder -- 2-3? Does 20-30 danglers mean they had 10-15 ladders established? That's a 2,000 to 3,000 drop with no retracement? Sorry for the long post, but if anyone can clarify it would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Anyone using the advanced buy stop script posted by BigHope? It looks like it works fine except for the lot size. I'm trying to change lot size to .02, but it won't take. It still opens for 2 lots. Any ideas? Yes, I recompile after the change, and yes my broker accepts .02.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi, Is the general consensus to add one position to a negative average position per day in order to reduce the average negative position, until such time as it closes in the plus? Or...is it to add positions enough to keep average position above -2 00, and then sooner or later a plus day will cancel out the deficit...only time is the vairable. I've been playing around with this in a hundred different ways. Always seem to come back to Dreamliner's rules. Am testing both of the above variations. I wrote an Excel spread sheet &amp; tested over 10 years data &amp; both Long as well as Short. This is truly a profit monster. Need to address the Drawdowns somehow. Scary!! This methodology is by far the best I've run across. Hats off to Dreamliner and everyone else who's particitated in this great thread. Peter O

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Peter O, in all your testing, have you determined an optimal lot size per 1k of account value?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I agree with your praise of this method and concern about drawdown. I will not tolerate more than a 25% drawdown PERIOD. If you open a small account that won't wipe you out if it is blown, this can help solve the problem. For example. If you have $100,000 capital, put 25% in a forex account and follow dreamlines rules. If you are wiped out, it's only 25% of your total capital. You would need to get 33% on 75k to go back even at 100k after a wipeout of the forex account. (30% loss requires 43% to get back even. 40% requires 67% to get back even. and so on) I have chosen to currently only trade NZD/USD (less volatile). I don't use 200p below price of buydown. (for me I use 1 atr (10) ) drop. Also, I use a 15 pip PT on ALL POSITIONS I OPEN .... ALL ....so I never have a dangler. I use a 10 pip gap between PT and buy limit orders when I first begin and as long as I only have one position open my position size remains 1% . Even when price drops, I use 15 pip target on new low position and when PT is hit, I open another new position with a 15 pip PT if no lower position is open and the price is more than 1 atr(10) below average price. This position and buy limits are 1/2 the original positions and Buy limit sizes. This method completely eliminates danglers and greatly reduces drawdown. Additionally, I use 20% of capital as initial and buy limits and only 10% on the buy down positions and buy limits above the new low 2nd position.... etc. ( for $10,000 account position is $2000 initial and $1000 on buy downs ... and this roughly means 1% oanda position and .5% as described by dreamliner) Further, when my total exposure equals account balance, I open buy down only when price is 2 x ATR (10) below average price. When total exposure is 2 x my capital, I go to 4 X ATR(10) and I start taking losses from the top positions. This means I open a buy down position and close my very first position only at a loss. (This is greatly reducing my total risk and the loss is small because of previous interest and PT target profits. If my situation of losses taken plus current open position losses exceeds 25% of my total capital, I will close everything and start over. Also, I don't forsee massive unwinds without having some fundamental information that tells us there is a problem. If fundamental situation is changing, I will get out of particular pair. For example...NZ economy starts tanking and NZD interest rate is going to decline, while USD is seen as rising or being stable. I will be out because fundamental is not in line. And because of my conservative buy down strategy and no danglers, I would be out with 10% or so loss at most (wild guess) without considering previous interest and PT gains. Probably go USD/JPY, USD/CHF in this situation. In any event, I am going to trade the pair or pairs which have steady rising rates on base and steady to falling on secondary currency and will stop trade at profit or loss when this fundamental condition changes. If I were trading GBP/JPY I would use 1/2 or less the position size I use on NZD/USD. Here is example scenario 10k account: Open with $2000 position Price: 7700 PT 7715 BUY LIMIT 7725 PT 7740 BUY LIMIT: 7750 and so on. Let's say first position PT hit second not; I now have 1 position at 7725 and current ATR(10) is 100 At 7625 price (1 atr(10) below average) I open $1000 position with PT +15 and buy limit + 25 (7650) etc. If overnight first position at 7625 hits PT and only original 7725 position is open and price is 1 ATR(10) below average price, I open new position with PT 15 and new buy limits ( position sizes 1/2 original. This method should only when hell freezes over have danglers I believe. I hope this is all clear enough.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Very interesting twist, Ftraderx. I'll give it a try. I think I'll have to download Oanda's platform to see the lot sizes you're using. I have never seen lot sizes described that way, other than in reference to Oanda. What would a 20% position size be on a 50k account? Obvioulsy that's 10k, but how do they extrapolate that to a position size? And you mention buy limits for positions executed above the current price. That's a buy stop everywhere else, so Oanda must be a bit unique.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Very Interesting method. It's hard to think about switching right now since my method is soaring through the roof in profits right now. Of course that's because the markets are going up, when they go down the drawdown becomes hard to manage. Can you please explain "ATR" and how to use it? I don't know what that is, is there an indicator or something for this? Thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi Dreamliner, Yes indeed, these 3 days your method has been collecting pips step by step. Play small this can be a passive income for years to come. Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
In this example, isn't your 7725 positon considered a dangler?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Dreamliner, in one of your earlier posts, you mentioned that you were also trading this on 2 other pair. Are you using the same rules for those pairs -- the 200 pip drop, etc?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi Ben, yes same rules. I'm interested in your "no dangler" approach. What is ATR and is there an indicator that you use for it?

--- 帖子 #460 ---
It's not my approach, it's ftraderx's. But it does sound interesting. I have this ATR indicator. Place on a daily chart, and change the setting to 10 is I think what's he's doing. Edit: Oh, and it means average true range.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Thanks Ben, I use Oanda not the MT4 platform, but I just looked and saw there is an ATR indicator at Oanda also.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
That's right, I forgot you were on Oanda. I have to download that to see what kind of position sizing you guys are using.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
BenQ, I downloaded Oanda's platform just to try this method and I like it a lot, so much so I'm probably going to move a small account from MBT over just to trade this exclusively. The unit sizing they have allows for almost any size trade you want, and the option to set a default % of your account is great, saving you the calculation time. I am experiencing good results forward testing right now, like everyone else. I would like to know how any of you are backtesting this? I have tried some variations like dropping the limit orders, etc., but I really want to backtest the original method. Using some variations, I'm having a hard time surviving the GJ unwind that occurred beginning at the end of December last year. I'd like to see how the original method would handle it, but before I go back and test it by hand, I thought I'd ask for suggestions. I guess I could try to create an Excel spreadsheet of some kind that would help, but I'm not too swift at creating one, so if someone has an idea that'd be great. All in all, I'm loving this. Thanks Dreamliner, and also everyone who has put time in and shared ideas here. Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi ftraderx, I'm interested in your method here. While the profits in my system are outstanding, the drawdown can reach 40%, or more, and I'm interested in eliminating some of this drawdown. Please see below for questions to your system here: Yikes, that's a lot to take in! Let me see if I have it clear: When you say you "open all", do you mean that you manually open each position with market orders, or you mean you set limit orders so they open automatically? Also, you use ATR, do you use the ATR indicator on Oanda? If so, how exactly do you use that indicator to tell you when to open more orders? Ok now see, this is where you totally lost me, of course I get lost easily. Why do you use half the original position and buy limit sizes? Do you just adjust your "preferences" in Oanda to .5% (half of your original 1%)? Why do you use 20% initially and then 10% on buydowns? Are you using Oanda? If so, do you simply set your initial position to 20%? And any subsequent positions to 10%? This is confusing, probably not to you but it is to me. How do you know when price is 2 x ATR (10) below average price, and when it is 4 x ATR (10)? Also, I don't forsee massive unwinds without having some fundamental information that tells us there is a problem. If fundamental situation is changing, I will get out of particular pair. For example...NZ economy starts tanking and NZD interest rate is going to decline, while USD is seen as rising or being stable. I will be out because fundamental is not in line. And because of my conservative buy down strategy and no danglers, I would be out with 10% or so loss at most (wild guess) without considering previous interest and PT gains. Probably go USD/JPY, USD/CHF in this situation. In any event, I am going to trade the pair or pairs which have steady rising rates on base and steady to falling on secondary currency and will stop trade at profit or loss when this fundamental condition changes. If I were trading GBP/JPY I would use 1/2 or less the position size I use on NZD/USD. Here is example scenario 10k account: Open with $2000 position [/quote] Do you mean you just put 20% on Oanda's preferences percentage? How far up to you build your limit orders? 100 above current market? 200 above? Let's say first position PT hit second not; I now have 1 position at 7725 and current ATR(10) is 100[/quote] When you say "ATR (10)" do you mean that you change the setting of the ATR indicator to "10" instead of the standard "14"? What does the indicator actually tell you when it is 1 atr below average? Thank you for your answers as able...

--- 帖子 #465 ---
What leverage are you using for your position size calculations, 100:1? Also, ATR (10) of what period--days, right? Upon analyzing this, days would make the most sense. Thanks, Glen

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Thanks for clarification. I suspected as much, but "what if"ed myself into uncertainty. Thanks for your version of the trade method. Looks like it may get a handle on the draw-downs &amp; evil danglers. I'm pretty much on Dreamliner's rules but testing both Long &amp; Short sides. Testing an idea that one side will hedge the other in a spike or an un-wind, until MM to equalize things. The beauty of all of this is we NEVER sell to take a loss (in theory). I'll give it a good look-over on the weekend &amp; hopefully attack on Monday with new vigor!! BenQ..... No I have not tested for optimal position size per $1000. I've just tested with core base of 1 position whit the premise that a pip is a pip is a pip. In fact it converts position, profits, losses etc. into pips &amp; ignores $$ to concentrate on proportional gain/loss relationship. The $$$ is only relevant if you know the equity of an opened position. P&amp;L from there is equal regardless when seen in pips. I want to approach a ramp-up theory for position size somewhere between increase position only 1/2 direct rate of asset value increase....or something along those lines. It dawned on me that fibonacci sequence may be the ticket here. But I haven't tested anything there yet. Everybody.....nice job here. Thanks for sharing. Let's keep at it. We'll tame this monster yet!! Thanks all. Peter O.

This has to be the simplest method I've traded in a long time. Very easy to trade and very easy to monitor. It's very similar to the carry grid EA. I finally downloaded OANDA to see what some of you meant by a lot size of .5% at 50:1. On a 20k account, .5% lot size resulted in a gbpjpy 10 pip win P&amp;L of $2.65. So, on an account other than OANDA that uses regular lot sizes, that's .03 lots on a standard 20k account. A 10 pip win there equals $2.83, so it's very close. As easy and troublefree as it is though, I'm not seeing a lot of profit. Obviously that's due to the small lot size -- which needs to be small to handle the gbpjpy unwinds. I think this would be more profitable using higher lot sizes on a less volatile pair(s), or ignoring the positive swap aspect of hit and going both long and short with bigger size.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Thanks for your thoughts. I'm experimenting with dropping GBP/JPY and sticking with NZD/USD and AUS/USD. That allows more active trading.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Yes, they are quite a bit less volatile -- anything is really. EURJPY has been good too. I've got a demo going with eurusd and usdchf, both long, so both positive swap. And they're negatively correlated, so one hedges the other -- but, just not a lot of movement lately.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hello Dreamliner et al. I found the thread last Thursday, 29th, read through a couple of times and started placing trades on GBP/JPY Friday, following Dreamliner's rules with the exception of adding my 7 pip spread to all buy/stop orders. As the thread developed I altered some PTs so that some were +10 and some +15 pips and some pull-back buy-ins were given a PT as per ftraderx. I also periodically added to the ladder of buy/stop orders even if I did not open a new averaging position. Not exactly a controlled experiment but good enough to give me an initial feel for it. If I closed the three remaining open positions now, aggregate of +62 pips, I would have opened and closed (round turn) 51 positions for a net gain of 612 pips, maximum draw-down on highest dangler of 534 pips, 209.30 - 203.96 with a maximum number of 8 danglers open at one time. Clearly room for improvement in my dangling department but a system worth working on I think, thank you Dreamliner for bringing it to our attention. Did you get any clarification from ftraderx on his modifications to your rules and how to use the ATR by any chance? Thanks to all for the input so far.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
All, I just closed all trades because current price is above my average price. This is my third cycles. so far I have experienced 400 pips, 800 pips, and the present 400 pips down. So far so good, still demo buying 1 mini lot, spacing 10, tp 20. Started May 23, gain $2000. Will see the end of June 23 how much the system produces this month.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Jones, can you outline your twists to this method?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
In a "nutshell", we must realize that randomness plays a huge role in the marketplace... especially forex. Dr. Nassim Taleb gives an excellent analysis of this reality. Unfortuneately, many ignore this fact and assume that they can consistently time and/or predict the market, even in the short term. I was attracted to this system because it's built upon the premise that the market can move against your position, but with MM and patience, one can achieve success with this system. That's a powerful edge. To improve the probability of success with this system, I was suggesting that you eliminate the 10 pip ladder aspect, as that is very costly (especially with the gbpjpy). Instead, allow your position to ride 50 - 100 pips before closing the position. This is the essence of Dirk's 4x1 trading strategy. Also, we must respect the impact of the fundamentals... ForexFactory does an excellent job in reporting the outcome and providing benchmarks on the various economic reports that impact the various currencies. Note how yesterday's interest rate reports affected the direction/trend of the euro, gbp, &amp; usd based currencies. Walt

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I agree with the extended tps, that's what I've been doing. I've picked up several hundred pips on eurjpy over the last few days. Which are the pairs you've settled on?

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Currently, I'm utilizing 5 pairs (eurjpy, eurusd, gbpjpy, gbpusd, &amp; usdjpy). However, I think that's too many. Once I cycle through these pairs, I'll probably start limiting it to only 2 or 3 pairs. I'm considering refraining from the gbp based pairs because I believe the pound is very likely to lose value in the next couple of months. Since the euro may raise it's interest rates, I believe it may continue to trend upwards. Although the euro is getting perilously high. Once the US economy rebounds, I believe the dollar will strengthen. It's all "timing randomness"... one never really knows what tomorrow will bring... Walt

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I think your analysis is spot on. One of the things I'm still working on is trade size. Trading has been very profitable, but I need to develop a good formula for determining my lot size when trading like this on multiple pairs.

Do you mean you just put 20% on Oanda's preferences percentage? No, this advice applies to the person who was asking a question and doesn't have an OANDA account. I put 1% in preferences in OANDA. How far up to you build your limit orders? 100 above current market? 200 above? I build about 2 times ATR(10).... (current atr(10) for NZD/USD is about .0092 x 10,000 = 92 pips) So I would build up to about 2 x 92 = 184 pips above initial position on NZD/USD Let's say first position PT hit second not; I now have 1 position at 7725 and current ATR(10) is 100[/quote] When you say "ATR (10)" do you mean that you change the setting of the ATR indicator to "10" instead of the standard "14"? That's correct. I use 10 because it represents 1/2 month or 2 weeks. What does the indicator actually tell you when it is 1 atr below average? First, you must understand how many pips are represented by the ATR value for each currency pair. Then you can see that this indicator simply gives a variable pip value that can be used instead of just a constant 200 pip value. The indicator doesn't tell me anything except what the value is for the average range of price for the past 10 days. I use that value instead of an arbitrary 200 pips or 100 pips or what ever because it tells me what the daily natural price range is for the past 10 days. If the market is moving alot and is very volatile, the ATR will be a big number that represents how much the price is moving on average. When the current price is 1 ATR (10) below the average price, it tells me the price is below the average price by more than a multiple of one time the average true range for the past ten days. Rather than use an arbitrary fixed number of pips like 200, I use the ATR(10). The more volatile the market, the bigger the ATR (10) figure gets. For GBP/JPY an ATR (10) of 1 = 100 pips . So an ATR(10) of 3.57 is 357 pips. This is true for all JPY pairs. For USD pairs like NZD/USD,.01 = 100 pips so an ATR (10) OF .0094 = 94 pips and .0194 = 194 pips. I hope this clears up the confusion. Thank you for your answers as able...[/quote]

And you're still trading these pairs in only the swap positive direction? I'm still on the hunt for an ideal basket.

Hi Guys, Firstly, thanks to Dreamliner for this excellent thread. My question... Can someone kindly help to confirm whether I have to go long or short on Oanda for USD/JPY to collect the positive swap interest. Thank You. Vincent

--- 帖子 #483 ---
I trade thru IBFX, and I need to go long to get the positive swap interest. Walt

--- 帖子 #484 ---
How's your account performing with this system thus far, especially regarding the drawdown level? Do you or any other member have any ideas on how to minimize the drawdown impact? Thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #485 ---
jones247, Thanks for the reply. I guess it is to go long for the +ve swap interest.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
goldcourse, Just type in some values to the calculator. http://fxtrade.oanda.com/tools/fxcal...lculator.shtml take a look at the interest rates page below, you should be able to work out what pays what... http://fxtrade.oanda.com/tools/stati...st_rates.shtml When it comes to bid -vs- ask the easyest what to guess-timate the interest value is to use the one that is not in your favour i.e the one that makes you less money

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Indeed. You are paid BID interest (lower one) on the currency on which you are LONG (for example, on USD/JPY long, you are being LONG USD - SHORT JPY) and you pay ASK interest (higher one) on the currency you are being SHORT. The difference is the positive or negative swap, so if the interest you're getting on the "long" currency is higher than the "short" one, swap will be positive. As per the table: LONG USDJPY LONG USD BID 1.95 SHORT JPY ASK 0.80 difference: 1.95 - 0.80 = 1.15 positive swap on LONG USDJPY SHORT USDJPY LONG JPY BID 0.25 SHORT USD ASK 2.50 difference: 0.25 - 2.50 = -2.25 NEGATIVE swap on SHORT USDJPY The inverse occurs when the interest of the FIRST currency is lower than the interest of the SECOND currency, as is the case in EURGBP or USDCAD.

BenQ and all, I'm wondering how you're progressing in developing the ideal basket of pairs to trade this? Right now, I'm demoing the GBPJPY and NZDUSD, and just using original rules except for a 100 pip average in for the Kiwi, which of course is in the crapper right now. Any thoughts? Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I'm thinking along the same lines, Richard7 &amp; everyone. I've been investigating swap rates and especially currency correlations relationship. It seems to me that a optimum compromise can be found using: swap rates correlated factor number ATR ATR relationship % daily/week/month - (shows likelyhood of range of retrace or pull-back) Average-in index Position sizing Average-in sizing Average out sizing (for un-winds which are long on time to retrace) Anything else that might pop up from this study. My guess is this needs to be looked at weekly, or maybe ever other. I just thinking about it at this point. Spent past weekend learning &amp; gathering data, etc. Probably won't take a crack at it till this weekend. Be happy to share result (if any) if anyone interested. Good luck &amp; good work everyone here. Peter O

This is one of my favorite threads, I always come back here to read the next piece of forex wisdom, seriously, no irony included. Needless to say that I hate indicators since I haven’t seen the reliable one yet. It seems like one of the latest topic here lately was "to grid or not to grid" because of the spread for each pended trade in the grid, one or more danglers on the top of the ladder, etc, etc. Here is what I'm gonna do. I'll modify the EA created by Hayseed in a way to remove the grid. So, we start as we normally do with market order let's say with TP=100 and Trailing Stop=30 pips, but no grid. These two parameters of course require optimization, but we are not curve-fitters, are we? J All other Averaging-In and Closing logic stay the same, but also no grid of course. After that I will run back testing for both EAs let's say for 3 years and see what happens.

Greetings all, I'm having some poeple PM me asking if I still trade this system, the answer is yes. I have been trading this, modifying it slightly to reduce drawdown, and still very successful at it, averaging about 6% per month, which would be over 100% per year when compounding. So just wanted to check in and say I still love trading this way, it's the most successful I've ever been at trading. Up until this method I was excellent at picking tops and bottoms: I would buy at the very top and sell at the very bottom. Now I average in and don't care which way it goes and know that I'm still profiting. Thanks all. Mike

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Dreamliner, I would be appreciative if you could share with me the enhancements you have made to your great trading strategy...especially with respect to reducing drawdown. Thanks, Bob

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Dreamliner, Good to hear from you, and thanks again for your excellent method. I have been testing the method using the GBPJPY and NZDUSD. My results so far in about two months of testing have been about 6% per month, just as you have experienced. Pretty good in this slow, sideways market. Please do share with us your modifications regarding drawdown. Although drawdown for my demo testing period has been small, in backtesting I found that DD could be quite large. Let us know what you have come up with. Thanks, Richard

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Am working on that now.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Dreamliner, Would you consider capping your drawdown and increasing the amount of entries? For example, if the market moves 500 pips against you, then close all positions and absorb the losses. Further, instead of buying only when the market moves 200 pips down, buy everytime the market moves 30 pips down. your thoughts... Walt

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Walt, in doing this you are increasing your risk, and increasing the chance of getting above the average quicker. One is bad, the other is good. For instance, if you purchase every 30 instead of 200, you are risking more chances of "danglers" and thereby increasing your margin usage and risk of blowing the account if the market does not retrace in time to get above your average. But you are also lowering your average price quicker, thereby making it possible to get out of the trade with a smaller retrace. So it is really what you are most comfortable with. Personally I would not like to cap drawdown and get out at a huge loss. I would rather develop a method of limiting drawdown initially, which is what I am currently working on and have found a good way to do this. I'm putting it together now.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I can hardly wait! Much anticipation! Thanks, Bob

I have been following/trading (with real money) the SuperCarryTrade/Dreamliner strategy since March 08. During that time I have increased my portfolio size by an average of 7% per month. March was my worst month with just 4.8% and May the best so far at 12.5% increase. I have been a full time/professional trader for the past three years. Until I happened upon this strategy I was in the camp of two steps forward, two steps back. I was making money but without any consistency. I have studied trading strategies from Elliot Wave to Gann Theory, Used chart patterns and Fibonacci Retracement, followed moving averages and various oscillators. In my opinion, the SuperCarryTrade/Dreamliner strategy is superior because all of the aforementioned methods rely upon predicting the market. ( I think price will…. Because of the wave count, gann line, trend line break/bounce, Fib level, EMA5x13 cross or MACD move). With SuperCarryTrade/Dreamliner you are not predicting the market move but reacting to it. I have made a slight modification to the strategy because it was initially devised using the GBP/JPY cross which is extremely volatile. I am trading the AUD/JPY which moves much less than the original pair so I have decreased the “drops 200” pips to establish a new position. If you check the average ATR of GBP/JPY you will find that it come out around the 200 pip level, however the AUD/JPY registers only about 125. Therefore, the only modification I have made is to establish a new position and trade ladder when the chosen pair drops below the 125 mark. I have maintained the 10 pip take profit ladder even though I know I am giving back 4 pips for ever ten I take, but it just works out easier for me (less math) to do the 10 pip TP with a 5 pip separator on the ladder. My draw down has never exceeded 20% but I maintain a strict 0.05% NAV position size. Im not sure if SuperCarryTrade/Dreamliner strategy can be considered the holy grail, but it has the great advantage ,as far as I am concerned, of putting a great deal of logic ( collect interest, trade in only the direction of the long term trend ) into the whole trading game. Just me two pips worth. DrZ

Here is example scenario 10k account: Open with $2000 position Price: 7700 PT 7715 BUY LIMIT 7725 PT 7740 BUY LIMIT: 7750 and so on. Let's say first position PT hit second not; I now have 1 position at 7725 and current ATR(10) is 100 At 7625 price (1 atr(10) below average) I open $1000 position with PT +15 and buy limit + 25 (7650) etc. If overnight first position at 7625 hits PT and only original 7725 position is open and price is 1 ATR(10) below average price, I open new position with PT 15 and new buy limits ( position sizes 1/2 original. This method should only when hell freezes over have danglers I believe. I hope this is all clear enough. [/quote] ftraderx, Thanks for sharing Your ideas. Sorry, but I still don't get how You get rid of danglers in the way You described. When the price hits Your BUY LIMIT order and then retraces down without hitting PT, You have a dangler. Thus 7725 is a dangler . Next day at 7625 You open position with PT+15 and limit buy at +25. Let's say, price goes up to 7635 and then goes down again. Now You have another dangler at 7635 . This way You accumulate danglers easily on the carry unwinds. Of course, You can possibly kill them later, when price goes up more than ATR range, but until then You keep danglers. Or am i wrong? please explain. Thank You.

I'll have to admit I scaled back some and am carrying 20 1KLOTS of Nzd/JPY I should have bought that NZD/USD at .75 I told my dad to buy a boat load there he didnt. Ive got less than 10 1K GJ lots spread from 211.75 down to 210.00. I made a killing on todays wild runs scalping. Yeah I have 1000 pips of GJ drawdown and banked 100 pips or more by far a good day. Expect GJ to go soaring back up. You know she will try to look back and she if she ever didnt But where most traders error is by judging the present through the eyes of the past. Analysis doesn't matter to some but it sure tells me where to concentrate my orders.

LTU The original method doesn't have a profit target when you open a position after price falls. It does however have a buy limit grid with profit targets. This means you could have 2 positions opened if the buy limit is hit above position you opened and profit target on buy limit doesn't close trade. This is an extra dangling position. By putting a profit target on position you open on price fall, you insure only one position total will be added because if the price moves up, the PT will close the position before the next buy limit is opened. I don't think you understand how the method is originally explained or you would be able to recognize the difference. Maybe if you read and understand original method again and then apply the idea that all opened positions will have a profit target. Then you may see what danglers are eliminated. The old profit targets are adjusted for TOTAL POSITION breakeven the next day if a new lower buy down position is opened of course. At some point in the future, I'll try to explain the whole concept the way I have been using it successfully since May 15 2008. Hope it is more clear.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
ftraderx, Yes, it is more clear. Thanks for explaining.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
fTraderx, when you first position freezes and the price never come back, you never close this position ? Thanks, (mechanical translation)

Okay. I am going to explain my tweeks on this method by referencing the instructions from the first post on this thread. I will color changed items red in dreamliner and give blue what I use. GPB/JPY ( NZD/USD , USD/JPY and EUR/JPY) ALL THREE) Long trades only (interest positive) Use 0.5% of your Net Available Balance on each trade ( Oanda does this automatically) 1.Enter at any time with a market order I include a 15 pip profit target on this order. 2.Place limit orders (long) at 10 pips above initial entry (10 pips above profit target of initial entry with a 15 pip profit target ) 3.Place 10 pip profit targets on all limit orders , up to 200-400 pips above current market ( 15 pip on ALL orders) 4.If market drops (carry trade unwinds) by 200 pips (I use ATR(10) to calculate how far price drops before I enter a market order once a day. I am not going to explain ATR so don't ask. If you don't know how to use ATR to figure average pip move in a day go study forex books please) enter a market order once per day, with no take profit , in an attempt to lower the average price of all orders to within 100-200 of current market. Each additional market order lowers the “average” of your orders. (I open this order at .25% of net available balance (1/2 size) and I put 15 pip profit target on this position. I'll remove this profit target the next day if it isn't hit. This means I am building my position when price is declining at 1/2 the rate because I am using only 1/2 position size (.25% vice .5%) when price declines. This substantially reduces drawdown.) 5.Enter limit orders (long) at 10 pips above this market order, up to the orders already entered. I use 15 pips and I start 10 pips above the profit target of the market order. Dreamline doesn't put profit target on that first order. Special note : On the next day, I remove the profit targets that haven't been hit on the previous days order and readjust all profit target and buy limits from new order. I remove profit target orders when I open another new down position the next day. Once the profit target is removed, all open positions with no profit target of 15 pips will close when market reaches average price of current total position (ref next paragraph) 6.At any time you have more than 1 order open, and the market is above the average price, close all orders (Oanda makes this easy to do). 7.If market continues to drop, continue to place orders (as in numbers 4-6 above), attempting to keep the “average price” within 100-200 pips of current price. I use atr(10) calculation for daily pip range instead of flat pip rate. It's important to explain that I remove the profit targets on the down price positions after 1 day when new lower positions are open. If you don't do this, you will never see lower average price enable total position to close when price rebounds. If you can understand the basic method, you can see with these modifications no more than 1 new position can be opened each day. Original rules allow 2 new possible positions each .5% every day with original market order (#4.) plus 1 limit order that opens and doesn't hit profit. I have 1 x .25% position open and original method may have 2 x .5% open ... big difference.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
First position 7750 with TP 15 pips. Market drop 7700, if atr10 = 50 pips, buy again. Now 2 positions average 7725 ; if market up to (7725+15) 7740, close all positions if market down below atr value average down, open another position. Ok ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #515 ---
The position closes according to rule number 6 of this method posted in the first page. I follow all the rules of this method only with tweeks in position size , profit targets, and currency pairs.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
with my tweeks the second position would have hit a 15 pip profit and if price is still below atr(10) 50 you open another position. See my new post above.

Thanks.[/quote] Sorry I am not better at clearly explaining things. It's much easier for me to see in my mind and do than to explain. You need to understand original method has potential of opening TWO positions at each new entry...one from initial market order with no profit target and one extra from buy limits that stay open and don't hit profit target. This is true at each new level down when price falls as well as initial first opening. If you clearly understand how original method works you will understand this.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I like Scottie's modifications (posts on page 27, I think) and believe his method reduces drawdown. I've been trading it positive swap on GBP/JPY and EUR/USD (fairly negatively correlated), and not long and short on G/J, like Scottie becuase paying swap is just too depressing for me. Looking forward to your ideas, Mike! Glen

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Ftraderx, I too have been trading a variation of this successfully for several months, albeit with a different mix of pairs and a few tweeks. In your explanation above, Item #4, you re-enter at half size. Do you then remain at half size until you close all orders? It seems the only time you are at full size is on the initial order and the ladder above it, but as soon as it unwinds you're always at half size until the final cash out, correct? In your second to last paragraph, you say that you "... remove the profit targets on the down price positions after 1 day when new lower positions are open. If you don't do this, you will never see lower average price enable total position to close when price rebounds." Are you saying you remove just the tp on the orders, or the orders themselves? Can you expand on that paragraph a bit. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I remove the tp on the old order and enter new order with tp. On next day if I am opening another new order I remove tp on old positions and recalculate the new grid of limits and pts. Sounds like you have a complete grasp of the basic method. I've had maximum open position drawdown only 5% since May 15 and I am getting about 4% per month. I have to say I mirror exactly dreamliners sentiment of past experience with different methods. I really love this method and I have tweeked it to suit my level of risk aversion.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I have been noting your tweaks to dream liners strategy and believe there is a lot of logic behind them. The move from 10 to 15 pips TP will cut down on the cost of doing business/spread and the reduction of NAV percentage after a large fall is also very conservative. I do have a question however. If you open a new market order every day that the average price of the position exceeds the ATR(10), do you build a totally new Limit Ladder also? Hypothetically you could have a position down say 200 pips and enter a market order today with your 15 pip TP and a 100 pip Limit Ladder at 15 pip intervals. The market goes up, take out your original market order for a 15 pip profit and then drops back down to its original position (negative more than ATR). On the next day would you enter a new market order and a new Limit Ladder? Would that not give you two Limit Ladders at the same level so that instead of one position getting hit/opened, you would have two or perhaps even more if the trading pair had been in a tight range (such as the AUD/EUR). I have been using the original strategy since march 08 with real money results of about 7% per month with a maximum drawdown so far of 20%, but of course I am always looking for a better mouse (or in this case PIP) trap. Thanks for your input. DrZ

How often do you close out your dangler positions (i.e. once a week, once a month, etc.)? thanks, Walt

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi all, I've been testing &amp; refining this system since the begining of this thread. I've changed the method here &amp; there to suit my patience threshhold. For last 30 day or so, been using the same rules un altered. I skipped the danglers part for simplicity. Have ignored, for now, the swap rates. Sized positions per ATR relationship. Next step is to re-size according to ATR relationships as well as growth factor. Been doing both long and short sides of same pairs, to get close look at money management aspects and position size factor. Looking at 6 different pairs. On the long side I've got: 30+% net profit 34% Draw down -14% open trade position P/L On the short: 19% net profit 45% DD -36% Open trade P&amp;L It looks like this has potential for 6% (avg) equity growth per week, or 25%+/- per month....on both sides long &amp; short. Account is only 1-3 positions (ATR dependent) per $10,000 acct. balance. 6 pairs. I'm really encouraged by this method. In closing, through all my previous testing &amp; rules changes, I couldn't get it to lose money....provided the rules were followed never fail &amp; pay no attention to the draw-down, becauyse it's only temporary. Great method, Dreamliner. Thanks. Peter O.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi Peter O, Why do you think that the Drawdowns are temporary? For individuals, trading this method since last year, it's very likely that the 251.35 long entry may never recover... Walt

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Ok I am having a hard time figuring out the lot sizes. I know that Dreamliner stated .5% of net available balance and that Oanda does this for you but I'm using mt4 so I am figuring this out manually. So according to my calculator: $1000.00 net * .5% = 5 so (using a 800 pip drawdown for looking at figures) 5 mini lots * 800 pip drawdown = no more account a lot size of .50 * 800 pip drawdown = $400 lot size .05 * 800 pip drawdown = $40 So my question is which one is the correct lot size per the original rules? I'm guessing the second one with the .5 lot size but not sure.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Shootish, If i'm not mistaken, 0.5% of net avail balance means that if you have a $1000 account, use $5 for each trade (i.e. $5 as margin requirements). Assuming 100:1 margin, you can only buy $500 worth of currency, which is only half of a microlot. The other way to mitigate huge drawdowns due to carry trades unwinding, is to add to positions only when a certain criteria is hit, such as minimum 1 or 1.5 ATR down from the current average entry. The beauty of this method is that one need not monitor charts or price movement all day. Have just started trading using this method, the results of others so far are quite encouraging. There is a possibility of using ideas from another carry trade concept. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=67211

In interest payments it wont matter will it? I can easily make 30% interest a month on GJ with my eyes closed. That is 360% per year. And we will see 250 before se see 180. And that is where I am betting my money. 214.50/60 next, then kiss her good bye for another few hundred pips. positive swap Drawdowns are like money in the bank. She is obligated to come back to 251.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi Jones 247, Yes, your point is accurate. But the object in averaging down here is that you buy into a deficit position to minimize the potential loss. Say you get in at 251.35 &amp; then the pair tanks -200 pips to 249.35. Yikes! So, now you buy in a position to average the deficit. Now you stand at: #1: -200 #2: +/- 0 Average position now is only -100 (effectively 250.35), so yo don't need to get back to 251.35 to BEP, but only 250.35 Further, next day, say the position recovers to 250.00 from the last of 249.35. Now you are looking at average position of -35 And, say next day, it gets up to 250.70. You're still 65 short pips from that original 251.35.....BUT Thanks to your averaging, you position is really + 35. And that's X2 for 70 pips profit. So you dump both those &amp; start again. As far as drawdown...maybe better defined as a fluctuating constant. It's always there, but never a factor till you close out everythin, because you never close out a loss, or if you run out of account baqlance. See RRAM2's # 531 post above....said as well as any. I hope this helps you. I see through the thread that you are really trying to get your arms around this thing. Keep at it. There's plenty of friendly helpful folks here to assist. Just ask. Good luck Peter O

Why don't you open FXGAME account with oanda and figure out lot sizes from that. The .5% is .5% of available MARGIN. for oanda this is variable, but I use 50 to 1 margin. Also, it's the us dollar exposure which changes depending on the pair. I don't have any desire to try to explain this. You can get free demo with FX trade and figure it out yourself. I have oanda account. GL

You operate with that kind of leverage and you deserve to have your account wiped out

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Ftraderx, Along with your newest tweaks (3 currency pairs, 0.5% / 0.25% position sizing), are you still planning on using the 2 and 4 x ATR factors, taking losses off the top, and 25% closeout techniques in your method during unwinds? Thanks for sharing, Glen

I did up a simple EA based on what I understand of Dreamliner's rules in his first post. I ran a back test of 2 months and the results were encouragin (approx. 13% per month) but i must say the green equity line is rather scary. I don't think too much of it cos my modelling quality sucks...I can't seem to setup a MT4 client to do proper backtesting. if anyone can help me or point me in the right direction, I'll be eternally grateful. I'm now forward testing the EA to work out any bugs and how it'll perform under IBFX's brokerage. the attachment is what i have so far and the backtest graphical results as stated earlier. here are the inputs explanation extern int EA_MAGIC_NUM = 511112; extern int StartHour = 19; extern int LadderHeight = 400; extern int CarryBuffer = 200; extern double Slippage = 3.0; extern int TakeProfit = 10; extern int StopLoss = 0; extern bool MoneyManagement = true; extern double RiskPercent = 0.5; extern double Lots = 0.1; extern double MaxLots = 15.0; extern double MinLots = 0.01; StartHour is the hour the EA should start the ball rolling and/or check if the current price is above or below the Current Average position. I'm using GMT. you should change to whichever hour you want. but according to Dreamliner's first post, it doesn't matter when you start, as long as you keep to a 24hr cycle. and this hour is the only time the EA will do any work at all. The rest is up to the currently opened orders and price action to do the job. LadderHeight is how high you want the pending orders to go. CarryBuffer is the level at which you'll start a new ladder when the current price falls below the current Average by that amt of pips. TakeProfit only applies to the pending orders as the position at the bottom of any ladder will have no TP and SL at all. MoneyManagement if set to True will use "RiskPercent" of your Account Equity to calculate what position size to open for the orders. if you set it to False, it will use Fixed lots instead as defined in "Lots". Try it on Demo first as I've yet to sort our runtime bugs if any. any suggestions and feedback are welcome. regards, Zen p.s., the drop at the end of the graph is due to the strategy tester closing off all opened positions at the end of the test so they're not to be taken into consideration as far as the system is concerned.

Yes. In fact I did so in June when NZD/USD dropped from above .7900 all the way down below around .7400. I am also evaluating a kind of matrix where I would buy down at increasingly larger gaps down based on price falling by 3 or 4 atr rather than just price being X atr below average price. The matrix kicks in when there is no doubt a serious unwind is occuring and price is not fluctuating in a reasonably predictable range. I have also realized that in the event of big unwind, my currency pairs are all gonna drop even though NZD/USD and USD/JPY should and currently do, move in opposite directions. I am trading now as I first described, but I am working on ways to reduce the risk without completely killing profits.

@ Zen; Here is an article on how to get 90% modelling quality. You can find historical data from this link . TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi Dreamliner Have you corrected the drawdown issue in your system ?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Made some amendments to the ordering logic. ver1 close off primary ladder and opens a new one prematurely. rectified in version 2. version 2 also contains one more input. "CustomSpread". This is actually the additional spacing between the buy stop orders. so the space between each order is TakeProfit + Spread. It does cut down on danglers but you'll get less trades as well. if you don't need this additional spacing, just set it to 0.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hey Zen, great work on the EA! The ver 1 has made over 10 percent on my demo, how ever it is refusing to work on IBFX mini accounts, i see no messages such as "Ea is working/Ea is sleeping" Also the the experts tab says "2008.07.23 19:27:03 Super_Carry_Trade_ver1 GBPJPYm,H1: zero divide" Is this something to do with ibfx having a 'm' after the trade symbol? Such as GBPJPYm?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Every system has drawdowns, but yes I am indeed lessening it.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Sorry but I'm not very confortable with english, what does "when the market is above average price" mean ? How do you get the average price ?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi again Dreamliner, First of all thanks for Sharing with us the nice system.I have started to forward test it on live micro account.I am ok with drawdown ,but wanted to know how i can reduce the drawdown ?You mentioned earlier that you were working on something to reduce the drawdown.Could you please share with us ? Thankyou again for giving us a wonderful system Bhupinder

--- 帖子 #543 ---
The EA refused to work further because it encountered a divide by zero when calculating the average price. Zen/ some buy orders has no TP as well, u need to check the LowestPrice against the current price as well to see if the lowest price is higher or lower than the current price

--- 帖子 #544 ---
The problem of zero divide was solved thus - The idea was given by a friend on yahoo group -MetaTrader_Experts_and_Indicators Change this code in the function: AveragePrice = AveragePrice / PositionSizeTotal; NormalizeDouble( AveragePrice, Digits); CurrentAveragePrice = AveragePrice; with an if filter: if (PositionSizeTotal&gt;0) { AveragePrice = AveragePrice / PositionSizeTotal; NormalizeDouble( AveragePrice, Digits); CurrentAveragePrice = AveragePrice; } ALSO, another solution was suggested to use AveragePrice = NormalizeDouble( AveragePrice, Digits);

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hello, I have been reading and following this thread, also been trying to test this EA except with FXDD I am getting invalid trade volume. Would soemeone please correct the code and repost the EA. Thanks

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hello, I am running EA on FXDD demo. When it opens trades it puts take profit on first order. My understanding was that first order stayed open with no TP. Did I miss something or set up EA wrong?? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #547 ---
The first order does indeed take profit; there is no reason for it to stay open. As long as the market is moving up we take profit, increase our balance, and compound. It is only when the market sinks that we put an order in with no take profit, which has the benefit of lowering the "average price" (blue line in Oanda ) so that when the retracement comes we can exit lower, at a profit. This is all real easy to see on Oanda.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
So that is where the new ladder would begin after what ever drawdown we choose?? By the way how's life at COA? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I don't trade the EA, so I can't answer at what point it begins a new ladder. But manually, you can do it either via a certain number of pips, or by time. I am testing both systems right now. The time system is better for those who are unable to check the market but once a day. COA is fine, we're furloughing about 300-500 pilots initially, possibly more to come.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
hi dreamliner what s your lastest version is it v1.01 b ? when i test it i just leave it to default ? regards

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I don't use the EA and don't have any idea about version numbers. Possibly others on here would know.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
dreamliner i just want to see if i understood well your system : 1- i place a market order 0.5 % of my balance . with 10 pip profit and i place pending buy orders 10 pip away from the entry price with 10 pip profit until 400 pip . if the market reverse and go the other way i wait until i m 200 pip dd and i start placing one buy order everyday without TP . i hope i understood well if no please correct me . and by the way what you mean if we have more than 1 order open and its positive and above average we close all a ? how long you have been trading this and how much was the worst dd you have seen ? thanks

--- 帖子 #553 ---
OK, so.......I have to admit that all this time I have had this wrong. I was initially entering my market order with no take profit and putting TP's on all my stop orders in the ladder. I assumed the benefit was that when in an uptrend, you would collect the interest by holding your initial position, then when a top was achieved you averaged the price down between the top and the initial position. So it's TP's on all initial orders, and no TP's on the buy downs, just the new ladder built from the buy down. I think I have it right now? Richard

--- 帖子 #554 ---
I realised the EA opened too many pending orders on the secondary ladder, when it should really stop when it reaches the first ladder. I'll have to look through my codes again. the zero divide problem was due to my careless programming. thanks shiva for pointing out my mistake. ronaldosim, in version 2, all orders placed should have TP, except for the starting order of the second ladder onwards, this is so that it will help bring down the average. we shouldn't just look at the lowest price. we should look at the average of all the currently running positions. It will close out all opened trade and pending orders when the current bid is higher than the average price during the predefined hour stated in the "Input" tab. I can provide a true/false option for the EA to close out all trades as soon as this condition is met regardless of the current time. that'll be in version 3 and note that this means moving away from dreamliner's orginal strategy and I wanna keep this kinda changes to a minimum. I'm sorry for those using mini accounts as I've not catered for symbols ending with 'm'. for the time being, please use the "Lots" value for fixed lots and set "MoneyManagement" to false. will post version 3 when its ready. currently having quite a few projects on hand so it might take a while. please be patient.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
All of your questions have been covered in the thread. When more than one trade is opened and the current price is above the average price of all trades (in other words, overall profitable), then close all trades and begin again.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
You got it. You may have been combining two different variations into one method -- Dreamliner's original method and Scottie's version with the tops. I've gathered three good methods from this thread: 1. Dreamliner's original (Post 1) 2. Scottie's (top averaging, saving spread costs and lowering DD) 3. Ftraderx (conservative method which lowers DD) Dreamliner will be sharing his modifications soon as well. Glen Let's vote this thread up...It's had my 5 stars.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Glen, Thanks. You are absolutely right, I had gotten Scottie's mixed in there. I like Scottie's method; it's just a little too 'hands on' for my time constraints. Anyway, five stars from me too. Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Really interesting system. Started testing on 7/21/08 and .68% up so far on my DEMO. I use ladder 10TP with 16 pip length from each other, in order to get rid of danglers or hitting TP while getting new position. Average spread on Oanda is 6.25 = (4.5 + 8) / 2 I use 1% on each position. Enter new position between NY and Tokyo time. New position entry only if market price -150 or less from the average. Will post new results next week.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Any news on EA?? On draw down ti opened new position but did not start new ladder. Did I mess something up?? Thanks Mombone

Zen's EA has a divide by zero error that stops the EA from working. he is working on it.

Hi, Hayseed I found this thread one hour ago, just finished readind it, I use carry/hedge trading for almost a year now, and I have a ideea: how about making a reverse EA (to act completely reverse) to attach it on a CHFJPY or USDJPY chart.As GBPJPY and any of this pairs are strongly correlated, we suppose to have a minimal drawdown everytime (sure, a reduced swap earning). Could you try to reverse everything, I ave tried, but I have not the necessary skills to do it.... so, it didn't work. Please help me as I want to run a forward test in this formula.....

--- 帖子 #567 ---
hey dragosd1...... got your pm.... will see if it can be done..... this was from a good while back.... several here really weren't interested in ea's , some were quite colorful with there opinions..... so i moved on..... you asked about threshold..... there was some discusion about when to add orders in the average down theme..... the 'threshold' option allows you to set the point where those orders start...... all we did was add a version of dreamliners rules to timefreedoms ea.....h

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi, thank's for your reply. Yes, I know, I have studied the strategy, but I don't think it's ok to make 10 average sets (main order + buy orders) in a 150 pips range....that is killing the account. A logical approach is avg1 = main - treshold, avg 2= avg1- treshold, and so on. I believe this EA will have a great future for carry trade, but please consider making even a "reverse" Ea, as I was explain it to you.... Btw, what settings are you used for this backtest? Mind to post hem?

--- 帖子 #569 ---
hi hayseed yr EA is good; have been forward testing it and so far hv got good results; are u using it live yrself? attached is results fr 16 Jun 2008

--- 帖子 #570 ---
hey dragosd1 ..... basically that is how it is working..... we can change the code to have the user define how many orders are sent in each set..... i don't follow your thinking about killing the account..... the orders are buystops, so until filled they should not have any effect on the account..... can't remember what settings were before.... my default settings are tradehour '18', averagevalueincrease '30' , delay '144', lot size '0.06'..... below is the backtest for 2 years....h //------------------ hey ron..... i used a very different version of the same theme for awhile.... it used all 6 types orders at the same time..... and worked well when used with trend type filters..... the difficulty is in controlling our enthusiasm...... kinda easy to go over board with orders.......h

Regarding the "killing the account" issue, you hae to admit, at every avg position, we have at least 1 buy order dangling, so in the case that I was presented, they we're 32 open positions of 0.10 lot, the DD was huge....Maximum orders what does it affects? Buy stop orders or global positions or maximum avg positions?

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Demo_only, you will find it in attachments

--- 帖子 #574 ---
I have been working on a reverse version of this ea, I got a nice part ready, but there is a error in it, that gives "invalid stop" print. So, anyone interested on taking a look at it?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
hey dragosd1 ...... thanks for the reply....... ok, now i clearly see your concern about the drawdowns and fully agree with those concerns..... 'demo only' was an attempt to merge dreamliners rules with timefreedoms ea...... just a cut and dry merger...... timefreedoms ea works almost perfectly..... but still, there will be drawdown periods some of which will be extreme...... he makes it thru those hard times by methodically placing 1 new order and 1 new order only at a time..... and at a price lower than the last...... if we try to place more than 1 and in a grid fashion, the enevitable danglers will add fuel to the drawdown fire......h

--- 帖子 #576 ---
The thing we have to change is to place a new avg position at "threshold" distance from the PREVIOUS one or from the INITIAL position (main).After that, everything will be ok.....

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Ok, a preliminary test....

--- 帖子 #578 ---
hi william bring it in; we are interested in all contributions by ppl willing to share....

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Ok, guys, here's my observations.... Any other pair tested wth the same settings as for EURUSD leads to account dissapeareance.... (even with the basic settings that hayseed has tested eurusd). As explanation, in my testes I have used a 50,000 USD account which is similar with a 5,000 USD micro/nano acc at IBFX. The max profitability obtained during the specified period was around 10,000% (5,000,000 usd profit vs 50,000 usd deposit), but as you will see, the relative DD was huge even the absolute DD was just around 8,000 usd.So, it's very risky! This is due the fact that the EA places every day averaged positions even at the same relative price. Imagine market is in consolidation, but we are still at AVG Price-Threshold, so conditions are met to open new average positions, so if we are in consolidation/ranging for 10 days, we will have 10 sets of average positions opened.After that, if we have a drop of 200 pips, we are DEAD! Imagine what if after this drop we enter another cons/ranging period for another 10 days - another 10 averaging positions, and after that period we have another drop...It's a fact that from all this positions we have the huge profit factor, but it's too risky! That's why none of the other tested pairs didn't survive.... So, for everyone willing to help, we need to make some adjustments to the logic of the EA, if you want a stable and profitable one... Ok, if someone knows about PipMaker EA, it's something we need, it's logic is to place countertrend trades at a specified distance/spacing from the initial position. Spacing can be a fixed value or determined by STDDEV/ATR. It can place both direction orders buy &amp; sell, but we are interested in buys only. So, if one of you guys (since I have not the skills) might have a look at the code of this EA to "collect" the neccesary sequence and to implement it in Demo_only EA, of course, with the author's OK, I think we can start backtesting a more stable &amp; promising modified EA. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
ok, here's the backtest I was taling about, detailed statement in zip file

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Nice EA, Zen , but mine opens correctly the first 3 ladders, then the price falls under the average and it opens only buy position, without buy stop orders , then price goes up, closes all the buy stop orders in profit, but never close the buy orders, so I hang with 6 open positions at +300 pips each..... do we need to close them manually?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
ZEN LEOW, 1st of all, congratulations for the EA! I'm really impressed with the method. I have a dought. You EA follow the rule #6? "At any time you have more than 1 order open, and the market is above the average price, close all orders"

--- 帖子 #583 ---
hi dragosd1 thks for pointing out Pipmaker - very interesting concept; i had a look and it is quite hard to grasp what Pipmaker is trying to do; wld u be able to explain the whole concept or point us to a specific source/page/doc

--- 帖子 #584 ---
The thread is located on ForexTSD forums.... Pipmaker opens countertrend positions at a fixed/dinamically calculated spacing, then it close them in some average price + profit. It can work in martingale mode or liniar mode....

--- 帖子 #585 ---
here are my initial findings on Pipmakerv15.1 for eurusd 2jan08 - 5aug08 a) default settings crashed b) set ReverseDirection =false (to compare like for like with SuperCarryTrade) crashed c) only good results when TradeShort=false; which means that the countertrend shorts are not working well i will set the parameters for pipmaker and supercarry to be as similar as possible and see what kind of results both give

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Arough comparison For pipmaker (not using countertrend cos results crashed) Autiospacing=false Trendspacing =10 Spacing =100 TradeShort=false ReverseDirection=false Lot=0.01, no increment For Supercarry GridTotal=10 GridStep=10 Lot=0.01 Threshold=-100

Hey, how's everybody doing during this unwind? Just trading the GJ, I'm in a 30% DD right now. I'm starting to spread my average in entries to 400 pips or so to limit the damage. The Pound is in bad shape and could drop a lot more. How about you all? BTW, I'm not using an EA. Cheers, Richard

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hey Richard, I've had a max 15% combined DD using Scottie's method, most of it on the E/U (closed my G/J trades before the drop). I'm trading both the G/J and E/U. We're seeing the largest monthly drop on the Euro since early 2007. I've got a 200 Month MA sitting around 190.25 and a monthly trendline in the 176.00 area for the pound before it could bounce up...so, I agree, it could fall hard. Hopefully not though ;-)

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I am keen to start trading this system on a demo account. Like to know how this system has performed during the pounds largest drop vs USD in 34 years. Should look into ways of limiting DD.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I'm in about 6% drawdown on the EUR/JPY NZD/USD combined, but I deveated from what I've posted here by shorting both along with long as a hedge. When the hedged positions had enough profit to offset the loss of the top position long , I closed it out and reopened smaller hedge position matching long total. This reduced size of my positions and lowered price at same time. I am trying to reduce and get out of NZD/USD and EUR/JPY and trade only USD/JPY which has continued up. I never traded gbp/jpy and don't forsee doing so in the future. I don't like GBP pairs. My results since May 15 to date is about 35% up and max 10% open draw down.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi ftraderx, Correct me if I'm wrong, but are you stating that you go long and short on the same currency pair simultaneaously? Or, do you go short against the long position when a huge drop (downward retracement) occurs? The problem with going short to offset the danglers is that the market may turn and start back in the upward direction. When this happens, the short positions will prevent you from profiting on the upward movements. Walt

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I went short when the fundamental situation changed on the NZD and EUR. And maintained my long positions. Instead of buying when the price drops, I close short position and remove top long. This reduces my position size and lowers average price of long position. Each time I do this my overall risk drops. Yes, a rise offsets profit, but as the price continues down, my long average gets lower and overall short and long positions get smaller. I have locked in a guaranteed loss of 3% at this point if I close all positions. I expect to get out of this with no losses, but worst case I get out with maybe 2-3% loss on position which will be no loss if you count my profit on USD/JPY. Both eur and nzd will be going down for a while. I am not worried about it at all. This is not part of system, but I am precisely controlling my risk and know exactly what I stand to lose in worst case. RBNZ is going to lower rates over next months and ECB will lower rates as soon as it gets the slightest easing in inflation concern. If I'm wrong, I lose 2-3% which I can make back in 2-3 weeks. If I'm correct, I will continue making 35 - 50% with maximum maybe 10% open drawdown. I believe I stated in earlier posts that a change in fundamental situation means all bets are off. My goal is to get out of these NZD/USD EUR/JPY positions. I see USD/JPY now and USD/CHF later when US rates rise above CHF rates as pairs I will use over next 12-18 months probably.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Greetings, I too have deviated from the original concept and slightly modified the original "demo only" to be slightly more protected against downtrend spikes. My ea: open buy position -&gt; open set of buystops as the buy is open, check if there are any sellstop, if there are, delete them then open a set of sellstop under the buy position. no stoploss no takeprofit, these sellstops are trailstopped (10 pips) one more sellstop is opened at buy position - 110 pips, this sellstop has orderlots equal to total buy orderlots (sum of every buy order still in the market) (even this is trailstopped) in the case a spike drop down, the last sellstop should save yr account... ps equity is still a problem, as in heavy downtrend, we still have lots of positions opened. i'll try to test the system with 50k and orderlots scaled down to pretend we have 5k or less. this morning test with 50k and 3k sized lots showed capabilities of whithstanding a spike &gt; than 5-6k pips --------------------------------------------------------- ps, i'm very interested in what ftraderx is saying, as he closes positions so he is in fact with less positions in the market, resulting in a bigger equity throught time.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
did another tuning to my strategy. as the last buystop put in serious danger my equity as it can occour a s/l sometimes, and because it just occourred as i was holding something like 105 buy positions, i lost 4.20 lots (because is 0.04*120) * 20pips, so i decided to edit orderentrysize of stoploss orders, and equally divide the total number of lots entered in buy positions between them, now i have 10 sellstop orders with lotsize changing depending on how many buy positions i have in the market. of course if lotsize is less than market minimum, default 0.01 microlots are ordered.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
i see the logic on your system. I have thought a way to do it without constantly hedging positions thus jeopardizing profits if market trends up. I am constantly trying out to modify demo_trade EA as it gets profits in almost all conditions other than huge spikes and fast market. Your idea (as i get it) is to go long and short at the same time (correct if i'm wrong) or (not sure between the two, clarification needed) to put a sellstop order matching (what do you mean by matching? i can guess but detailing that part should help finetune yr system) long positions. Leaving the idea of going directly with market orders, the case of putting a sellstop sized as the total has proven to me unprofitable, i would instead first calculate pips lost for first opened buy positions (as they could vary between situations, eg. constant loss or market ranging), then put 10 sellstop orders (like previously explained on my posts, with trailingstops) and divide that pips between them, leaving a margin to whithstand occourring losses of some sellstops, and some margin to guarantee a profit. i would then calculate the sum of their profit. (minus the possible stoploss damage) if that profit is &gt; than first buy losses, calculate if it's so big that it can close more than 1 buy position, then close the appropriate number of buy positions, store the difference of profits - buypositionlosses in a variable (could be of help in closing the next buy position), then repeat the iteration doing the same with the next topmost buy position. if the profit is &lt;, store in a variable that loss and retry next time with another set of sellstops, until is &gt; than the fist position now i will implement this on buystop ea, let me know if you liked. ps. just one problem... when buy orders are small, eg. 1, or 2 or 3 positions i think it's not worth it, because demo_trade and Dreamliner's System overall takes profit from averaging price and having huge lots taking a "small" pip gain (average position-bid price), i realize the risk in having that amount of lots in the market, but i can't realize the "right amount" of orders to be kept in market.... Pheraps we should regulate that basing on the account size... what's your point on that one? just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
what happens to the system in cases of rapid interest rates changes, as it happened in us last year??

--- 帖子 #599 ---
if you talk about backtesting ea, no interest is considered so if it's profitable you can trade on a swap free broker. if you consider though that interest gain is positive for a period, you could be in danger if you don't exit with the positions for a longer period of negative interest.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I have an idea: Once we start with a market order with a TP of 10 pips we will only have one dangler when the market goes up 10 pips and then retratces. This is due to the limit orders at 10 pips interval with 10 pips TP placed above each market order. If this is done with each average down order too ( a TP of 10 pips) than we also have here a maximum of one dangler a day in case the market goes up 10 or more pips. What this will do though is it might take a bit longer to reach average to sell out. But in severe unwind it will leave you less draw down.

The limit ladder is there to lock in profits on the way up. Until we have hit the top and the market goes down and we have to average down. The limit ladder use 4-5 pips spread on each 10 pips profit (or 15 pips profit if you use FTRADERX method). 40-50% of your profit is lost in spreads . Why not keep the order open and have no profit target. Use the highest position when the market retracts for your to calculate your average. Example you buy at 204.20 market goes up till 206.20 and retracts. The 206.20 is now the starting point for averaging in. So the market retracts 200 pips as per original strategy and you buy in. Also here forget the limit ladder and use the highest range in the day for use to calculate your average. The limit ladders would have exactly done the same but with trading cost of 4-5 pips for every trade. Your profit will come in at the time you sell out all your trades when you have hit the average (based upon intra day highs when you placed the order). Only problem is you have to calculate the average yourself. The Oanda average will only show the average of your market orders not of the intraday highs you would have captured with limit ladders. I believe this will save you money by doing fewer trades. The spread pips saved from the limit ladder can be used to bank as additional profit or to lower your sell target when you have a lot of open trades thereby reducing drawdown. You get out of all trades earlier. Can anyone follow my logic and can anyone see negative side effects? Maybe I am completely of the mark here.

@ FTraderX; How many short positions did you open and when did you open the short positions, e.g. every 100 pips? Did you stop opening longs once you started opening shorts? What was the trigger to start opening shorts? Thanks in advance, TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #603 ---
It works. This has already been proposed by Scottie. Just look up his posts on this thread and you'll find the discussion. Glen

I have a question on Scotty's interpretation... I am trying to put all into an EA, and have quite an idea to do so, i just miss the case of a big uptrend just after the first buy... AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND THE METHOD I'LL USE IN MY EA: if the price goes up, let's say 500 pips (slowly so ATR is still low), then price retraces, the EA would then consider that top market as the position to consider as top dangler when averaging. as said market falls down the ATR level of the currency, and EA triggers 2 buy orders, of the same amount lotsize. As the first set of 2 orders are set, the EA calculates it's profits doing: AveragePrice-marketprice, if positive, close positions leaving just one of the two last opened orders. In our condition, even if we are in profit of 500-200 pips as the 2 positions are opened, the system as is thinks to be in loss, waiting to close the positions. the price needs to go up a bit more to trick the system into thinking that we are in profit, then all positions are closed. Do you confirm this procedure? i think that in the long run this could still be profitable, but the very start of it it's a bit flawed... The top gain against the other method are spreads and here comes if the market goes up just a little after the first buy, then the retracement forces you to put next buys below the first market order. i eager to discuss with you directly, i've seen you've done it in the past.

I am demoing this strategy whilst experiencing a huge cary trade unwind. * 100K - 50:1 leverage * Started of with 0.5% initial trade at 206.265 at 17 August 2008 * Averaging in with 2 trades of 0.5% every day once average has shown a 200 pip drop. * Only long trades. * Aim to sell at average position plus 100 pips. * Today bought at 194.406 1 september. * Drawdown today 10.33% * Average position is 201.168 - so a good 650 pips to go before hitting average. I want to show other traders how this strategy performs in a huge unwind.

Update 2 september. * 16 positions open at $25K * Average 200.294 * Bought today at 193.745 (approx 650 pips from breakeven) * $510.55 interest payments * Drawdown 12.33%

Hi, I am a newbie in Forex, and decided to start demo trade with Dreamliner's strategy a few weeks ago. Here are the screenshots of my 3 demo accounts (all 3 started with $5000): AUD/USD http://img373.imageshack.us/img373/6...dusdsc5.th.jpg GBP/JPY http://img54.imageshack.us/img54/1189/gbpjpyrc5.th.jpg NZD/USD http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/1...dusdek6.th.jpg This is my first try in Forex. I hope it will eventually turn into positive, because watching my equity dropping every day is a bit disappointing By the way, as a beginner, I am not exactly sure that I trade it correctly... If you see something incorrect or strange on the screenshots, please tell me.

3 September * 18 positions open * Average 199.494 * Bought today at 192.579 (600 pips from average) * $553.87 Interest from swap * Drawdown 14.69%

SoldinTime: Interesting exercise. does your report contain "danglers" or just new average positions? When you established the new average position did you include the takeprofit ladder? DrZ

--- 帖子 #610 ---
4 September * 20 positions open * Average 198.906 * Bought today at 193.303 (560 pips from average) * $601.46 Interest from swap * Drawdown 13.59% I aim to sell at average plus 100 pips as I have not setup any take profit limit order ladders. I feel these ladders waist a lot of pips in spread. It is better to take profit when you come to sell. Lowest price of the whole testing period was 191.50. Top price for initial position was 206.265. That is 1476 pip drop in about 3 weeks.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
soldintime: So, let me recap for clairty. You take one position per day if the average of the position is less than +100 pips. The position has no take profit or stop loss. The position size is 0.5% of portfolio at 50:1 leverage You do not establish a limit ladder when you establish your new position. A couple of questions regarding your positions. How do you determine at what level to take a position? Time of day? Even number? etc etc??? You only take one new position per day? or one position per day per pair? (I ask because your post of sept 3 indicates that you have 18 positions open and one day later on sept 4 you now have 20 positions open. ) By way of background, I am trading a live account with a modification of the original DreamLiner system. Since march 08 my return has averaged about 5% per month interest and realized profits while enduring a maximum of 20% drawdown. I look forward to your continued testing. DrZ

--- 帖子 #612 ---
When todays position (around 11GMT i normally look )is 100 pips below average of all positions I will buy 2 market orders of 0.5% of NAV. Once the difference is less than 100 pips below average, I will do nothing. I only trade the GBP/JPY pair. Too many pairs in the account and you will get a margin call. I have noticed too many blown up accounts on the Oanda forum of people trying to trade 4-5 pairs this way. Take profit for all positions if price hit average + 100 pips. This is because I have removed the limit order ladders Limmit order ladders push the price of the average up but you loose a lot of money in spreads. In the thread scottie has mentioned the benefit of removing the limit order ladder and instead sell at higher price than the average position.

5 September * 22 positions open * Average 198.066 * Bought today at 187.640 (1040 pips from average) * $653.58 Interest from swap * Drawdown 27.26% Now we clearly see the dangers of this unhedged strategy. I have had an almost 2000 pip drop. I will continue with this strategy and see what will happen.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
After a 40% DD on my account, I have come to the painful conclusion that these methods are not for me. I cannot be a no S/L person anymore. The psychology just doesn't fit me. I can't stomach a large drop just to make a few percent at a time. I know that I pushed for a 5-star rating on this thread, and it still may be. There have to be new ways to limit DD, which I haven't learned yet. I'm taking my loss, learning more about myself and my trading style, and moving on. Good luck to Dreamliner and everyone else here. Glen

--- 帖子 #615 ---
before trading it live i tried at least to develop an ea to suit my needs of hedging. i've come to conclusion that you should play this system just in uptrend, after drawing your trendlines. And it's better to have a system with SL, or at least perfectly hedged. Otherwise you will be always in danger by the market sudden moves. try another way, learn another time.

The unwind started 7/29 when price was 214.78, and if you started at that price account blown, using any method you choose. My alpari demo on this using the EA posted about 4 months ago, that says demo only, was blown last week, September 2nd, down to 0 (alpari doesn't protect your margin), when price reach 192.xx.

Hi all, I read this thread with great interest and had applied it to my LIVE account for 4 days , seems the result doesn;t looked good , too many danglers trade , I haven't finish reading the whole thread yet, I;'m still at page 12. from this 4 days observations, this strategic only work in UPTREND or RANGING market. In downtrend market , example massive drop of 1000---5000pips, this strategy would kill most of accounts. If that's the case, might as well as use 100% GRID trading , earning both ways of the market, well, need to forfeit the swap ..... any thoughs on that ? Thanks, paogeh

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I have been following this thread from the beginning and have the following observations. Original method of having no TP on the average down order will help keep the average price near the current price. But the limit order grid with TP's can cause multiple danglers especially if the price ranges for awhile and you reload the grid every night. If the price suddenly drops the next day you are stuck with multiple danglers. One posted mod has a TP on the average down order and the limit grid but the average price then is continually going up as TP's are taken making it hard to catch up to the average price. The last variation posted makes a lot of sense. It keeps the average price as low as possible while still allowing for additional pip gain profits. Contrary to the original method I think that picking your initial entry is crucial. Waiting until an unwind is several months old will save you thousands of pips in drawdown. Can it go down further? Sure it can. Nobody can pick a bottom. Look at AUD/JPY. It has gone down 2000 pips in the last two months and may go further. Getting in now will have saved you the initial 2000 pip drawdown and may be the difference between making money and a margin call. Keeping an eye on fundamentals and waiting for the big boys to get back on the carry bandwagon may be the way to go. Bob

This strategy will definetely give you an ulcer ... The only thing that will save a portion of your account is Margin Call ... If you are using this strategy, you're better off going in the opposite direction, pay the interest, and it will, inevitably sooner or later unwind. That's when you can collect the rewards.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I have been trading this method for about six months now, as almost everyone is saying it is very risky but if you have good money management you will survive big falls like the recent ones. I have about 20 open positions and about 20% drawdown.

14 September * 32 positions open * Average 195.606 * Bought friday the 12th at 190.182 (540 pips from average) * $1254.99 Interest from swap * Current price is 193.538 (210 pips from average) * Drawdown 7.36% Massive spike on friday from 185.900 to 193.500 (760 pip spike) This just saved this strategy. Max drawdown I experienced was 34%. If I had started at 214 when the unwind started I would have experienced a higher drawdown. I would not play this strategy on multiple categories. Hopefully I can sell out soon with a profit.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
sold: thank you for your demonstration; keep it up now if I were to trade this strategy I would go for: 1. the broker with the highest leverage 400:1 2. the broker with the highest interest payout then I would look at highest fall in the past in this pair and calculate the number of open orders for that time and the margin involved. next I would look at the highest pip loss concerning those open orders. accumulated interest during that time at todays discounted interest total outlay (margin + losses - interest) x 2 x2 = to be still in the game if the drop is 2x worst scenario in the past. this last figure is not more than 50-75% of leveraged account. starting capital $ 10,000 - leveraged account is 400 x $ 10,000 = $ 4,000,000. after all these figures I will know how high my order size is going to be. if there`s nothing wrong with my story, I will dive deeper into this. any threads which go deeper into this money management thing with very high leverage? thank you for any help

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Yes higher leverage will mean higher interest payments. But with this strategy it is also the road to self distruction as you will go through your margin a lot quicker. I am doing this strategy on a 1:50 leverage and experienced 36% drawdown. On a 1:400 my test account would have been toast. If you try to calculate the margin requirements on past trades you will find out that you will trade very small lots and the interest will than erode. So it is small lots and high levergae or bigger lots and less leverage.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I'm always amazed how people mix up leverage with margin requirements... You don't use a leverage of 50:1. If you do that your account would be vaporized within days... But you use an account leverage of 50:1 which defines your margin requirements. If you have a broker which offers 400:1 this is better for that kind of system because you need less margin for the same position sizes. Therefor the margin call comes later... If you open a position with 0.1 lot, it's always the same, no matter if your broker offers 10:1, 50:1 or 500:1. The pip values (in dollar) are the same, only the margin requirements are different... Guys, these are very, very basic things...

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Xaron, thanks for the head-up. I thought the same as you do, but being quite new to forex I was not 100% sure. My opinion was that with 400:1 leverage you can put a lot more orders in than with 50:1, provided the order size is the same. You will have a lot more funds exposed to the interest difference and when the unwinding happens, you can average down with a lot more orders before a margin call. Risks are not greater with the higher leverage: if carefully managed the higher leverage will be an advantage.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
All true, yonnie.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Yes I can see your points here. However do not use the increased leverage to play larger lots. In case of this strategy which started at 1% trading lots (2 trades of 0.5%) for a 1:50 account leverge (all you can get at oanda ). If you go for 400:1 leverage the % size should be adjusted downwards to 0.0125% If you keep it at 1% you will experience a quicker margin call. Might give give it a try. Need demo account with good swap rates and low pips and high leverage. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
sold, yes, the unit size would need to be the same in both scenario`s. FxPro .com has 500:1, but if their interest rates are any good I dont know. I suspect that with my "strategy" you probably can only expose 5% of the margin at the most on a regular basis earning interest, because you would need so much in reserve for when a severe unwinding comes. I think it would be better to learn how to handle a hedge or get out at the first sign of troubles. Just my thoughts

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Done some research. It is about the right mix of: * leverage * roll over interest * pips * minumum amount of margin required per trade. Just looked at FXCM which has 1:200 leverage. On a 100K account the minumum margin required per trade is $500 which would mean a 0.5% trade. This is equal to a 2% on 1:50 leverage. I would be in worse DD than I am currently with OANDA. So where to find a high leveraging account with lower margin requirements per trade.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
I think the problem with carry trade and grid systems is that on the way up you`re in with a few positions to take advantage of a favourable tail wind. You cant have a large position at that moment, because you need a lot of margin in reserve for when the down times come. In a downtrend you`re in with a ever growing postion exposed to a detoriating market.

To perfect the strategy: Looking at hedge with 0% swap provider. Crownfx but did not hear very good storeis about them. Looking at broker with high interest, higher leverage and no minimum order limit. Pretty hard as these are parameters that brokers make their money. Currently oanda pays 4.05% on GDP/JPY with 1:50 leverage and no minimum order. ODL has 1:100 leverage with 2.45% on swap and no minimum order, 6pip spread and you can use metatrader. With similar lotsize the interest would be less but the drawdown as well. With a double lotsize you would get slightly more interest with a same risk profile for margin call. So help me out here with finding the perfect brokers for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Well started the 17th of August. So about 7.5% this month. By removing the limit order ladders from the original strategy I had to find a selling point higher than the average position of all my orders. My selling target was at average plus 100 pips. I was glad to sell out as I had almost 20% of my account in trades. With fewer positions I might sell out at average plus 200 pips. I am revising my strategy over the weekend to lower my drawdown.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
great job, let me know if I can do anything to help. i had a great week, but I still think most of it was LUCK as I am still refining my strategy and or systems from the ideas here

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I have applied this strategy to my LIVE account in Oanda with some twist, since this strategy is quite similar with my original strategy the difference is using market order and buy order , I can;t really give exact return, but based on the % return, last week, just GBP/JPY return, is around 2.4% for a week, this week i'll compute in few days time . My strategy : 1. always put buy order 10--20 pips above market price , 2. TP ==always ==22pips 3. buy order always at xxx.11/33/55/77/99/ 4. some time when the trend is strong, i'll open another set at xxx.00/22/44/66/88 (dun ask me why 22 or 11 , somehow i just like this type of number, and easier to enter through keyboard) 5. I always use 0.5% of NAV, but i used a fixed value unit, 6. I checked the market several times a day , so whenever there;s downtrend, I'll add more buy orders. 7. You may say this is crazy as there will be lot of "danglers" , yes, u're right. But I capitalised these strategy on UPTREND or RANGE market, so during this 2 market ,I'll try to maximize my profit , so the balance grow quite fast . While in downtrend , need to stay alive. so if have EA, it should profit with all "uptrend", 8. This straregy mustn;t be greedy by open large lot, the large lot will kill the account in downtrend . 9. Currently, I'm applying this to EUR/JPY and EUR/USD and just started on EUR/TRY. Thanks for sharing . Comment+feedback are welcome. thanks

This strategy will not work with a MT4 broker, as the rounding effect will kill your account. I commend you for surviving soldintime, but the first entries, in this last unwind actually started the last 2 days of July, about 1000 pips higher than your initial entry, and the only method that might have survived this unwind from the beginning, is if you didn't place another order until at least 300 pips below the averaged entry. As each day, for about the 1st 5 or 6 trading days, it stayed right around the 100 pip level, so you entered each day, which is what killed my demo account right around the 192 mark. I placed 2 .5% trades each day, with tp 13, and next 1 trade at each 20 pips, so only 1 dangler a day, unless price went straight down from the entry, which did happen. So, in my observation, the only way this will work, is use Oanda (more accurate trades, because of no minimum, and higher interest paid), and only open 1 trade per day (if you choose to do the ladder, make sure you take into account the spread, so only 1 dangler a day), and only if over 300 pips from your averaged in price.

What do you mean with rounding?

Still finding the right broker with 1:100 leverage and good interest payments. I have setup 8 sub accounts with OANDA all funded with 100K USD except the original GBP/JPY strategy which has 107K in it. All have 1:50 leverage. AUD/USD - buy 2 0.5% lots AUD/JPY - buy 2 0.5% lots EUR/USD - buy 2 0.5% lots EUR/JPY - buy 2 0.5% lots NZD/USD - buy 2 0.5% lots GBP/USD - buy 2 0.5% lots GBP/JPY - buy 2 0.5% lots - account with 107K GBP/JPY (account 2) buy 2 0.33% lots - to limit the drawdown. I will try to report once a week.

soldintime: May I ask a question regarding your position sizing? You state that you take two lots each worth 0.5% of NAV. Why not one lot worth 1% NAV or 4 lots worth 0.25% NAV each? Is there a reason for the two lots rather than simply sizing by % NAV? DrZ

Hey, I have been following this thread with great interest, I have read the entire thread and the orignal one on oanda forum.

Just got back from holiday. Well the massive unwinding of AU, NZ has effected the accounts. (10% drop in one day for the aussie). Some will blow up in the next few days. AUD/JPY - 73% drawdown on 20 trades. Averaged in when difference was 100 pips. AUD/USD - 73% drawdown on 24 trades. Averaged in when difference was 100 pips. EUR/JPY - 31% drawdown on 20 trades. Averaged in when difference was 100 pips. EUR/USD - 19% drawdown on 24 trades. Averaged in when difference was 100 pips. GBP/USD - 14% drawdown on 20 trades. Averaged in when difference was 100 pips. NZD/USD - 31% drawdown on 18 trades. Averaged in when difference was 100 pips. GBP/JPY - 39% drawdown on 24 trades. Averaged in when difference was 200 pips. GBP/JPY (0.33% positions instead of 0.5%). 29% drawdown on 24 trades. Averaged in when difference was 200 pips. So AUD is toast. I think these accounts will blow up soon. Other pairs still have some hope.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Quick update. Both AUD accounts have blown up. The AUD drop was sharp and brutal. All other accounts still alive and existing max drawdown about 40%. I will update once more accounts have blown or I have returned to profit. This strategy needs only 5 mins of work each day so I continue to show it as a learning exercise for the forex community. However Carry trade is dead with interest rates unwinding and this strategy is not for me. I am focussing my time on finding EAs out there that have continued to be profitable during the last few months of volatile currency movements.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
My first GBP/JPY account has blown up all other account show 50-80% drawdown. This will be my last post on this thread. Carry trade is dead.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I think you're right... It's always better to trade with the market, than against it!!! A simple and effective approach is to follow the trend and jump in on pull-backs. However, be ready to close out the trade within 50 - 100 pips if the pull-backs seem to be developing into a trend in the opposite direction (news events will help to substantiate a trend reversal as well).

I'm not saying this to brag, but since I left this method I've experienced the best performance in my FOREX trading thus far, using a few simple breakout systems. The key is working on yourself--knowing your system(s) (variance in returns and drawdown vs. risk) and working on your discipline with placing trades each and every time with stop losses and with consistent money management. Happy Trading, Glen

It's amazing how much my perception of these markets, as well as my respect for them, and fear of them, has improved since I've discovered this system.. and followed along on this thread. Though I followed the thread, and cheered everyone's progress, and helplessly watched everyone's demise during the un-wind, I 'm glad that I took the time.And I'm a better trader for it by FAR. Well, I too got blown-up. Just like everyone else. But I took what I learned, a bit of determination, a LOT of stubborness, and the ability to THINK about the markets, not the charts...the markets, which I learned from this thread, and I've developed a sort-of variation on this method. Sort-of. It's price action driven. So far in testing, it's extremely profitable. Weathered last week's melt-down just fine....not without a little trepedation, but we made it. Anyway....for my friends on this thread... as well as my friends on FF...I'm forward testing in demo as I type. 2 weeks down &amp; going forward. Target for live is mid-January sometime. I'm in the process of writing the specific instructions, methodology, and thought process behind each of my actions. This might take some time. Maybe I'll send it out in sections. But, at any rate, it needs to be readable &amp; reasonably understandable.....which it ain't, yet. I'd love to share. My pay back for the education I got here this past spring &amp; summer. I'd love some help for refinement. So far, I'm up 6000+ pips, with open position of -440 pips &amp; account equity of +5531 pips.....on 5 pairs only (both long side as well as short) &amp; 1 position only per pair. Max DD last week was -2700 (un-wind). Usually around -1100 or less up to around -1600. We'll see what testing brings. Not increasing lot size as of yet. Need a reliable baseline for growth. I think I've got a winner here. It's 100% money management. The market can do whatever it wants. This method reacts to what the market DID, not tries to guess what it MIGHT, but probably WON'T do. Anyone interested, you're more than welcome. Let me know. Peter O

Did anyone survive using this system so far ???

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi Schminner, I think no-one survived. The draw-down during the Sept.-Oct. unwind wiped-out everyone's account. I know of some who went live with this. Man, I hope no-body got hurt too badly. You had to throw a ton of $$$ to reduce negative position, but eventually came back bigger &amp; better...&amp; richer!. Till now. In the begining, last spring &amp; through the summer, this method was a profit machine, and I could see the temptation to go live prematurely - you couldn't FORCE this method to lose money, but this particular method couldn't keep up with the free-fall the markets were taking. I'm still a believer in the core fundamentals of this. I've been testing various methods to try to mitigate draw-down. We'll see. Time will tell. Good Luck Peter O

In Aphids EA, what does the Delta setting do?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
I think we might now have a good time to start carry trading again. I stopped carrying as the AUD/JPY was around 95 somewhen in spring 08. But now after that heavy drop of 40% I'll reactivate my carry grid again.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Why not to close it when you are in time? I think one should be ready to accept losses... money management shall be added to this system. Havent you learn yet that without a hard stoploss you are going end up dead sooner or later???

This strategy looks very promising and it needs little work. I got the part with placing the orders above the entry but i am still in doubt what should i do if market makes a huge move agains me. Lets say i enter long usd/jpy at 90.00 i place orders all the way up to 94.00 . I get away from my PC and when i come back 4hrs or so later i see the market is now at 88.00. Wow now i am in a very bad position. What should i do can you please explain me in details. Thanks!

Seems not to be very active this thread anymore, nevertheless i recently found this system and since i like technical system i tried to understand it. so maybe someone is still answering me .. as i understood the long strategy buys everey 10 pip 1 contract with tp 10 pips, that means in avg. you are going to be long 2 contracts in uptrending market. so what's the difference if you simply buy the first @market, the second you buy @+10pips and thats it ... i don't see any difference exept your broker isn't that happy because you're trading to littel ... or am i missing smth?

Hello Dreamliner. I find your system simple and very straight forward. I like it. However I do have three questions: Why you go long only? If the trend is short you stay aside? Why? Krom

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Krom, because it was a carry trade system originally so you get positive interest all the day. Actually it was a simple grid based on the concept that the money will flow to currencies with higher interest rates. That did work some years but stopped during the financial meltdown.

I want to ask if the carry trade is still profitable or not?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
My guess is no, too risky

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Why do you think that carry trade to risky? Anyone have experience about carry trade? thanks for your kind explanation.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Hey guys. First a disclaimer: I'm a noob and only started learning about forex about 3 months ago, so many of my assumptions may be incorrect. The main reason this system has been unsuccessful is because of overleveraging to a point where it cannot sustain the market's long-term trends. I was pondering on this today and came up with a few ideas to try to remedy this problem, but they are currently just that - ideas. I'm hoping you guys can help me smooth out the edges and forward/backtest the result in the hopes of making it a much more viable and profitable system. Unfortunately in between study and work, I have very little time to go through years of data for optimization. So my aim was to keep this system a consistent earner, while lowering overall risk to as close to zero as possible. The following ideas are all dependent on the hope that XAU/USD will not drop more than...say for the purpose of this explanation, 75,000 pips; which is well more than 50% of it's current value. If it does...margin call (note that I know nothing about gold, I'm just assuming it's a safe bet and wouldn't plummet that far, and that in the long-term, it will always be bullish; if I am wrong, please correct me, and I'm sorry for wasting your time). Now, these next numbers aren't set in stone, I'm just using them as an example. Let's buy in increments of 100 pips (or 500, whatever), with TPs the same and no SL, in the same fashion as the original system. As the market eventually inevitably goes against you, you only reenter every 10,000 pips, and then start incrementing up again. This means if we use a risk model of 20% per 50,000 pips, and a maximum of 5 reentries, we could weather a drop of over 75,000 pips ( I think...:S ). [Just clarifying - you would risk 20% of your account for every 50,000 pips the market drops, for each entry.] As per the original rules, close all orders once market price reaches average price. Now there are three potential problems that I can see that would either make or break this system, and I'm hoping you guys can help me figure out if the system would be viable/profitable. 1. Using this risk model, every 100 pips gained would only net you 0.04% (hope that's correct, just did it in my head) of account equity. Of course on the flip side, if my previous assumptions are correct, there is almost no risk. But let's keep in mind XAU/USD is very volatile and moves thousands of pips every day. 2. A reentry grid of 10,000 pips is pretty huge. Price will sometimes inevitably sit between entry levels for days, even weeks - meaning during that time, you make no money. For this system to be viable, we must be in the market incrementing our orders for a significant enough amount of time out of the year. I'm hoping someone can help me work out the details. 3. Rollover costs. Obviously our gains must significantly outweigh the costs. I don't even know how to begin to work out the math, so I'll leave that to someone else. That's pretty much it. Feel free to change anything you see fit, maybe even the currency pair - if the rollover problem is the killer, perhaps go back to a carry positive pair. Once again I apologize for not having everything worked out - I simply don't have the time. Tell me what you think. Thanks C

Hi, I am using this system last six month and it is true that we can make a profit of 10% per month. It is all about money management and using the hedge. I am currently trading in AUD/JPY George

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Sorry but I read that 7 times and I still don't get it. Surely I understand what happens if the market goes up. But what if 2 or 3 Long orders are triggered and than market starts to spike down ? - Do you use Stop Limits ? - How do you protect yourself from loses ? If you'd explain in "plain slow English" I'd appreciate

--- 帖子 #688 ---
But what if 2 or 3 Long orders are triggered and than market starts to spike down ? Sell orders will be there in place below 500 pips equal to total open position. - Do you use Stop Limits ? ( sure, 300 pips) - How do you protect yourself from loses ? Hedge is enabled in my account and it is a major draw down I will neutralize the trade by opening a sell trade and wait for the market to cool down. If you'd explain in "plain slow English" I'd appreciate

Hello, My account is still active in spite of the recent JPY draw down. We have to be alive so that we can participate the game....it is important to me George

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Wow, you've been trading this over a year and a half? Are you trading it live? How is your account doing?

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Dear Dreamliner, Nice to see you here again after a long time. I like your post very much. I am trading in live account with FXCM both in Micro and Standard account. I am not strictly following to the original concept. I like the concept and locking the profit every 10 pips and averaging the positions. I am expecting the large draw down and spike that happened last moth with JPY pairs hence sell orders will be there in place without stop loss and take profit below 500 pips of the current position. And I will make sure that the required equity available to reach there in 500 pips down and trade will be neutralized. In short, the super carry trade concept is good system. Instead of blowing the accounts I may be loosing for the negative side of the carry trade for few weeks. George

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Hey! So this may seem like a really "Noobish" Question to be asking you but I'm new to Forex trading and was look through the systems and I liked the ideas of yours, it seem easy and simple! The problem is Im having a hard time trying to set the profit targets on 10 pips? And just so I understand you set a limit order to the current pair at 10 pips above what you want it to be at and you set a take profit at 200 - 400 and a tailing stop at 10 right? Thanks

--- 帖子 #693 ---
This all reminds me of GBot ( http://www.datatime.eu/public/gbot/ ) Anybody used it wth FX ?

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hi George, This seems to be a good system I have long been looking for a carry trade system that works I feel most of the winning traders in FX use carry trades the thing I am having a problem with is position sizes can you please let me know how you calculate them. Also the unwinding do you handle that as in the first post or do you do it differantly? Regards Ralph

--- 帖子 #695 ---
It is true that professional traders are using carry trades in their portfolio. At any point of time I will be using less than 5% of my equity. I am handling unwinding in a different way. I wont allow my account to close due to unwind and instead of that I am using hedge to stay alive. I am closely monitoring the trend and if the trend is down I will be more careful. George

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Can I suggest that if you're with MB Trading, not to place your initial order as a market order but in between the spread as a limit order. This is because MBT are currently paying for limit orders and therefore makes this system potentially more profitable.

Dear Xaron, What is your opinion to carry AUD/JPY at current levels? George

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hi George, thanks for the reply hedging does make sense. If you use 5% for carry trades what is your preferrd method for the other 95%? Regards Ralph

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hi Ralph, I have tested several systems and strategies last two years. I am not believing in automated systems. As I am following this Super Carry Trade trading system I am able to make profit from both trading and carry interest. Currently I am trading with AUD/USD and AUD/JPY and I stopped to carry AUD/USD once this pair crossed 1.0500 level and still holding AUD/JPY. The uncertainty remains in Forex market now a days due to currency war and natural disasters. Hence, I will keep balance 95% as a cushion to my open positions. If the opportunity strike I will open more positions like that happened last month with AUD/JPY and I closed the positions with 1000+ pips with in one month time frame. I will be holding the unused margin for this kind of opportunities. George

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hi George. Long Term I think you have the right approach. I think it's prudent though to spread the risk. Even if it means paying a little for it. As long as you put yourself in the best position to get paid in the end. By the way I love this line of yours... It is important to me too George. Never risk death. Lets stay alive in this game. Good luck sir.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi 2+2=4ex, Good luck to you too The system may not work for short time frame as we can not expect the market to move all the time in our favor and our main focus is carry trade. My approach is long term as I have a day job and it is not easy to monitor all the trade indicators and signals. George

Thanks for a great thread! Also thanks to those who contribute. I have been following a carry trade-strategy successfully for quite some time, I sell only GBP/AUD, EUR/AUD, GBP/NZD and EUR/NZD (from best to worse). My brokers are Interbank FX and FXCM , both excellent brokers but Interbank FX gives the better carry trade. I prefer Interbank FX because the carry trade is added to the open position on the minute daily when the market close. With FXCM the time the carry trade is added to your account is irregular and as a deposit to your account and not linked to the open position. Three questions: 1. What other currency pairs give a good return carry trading? 2. Is there a website where the carry trade of currency pairs are compared? 3. How are the carry trade of a currency pair calculated? Thanks

--- 帖子 #703 ---
It took me a week; but I finally finished reading this thread. It has been very entertaining. Of course I already knew the contributors were facing a 3 month drop in the carry trade; so it was with much trepitation that I finally read the comments during the drop. Apparently everyone was wiped out, with a few exceptions of those who hedged or dropped out. My sympathy goes out to those who lost money. So what went wrong? Participants were already discusing the posibility of masive drops on G/Y. At .5% NAV, I think they were over-trading their accounts. At .1% they probably would still be in the game; but then they would not have had those masive 10% per month gains. I am a believer in the Carry Trade. I currently favor EUR/AUD on IBFX because of its large swap rate. I also hold some longs in AUD/USD and AUD/JPY. I just don't believe in ladder buy stops; because of too much lost spread and too many hangers. I also don't believe in buying in at an arbitrary 100 or 200 pips on an average. Yes, do buy the pullbacks; but look at your chart for Heaven's sakes. Buy the pullback when it looks like the price is going to go back your way. (Of course if you are trading EUR/AUD everything is upside down). If you make enough pips on one trade then close out that trade and one or two hangers. Keep in mind a one micro lot trade (1 cent per pip) at current price of AUD/USD, can cost $45 if the price drops back down to 60 cents, like it did in 2008. This means if you have 100 hangers at one micro lot each, you need $4,500 available to cover drawdown during a market crash. It does not all have to be in your current account. You can use your credit card to fund your account in an emergency. Keep in mind, after the crash of 2008, it was happy sailing for the next 4 months as the carry trade recovered. Happy Carry Trading to All. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hi Sstone, To figure swap rates go back to page 33 and read comment #487 by Doblece. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I closed out my long trades on AUD/USD and AUD/JPY at a small loss yesterday. It looks to me like they are both in a down trend, eating up more pips than I get paid in swap each day. I am still short EUR/AUD, as it is still in a down trend and pays nice swap for shorting the pair. It has been ranging sideways lately. I figure on shorting it around 1.3400; and closing when it drops to about 1.3000. As long as the IMF has to keep bailing out Euro governments, I figure this pair can stay a winner. Happy Carry Trading! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hello to all carry traders out there in Swap Land, Caution: Pay attention to the interest rates set by the Central Banks. The Carry Trade is based on interest rate differentials. If a Central Bank changes the interest rate on a currency you are trading, it is going to affect the swap and the trend on all pairs involved. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Hi SStone, With FXCM, any trades you close after 5 PM ET (10 PM GMT) will get rollover interest credited or debited, even if the rollover hasn't posted yet. You don't have to wait for rollover to post to close positions. 1. What other currency pairs give a good return carry trading? You have 56 currency pairs to trade at FXCM. You can add /remove symbols from the symbols button at the top of the Trading Station. Video on Rollover The current day’s interest rollover for each currency pair can be viewed in the FX Trading Station itself, by following these steps: Go to the “Simple Dealing Rates Window”, in the upper left portion of the FX Trading Station. The window will be in a spreadsheet format, with multiple columns. “Roll S” and “Roll B” will display the current interest rollover rates for 'Sell' and 'Buy' positions respectively. 2. Is there a website where the carry trade of currency pairs are compared? If you're looking for research, then you may like the DailyFX carry trade report - latest carry trade report . 3. How are the carry trade of a currency pair calculated? Heres an example - When you buy the EUR/USD pair, you are buying the euro, and selling the U.S. dollar to pay for it. If the euro interest rate is 4.00%, and the U.S. rate is 2.25%, you are buying the currency with the higher interest rate, and you will earn rollover -- about 1.75% on an annual basis. If you sell the EUR/USD pair, you are selling the currency with the higher interest rate, and you will pay rollover -- about 1.75% on an annual basis, since you are paying the euro interest rate and earning the U.S. interest rate. Good trading,

I have been following carry trade strategy with mixed results but the last two years have been good. I am now with Oanda but from May 30th the NFA FIFO rule kicks-in. Does anyone have experience or ideas on how to follow a carry trade strategy with the FIFO rule Thanks and Regards Tony M

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Hallo Jason Thank you for your response. My experience with FXCM has always been good. The calculation of the daily carry trade still bothers me. The reason being that I have three forex accounts. One with FXCM (I think the Leverage is 100:1), one with IBFX US (Leverage 50:1) and one with IBFX Australia (Leverage 400:1). With similar trade sizes going short with the GBP/AUD on these accounts on the same date, the daily swop I received was as follows: FXCM $1.21; both IBFX US and IBFX AU $2.30. A hugh difference. I want to consolidate these accounts and because I follow a carry trade strategy, the carry trade I receive is important in my decision. I would like to understand the difference. Please explain it to me. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Hi Leslinetony, I trade with IBFX. They are subject to the FIFO rule also. However, IBFX does the FIFO bookkeeping in their back room. As I trade on the Metatrader Platform, I do not notice the FIFO rule. All my trades look the same as they did before the FIFO rule. I would expect Onanda to do the same, to hide the FIFO bookkeeping in their back room. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Hi SStone, Can you tell us about your carry trade strategy? The GBP/AUD is subject to huge drawdowns like in September of 2008, which blew up many accounts. Do you hedge your positions, or do you use stop losses to protect your account? Do you use a grid, or follow a trend strategy, or support and resistance? I like to trade EUR/AUD which gives me the largest swap rate I have found with IBFX. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hallo Jerrycollie I don't think my strategy to be extra-ordinary. In essence, this is my strategy, most probably similar to the strategy of most carry traders: 1. I only trade currency-pairs that give me carry trade. 2. I use Bollinger Bands, EMA, Stochastic Oscillators, RSI and MOJ as indicators to enter the market. Basically overbought, oversold trusting money to be like the pendulum of a clock. 3. I use the same indicators to determine my take profit and stop loss. 4. 4H timeframe to enter the market, 1H timeframe to exit the market. 5. I trade manually. 6. I use the promise of carry trade to boast my confidence when I need it. 7. When in doubt, I always look at the bigger picture (higher time frames) before doing anything silly, like closing at a loss. 8. I am happy with a lot of transactions and small profits at a time. Not that I don't enjoy the big one every now and then. 9. I try to trust my strategy. I also have an account with IBFX. The GBP/AUD gives the best carry trade, about 25% better than the EUR/AUD. September 2008 had almost the same effect on the EUR/AUD, but it took about three months to give back the loss and if you used the drawdown by shorting the currency, you would have made a hugh profit until now plus getting carry trade all the time. That was a once of thing, but that is the reason trading keeps me on my knees, and I like it. Happy trading.

[quote=Dreamliner;1853994]Super Carry Trade Trading System Hi Dreamliner I read the Knightrider idea in the Oanda forum...I see you added a twist to the original system with the 10 pip TP rule....carry start at 200 pip minus. How about, you open 2 positions: EURUSD and USDCHF , which are almost exacly opposite...(Hedge) As the martket swings 1000 or 2000 pips in either direction you keep on averaging as soon as it turns your way...on that pair....you collect your money. Knightrider is making $, but some folks did their homework and tested back some 10 years...they found a negative swing of 2500 pips a few years back, which could have potentially margined the account. Hedging with 2 pairs, you are basically going nowhere, BUT, you cash profits on swings down and up..and there´s no margin call danger...cause say EURUSD keeps going down, you keep cashing 100 pips or so profits on USDCHF...sooner or later EURUSD will come back enough to recover the majour negative, and you already cashed all those USDCHF winners. Only disadvantage: you loose the advantage of interest...cause one of them is negative...

Just curious if anyone still carry trades? This article jolted my memory of 2007/08 https://www.dukascopy.com/fxcomm/fx-article-contest/?What-Ever-Happened-To-The&amp;action=read&amp;id=1110 I remember that period, lot of trading threads were going on about carry trading and carry trading systems. Some people were getting very rich during that time but I doubt many kept the profits when the market crashed. Did you participate in the carry trade "madness" during 2006/07/08? Do you carry trade? If yes what pair/strategy?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hi, I am still using this method with my own style. I will always keep 1000 pips as cushion for every open position at any point of time. I am trading with AUD/JPY. If the usable margin falls below 95% immediately I will make the payment by using credit card. However, carry trade is not attractive like earlier days... George

Good Day People my name is Atoyebi Stephen and i'm from Nigeria. I have been trading for just about six months so i'm not experienced in forex trading. i was going through one of Forex factory forums during December last year and i read about a discussion on CARRY TRADE STRATEGY, so i tested several pairs that could give me positive swap on my demo account and to my surprise usdidx gave me a daily positive swap that was more than the spread for entering the trade (that is, i waited few minute to the close of the day then, i buy and by 12:00 mid night swap is added and it covers the loss of the trade so immediately market opens i close). I tried it on my real account and made about 2.1 million naira which is about $5,700 before the swap stopped working. The problem i have is after i made withdrawal of about over $1000 which is four hundred and twenty thousand naira i was told i could not withdraw again from my Forex account. My broker told me there was an error with the pair (usdidx) and that after their investigation on my account they might pay me part of the remaining amount. Later on My Broker told me they would not be giving me anything and that i should refund the money i have withdrawn. Some fellow traders advised me to sue my broker, w hat advice can you give me as experienced traders? Below is a screen shot of part of the account history. Attached Image (click to enlarge)
