Hi i found this strategy and it seems interesting, i understand that it says not to use a stop loss but i was wondering could someone make a ea with these rules but add a stop loss, so we could play with it and see if it has potential everything is explained in the pdf i found the pdf here https://c.mql5.com/forextsd/forum/16...ing_system.pdf

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Have you traded this system successfully?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
haven't used it long enough to give you a honest answer, but i have traded it the last week with all wins but that is normal because of the no stop loss just would like to see a ea so i can check how often a big drawdown would come

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Have you made any profits trading your system yourself. would be nice to know if its something already making some good returns and not just hypothetical

--- 帖子 #5 ---
not my system, and my answer is right above you

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you, seems interesting and I think every trader can bring something from this and adapt to the personal trading style.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thank you, very interesting. I' ll give it a try. Best regards, renko

Not very many "perfect set-ups". You could be waitin' a long time to pick up 5 pips. Also, the guy mentioned something about paying affiliate marketing commissions for his "book". Where did you get this?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
What time Frame do you refer to?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
first question mostly asked is " is there an indicator?" second most ask question " is there an ea/" third most is "What time frame?" Common sense is just forgotten

--- 帖子 #11 ---
what is wrong asking for time Frame?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
15 MIN 30 MIN 1 HR 4 HR DAILY WEEKLY 1 PIP 2 PIPS 5 PIPS 20 PIPS 50 PIPS 200 PIPS Note: The chart above shows conservative profit targets only. Obviously more pips can be usually acquired, but the figures above will ensure no-losses; those pips will be gained. Once you become more experienced, increase the pips at your own risk but remain conservative not greedy. For example, 10 pips on the 1 HR chart can usually be gained and 50 pips on the 4HR chart can usually be gained. Avoid however changing the pip ammount on the lower timeframe of 15 min or 30 min. Also, even though the pips gained might seem low, don’t forget that profits do indeed add up over time because of a) frequent set-ups and b) you can trade multiple currency pairs at the same time if you work quickly and c) profits will increase depending upon your lot size and leverage.

I was looking at the H1 charts ... I just entered a trade a few hours ago and the chart is attached. That pic shows it nearly hitting my TP ... you can see that the spread stresses the TP. It went on to win, but I only made ~$16. The setup candles were the 2nd and 3rd candles back from the vertical blue line.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
And that wasn't a "perfect setup" ... obviously.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
EDIT: It is hit TP! how about this setup?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Anybody bothered to read this bit..... This book is copyright protected. Duplication or distribution either for personal or commercial use is prohibited. The method also cannot be transformed into a freely distributable or commercially sold EA (Expert Advisor ).

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Have you checked the copyright website...…..

--- 帖子 #18 ---
i removed the pdf. i did download it for free tho

--- 帖子 #19 ---
First bar, open price match lowest price, not a perfect setup

--- 帖子 #20 ---
A really interesting price action method, not some stupid holy grail indicator and this setup can be visual backtest too, author's website has been downed, hope he dont mind our discussion here. Hope someone can make an simple indicator base on this.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
setup is fine

--- 帖子 #22 ---
pls sir read your PM Thanks

--- 帖子 #23 ---
To tell you the truth the chart is so dark I can barely read anything. Is it kindly possible to have a white background. Regards

--- 帖子 #24 ---
not sure about copyright rules but am i allowed to post a link to where i found the pdf ?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
yes you can post the link as to where you found it, there is no copy right laws about that point

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Also you can re-tell it with your own words. And unless there is a patent on the method, we can make it a program. Anyway there is no world-wide copyright or patent rules.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Years ago, I wrote this EA. Unfortunately, the result was not ideal. I forgot the details of the failure.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Very interesting strategy. I love the simplicity and the fact that you can trade it from your phone without having to use indicators. That said, I think I'll throw together an indicator anyway, firstly to see if I understand the rules correctly, and secondly to be able to maybe set alerts to further reduce screen time (yes, I'm very lazy ). I'll post it here if I get it working OK.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
It is not clear what is being discussed at all! What method was proposed?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
You need to download and read the PDF in the first post.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
that would be great thank you.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thank you! When I started reading, there were no links there! Now read it!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
The link in the front page doesn't work, can someone share the rules here?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
The link works fine.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
the holy grail exists

--- 帖子 #36 ---
can you share indicators and template? Thanks

--- 帖子 #37 ---
EDIT: It is hit TP, floating loss in one day.. new setup..

--- 帖子 #38 ---
You have a bunch of whacky indicators on your chart ... complete opposite of what the pdf says!! Also, your "setups" are highly subjective and they don't result in a profitable trade going in the correct direction. So far I've taken two trades and managed to get two wins. You've got to have a pretty good sized account to be able to make any money with a 5 pip TP. Especially with the spreads . And a LOT of screen time watching and waiting.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
He'll have to write a pdf 'splainin' his methodology ... and it'll not have anything to do with the currency-grail system. Start another thread and toss it around there.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
This strategy is a waste of time.. You can look at any timeframe for literally 10 seconds and I hope you will notice that it is full of BS. Can't believe people place trades based on this pdf.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
i checked your profile all your replies are negative across the threads you post on, trouble in paradise ? im not claiming anything here is going to make you successful just came across it and wanted to see if other could get something out of it.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Relax ... I'm using a demo acct just to check it out. Won a couple so far ... more than I can say about the thousands of other strategies found here.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
PDF looks really fishy and uncredible, not to unmotivate you testing this, good luck

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Fellow traders, remember that this member is sharing his opinion to help, not to smear. Honesty is better than false hope

--- 帖子 #45 ---
LOL ... "false hope"? You've succinctly described the entire FX market (and the U.S. Congress). We have a Food and Drug Admin and we're the fattest nation on the planet because of the garbage the food industry sells. A Drug Enforcement Agency that'll throw you or I into prison for peddling the drugs (marijuana) that the CIA is peddling (only theirs are much more addictive ... like heroin, cocaine or meth). I could go on and on, but I'm sure you got the picture. "False hope" ... LOL. Let people decide for themselves ... it's a pretty simple system.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
back testing this method over two years of data the results are very poor. It would be more profitable to plot a 20ema and trade all engulfing patterns in the direction of the ema.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
at last holy grail reaveal, permanent profit

--- 帖子 #48 ---
yeah, but in the same time can appear setup in all time frames from m15 in just one pair

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hello pls where can i get that Trade manager from in your chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I was just stating, that sometimes a brutally honest opinion may help traders more. Isn't it was this forum is about, though? But yea much you state above might be true^

--- 帖子 #51 ---
A positive note: tenthman; The risk-reward tool you show with screenshot on page 1, seems more interesting than the method, does it work on both mt4 and 5?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I paid $49 for the Premium version. https://www.riskrewardratio.club/ I think it works in MT5 too, but I use MT4. It's good for doing quick calculations for position sizing; I have entered trades and not have my TPs, set up by the software, NOT close out the trade. Not sure if this is the fault of the software or if MT4 is to blame. I've only had it for a couple of months so I can't honestly recommend it.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
As far as I recall that is an MT4 STP/ECN issue. The platform will not pass SL or TP with the initial order, they have to be placed separately. SL and TP can be taken and placed if NOT ECN.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Do any of you have a mql indicator/script on hand which visually shows position margin$ as cTrader provide? This should be basic in MT as well since this is the single most important parameter regarding position sizing and risk management imo

--- 帖子 #55 ---
i spent some minutes made an EA to backtest eurusd 1 year tick data, it seems profitable and i think it however need tuned somehow to work live. for example some orders may last days or weeks before it reaches TP. if i had more time i would add hedge or martingale and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I agree, 1 pip of the 15 minutes it will just waste your time and be eaten up by spread an commisions..

--- 帖子 #57 ---
lowest i would go is the 1 hour chart any chance you could share this ea, try rr of 3 to 1

--- 帖子 #58 ---
EDIT: It is hit TP.. on the way to TP..

--- 帖子 #59 ---
here you are. i simply implemented the set up PDF described, didn't put any stop loss. author however used words like "significantly greater than" which hard to interpret, i just code it the way i comprehend...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
thank you

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Is the EA based on 1h tf?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
i think its 15 if someone can make it with adjustable tp and sl that would be great

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thanks, not using the EA now until it is clear. Trades by hand for now. Looks allright to me, so thanks for bringing it up.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Can you share this system? Please. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Read the forum as everyone else does. Start at post 1

--- 帖子 #66 ---
It's not time-based, so you can use it on whatever timeframe you want. (EDIT: sorry I was wrong, it's coded with a fixed TP of 2 pips, so yes, it's for M15). I'm working on an indicator, initially, that will show the entries. Once I'm convinced I have the rules correctly coded, I'll turn it into an EA.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Dude, please, don't be naive and myopic. You think your trade hit the TP because of the magic pattern? Man, let me tell you one thing: there is no magic pill, no shortcut, and no holy grail. Here is why you profited from this trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) You have been luck. Next time you will not. In this case there was 4 things in confluence in your favour: 1- A strong supply area 2- A psychological level 3- Previous days high that sometimes act as a "wall" 4- 80% ADR All those things together in the same area. This is luck, this is not a magic pattern Do homeworks like all successful traders did, and leave this thread.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Yes, I was read but i only ask this system...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Great. I saw the 2pip tp also but the document stated 1 pip on 15m? The thing my head explodes about is stop loss. Sometimes the pattern doesn't work out. Risk reward ratio is not good. However, sometimes price returns in our favor. To all critics: offcourse there is no holy grail. Just let us talk about it. Btw, on my short backtesting I found that it works often, even when there is no special price level. 1 hour tf seems most reliable though. Better look for a 0 spread broker.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
OK, make of this what you will... I hacked @chenxee's EA a bit, and in doing so, made a small mistake with the order submission logic, resulting in the EA submitting a new order every 3 seconds or so! Realising my mistake, I fixed it, but then thought I'd add an option to trade it this way, and called it High Frequency Mode. I've attached the EA for everyone to play around with, but thought I'd show the results. I ran the EA on EURUSD over a 3.5 year period (Jan 2016-Sep 2019) using quality tick data, and got the following: In High Frequency Mode using lot size of 0.02: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) In normal mode, using lot size of 2.0: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) (That one loss actually hit TP - but was registered as a loss due to swap fees making the closing amount negative) So, for all of the naysayers out there, this strategy does seem to have some merit after all.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
It looks worth it to make an EA dashboard for multiple pairs?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Great job. Looks promissing. If I understand correctly your tp is 5 pips and sl is 100 pips? One can change this to his liking I guess. Is it of any importance that my broker has points instead of pips? If so, I think I need to change settings to tp 50 and sl 1000. According to these numbers, your ea is based on 1h tf correct?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I don't think there's any need for a dashboard if you're going to run it on autopilot - simply have one copy of the EA running on each chart you want it to run for. It'd be worth optimising the parameters for each pair though as they will differ.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
The best SL is actually 135. TP and SL are in pips and the EA adjusts this internally, so you don't have to worry about points. Above results were on H1, yes.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Share with us the timeframe of your test.

My Tester shows loss loss and more loss. Please, show us your settings

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Which settings are you referring to? I've defaulted the parameters to the best settings for EURUSD, with the exception of SL which should be 135 instead of 100.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Could you explain how it could help please? I have no idea how I would apply this to this strategy.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I don't understand if people here want to learn how to trade, or just sitting and waiting for money fall from the sky. The direction that the market takes, depends from a lot of factors, and you can't reduce all in a 2 no-sense decontextualized candles Banks have access to market analysts, mathematicians, programmers etc directly from Oxford making entires Teams that study markets and operative strategies together and they didn't still found the holy grail BUT EHY Here in forex factory with an EA coded in one night basing on two candles, we all will be profitable! I hope seriously all here are joking 5 pips TP and 135 stop loss, do you know what it means? that you need 30 win in a row for recover ONE single loss.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
And you're here, why?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I'm here for let people don't waste money, energy and time in a complete dumb no-sense thing. You are lazy. This is not trading, this is hope to find a short-cut and making money. No shortcut. You have to take the stairs. You think that you are smarter then Oxford analysts and programmers? Keep dreaming bro. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Bye.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thank you very much for shining your light on this. Don’t trade this system if you don’t like it. We allready stated there is no holy grail. So move on to another thread if you are not willing to build up this system. The tests look good. I would like others here to share their thoughts and make the idea better. Offcourse 5 pip reward against 135 pip risk is bad. But did you test it? How many times did price not manage to go this 5 pips in our favour? Sure, we need a lot of winning trades to make up for a potential loss but luckily we can have many many trades running at the same time. So for each losing trade there will be many winning ones, according to the tests. I am willing to try this on a small live account with low spread pairs just to play with it and see how it will do. I love the simplicity of this system. I am always looking for trade systems that don’t require me to sit in front of a screen all day. Maybe I am too dumb and lazy, so be it! I do not need to pay my bills with trading so I gladly test this one. On topic: I think this system can work because we make use of the momentum of a pullback. Maybe we need to figure out how much longer the second wick needs to be compared to the first wick to have a sure win. If wick is at least xxx pips than buy or sell. Might need a setting in the ea for that.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I will not read this wall text. We are talking about 2 candles. In the long term you can't profit without analysis, contextualization and proper risk/management. There are many ways to trade rejections/reversal, this is not the right way. The end.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Bye!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
LOL - ok, now you've gotten that off your chest, I guess there's no need for you to comment further, eh?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I'm following your sentiment here. Yes, the R:R is bad, but with a lot of testing and some additional features such as proper money management and trade management, I'm sure we could build this into something viable. Let me put it this way: I've seen way more complicated systems, requiring lots and lots of indicators, confluence, fundamental analysis and not least of all a good eye and quick reflexes, that don't produce anything like the results that this little system seems to do. One thing that I haven't seen mentioned is that no-one seems to know who the author of this system is, so taking MrDumb95's comments on board for one moment, who's to say that the author didn't study the markets for years, plotting the confluences of various indicators and points on a chart, and then, one day, simply just happened to notice that when this happened, the two candles before seems to frequently (maybe not always) make a certain pattern? Maybe he then did a little back testing and then some forward testing and, hey presto (ooh! magic!) realise he'd stumbled upon a quirk in the charts... A bit far fetched, I know, but hey, anything's possible, right?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Paul, very good work, excellent. when i had first glance at this strategy, i feel author expected this for high hit rate, say, 80-90 out of 100 should hit TP target within reasonable time span. maybe he trained himself a lot to visually confirm the pattern effectively, but in EA we have to quantify it. i think it's the key this system would work coz it highly relies on hit rate. if bad thing happens, for example price go totally against you, then it's martingale show time in my another EA i also add hedge if price moves not in my favour to cash in to add up balance to avoid margin call.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thanks chenxee. You're right about the quantification aspect - I've tested quite a few variations of the two figures and 3 and 2 appear to be the best. This means that the EA takes far fewer trades than the author would perhaps do manually, but if it improves the accuracy, then that's no bad thing. One part of the strategy that is still missing is the minimum size of the open/close distance for the two candles. I've added that into the mix and I'm now running some tests to see if it makes any positive difference (it doesn't so far) in combination with different values for the other two main parameters. I'll post up my findings once the testing is finished (several thousand iterations!).

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I dont like huge risk/reward idea, u can have 10 consecutive wins but always live in fear, thats gambling not trading. I have seen more crazy tester report but that EA still failed when live trading. And some stupid here already thought about making dashboard =)), dont make me laugh. Some advices from me: smaller sl as author suggest (at highest, lowest of previous candle), adding s/r, round number..., follow trend even author dont suggest that. And in the end, consider this as funny project not a potential holy grail.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Yeah, I agree. The author actually says to trade without a stop loss, but that's a huge no-no for me. I've tested using just the additional 5 or so pips the author recommends, and the results are not good. That said, I tried that before adding in the final check that I mentioned above, so I'll be going back to check to see if that makes any difference. I do have money management, break even, trailing stop, positive lot progression features coded and waiting in the wings, and once I've gotten a grip on the core strategy, I'll start exploring ways to reduce the R:R ratio. I'll probably start with trailing stop, as my paper back testing seems to indicate that the majority of trades would actually go to 10, 20, even 40 pips if allowed.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Good idea of trailing stop, was thinking about this as well. Also good idea of The1Student. Hedging for the losses is nice too.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
This is holy grail method or not, i still think this is a great price action setup. Good luck, bro

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thanks for starting the thread and sharing. Really interesting ideas. Also, I suggest an easy change to inputs so user can set the Magic Number. input int magic=88888888; // Magic Number //int magic=88888888; All the best, John

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thanks for the info. The vendors never mentioned that. The broker I use is an ECN broker. Nothing worse than going to bed and waking up to find that your TP was hit but not triggered. The way I use it now is for risk management and TP/SL levels ... then hit f9 and enter the trade there. I'm interested in the grail currency strategy because of its' simplicity. I use it in conjunction with other setups like FXCyborg's three candle set-up, pin bars and engulfing candles (one candle set-ups). Trade on the H1 or H4. Trade 2.0 lots and squeezing out 7 or 8 pips instead of going for the 20 or 30 seems to be a doable thing for me. The money adds up pretty quickly too. Couple trades a day at the most and you've got a nice little pile of moolah!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thank your for share the strategy. It seems really interesting. I am backtesting it in 4H TMF in several pairs and I think that maybe it is not strictly necessary than the 2nd bar size has to be bigger than the 1st one, even with similar bars seems to work nicely, obviously not with big diffs between the 2 bars (the 2nd much smaller) and always respecting the close/high close/low difference between the bars that I think it is the most important point of the strategy together with HH/HL - LH/LL.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Actually, I think that the strategy works better in 1H than in 4H (it is easier to get 5 pips in 1H counter trending than 20 pips in 4H). I saw some cases in 4H that the price never came back to the original entry price.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Could someone please implement a RR factor? For example: SL on Low[1] or High[1], and TP x3 Thanks !

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Right on ... and another thing I like about this kind of trading is you can see pin bars, engulfing candles and you can wait for them to be set-up correctly too. A heck of a lot easier looking for 10 pips than it is hoping for 30 or more. Get in the trade and if it goes against you GET OUT! If it goes your way, 10 pips isn't unreasonable.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
PaulDV, which TF did you use for Testing?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
His EA is based on 1h tf.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Th defaults are set for H1, but you can change the parameters and use it for any other timeframe.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
try these setting on eurusd h1

--- 帖子 #109 ---
79% over nearly 4 years...not great TBH: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I've added in the last rule of the author's strategy which is to exclude setups where the closing 'wick' or opening 'wick' is below a certain size (updated EA is attached). I've run several thousand tests to ascertain optimum settings for EURUSD on H1, and, while there are 'better' results using larger stops (and hence more risk), I have settled on the following settings as probably being the most optimum: Attached Image The risk has been reduced from the previous 135 pip stop down to a 50 pip stop. While this is still 10:1, I've seen many other EAs with much worse that don't measure up to this little one's performance. These settings give the following results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) So, a 168% gain over nearly 4 years, without any compounding, at a 99.4% win rate, and a drawdown of under 12%...not bad in my opinion!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
the win rate is so high 10:1 shouldn't be much of a problem is it possible to add risk % instead of lot size, by the way i would like to thank you for making these EA

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Money management will be one of the new additions, so it can compound, but a trailing stop will be next, as this may allow us to reduce not only the trigger bar ratio (and hence increase the number of trades) but may also allow us to reduce the SL further.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Same settings as before, but not using the high frequency mode, and a lot size of 5: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've managed to take the lot size up to 15 lots per 10,000 (on a 500:1 leveraged account) without any problems, and the return was 790%...stupid figures, I know, and I wouldn't suggest anyone trades with that much risk, but it does show what this little EA can achieve.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I would advise to trade this on H1 and hedge at -50pips and release the hedge at the first next D1 signal to get to break even as D1 will almost surely provide a 50pips tp.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thank you for EA. You can make backtest with small deposit? Like $250?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
The results will be the same providing you use the correct lot size. High frequency mode requires a minimum balance of around $2000 per 0.01 lost to avoid a margin call, so you would need to turn high frequency mode off. With high frequency mode off, and leverage of 500:1, you ought to be able to use 1 lot per $1000, so a $250 account ought to be able to use 0.25 lots.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thank you. EA have very big potantial. I make backtest some pairs. Very good except XAUUSD. Can you check XAUUSD?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I'm concentrating on EURUSD for now, but will move on to other pairs once I'm happy with the features and the results. Of course, there's no reason why others can't do some testing on other pairs...

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Would be realy nice if someone could write an Indicator for that setup. We could easily spot setups on all instruments for example on the dailies in some minutes.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
A word about risk when using this EA... Although we have reduced the stop loss from 135 pips down to 50 pips, due to the way in which the author has specified the stop placement for this strategy, the actual stop is usually far more than 50 pips! This is because we are placing our (fixed) stop above/below the high/low of the previous candle, and that high/low could be many tens of pips from the current price - so it's entirely possible that one trade will have a stop of, say, 80 pips and the next could have 65 pips. So while the reward when using this strategy is fixed (at 5 pips), the risk actually varies from trade to trade. In my opinion, this is bad as an unexpected loss could have very unwanted hit on the account. I mention this now, because I have built a new EA that uses money management, and this has the reverse effect: the risk stays constant, but the reward changes depending upon the size of the calculated stop loss. So, while the overall return fluctuates, and could therefore be less than using fixed lots, due to compounding, the result usually ends up being better. The one thing that using money management brings home, is the amount of risk required to run this EA... e.g. in previous tests, I was using a fixed lot size of 5 with an account balance of $10,000; to achieve roughly the same result using money management, this equates to an average risk of 25%...per trade! So, in summary, I would like to warn everyone who is thinking of using this EA, that it poses a considerable risk to your account should it not perform as it has in the past.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
As mentioned above, I've built a new EA for this strategy that can use money management and trailing stops, and I thought I'd show some early results from this. Normal Mode; $10,000 balance; Fixed lots of 5.0 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, there appears to be a single loss in this version, however this is down to swaps and the trade actually hit TP. Normal Mode; $10,000 balance; Money Management 25% risk per trade (equates to the above settings risk-wise) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Normal Mode; $10,000 balance; Money Management 25% risk per trade; Trailing Stop (previous high/low) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) So, we have gone from a return of 260% over 3 years to 1229%...that's way better than most hedge funds manage - but the risk is pretty darned big!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Awesome when do we get to try this new ea ?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Unbelievable results...thank you very much, Paul ! Though just 118 trades in 4 (?) years, hence we need some other profitable pairs as well for more trades. So I did some quick backtests with your unadjusted settings 5/50 and got the following Profit Factors for last 2 years: AUFJPY 2.8. USDJPY 1.9, NZDCHF 1.8, GBPUSD 1.7, GBPNZD 1.7, CADJPY 1.6 and EURJPY 1.5. Very probably the settings need to get adjusted/ADR-based in order to achieve similar results with other pairs too. Stay tuned, jdva

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Here are the preliminary results from the high frequency mode. Due to the volume of orders, break even and trailing stop functionality is restrcited (otherwise the EA simply locks up as it can#t react quick enough with the volume of orders!). HF Mode; $10,000 balance; Fixed Lots 0.02 (equates to 5 lots in Normal mode) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) HF Mode; $10,000 balance; Money Management 0.1% risk per trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) HF Mode; $10,000 balance; Money Management 0.1% risk per trade; Trailing Stop (previous high/low) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) So that's a return of 305%, 1166% and 1741% respectively!

Just ironing out some minor kinks and tidying things up first.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Actually it's just 3 years (my mistake). I only spotted this morning that although I'd specified to use data from Jan 2016, it actually started from Jan 2017, so slightly less than 3 years. Based on the EURUSD results above, with only 118 trades, those figures are pretty remarkable, and you could probably use just this one pair forever. But I will begin some optimisation for other low-spread pairs shortly and see if we can get anything similar.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Remember, MQL backtesting report is easily manipulated with both '90 and 99%'. Unreliable as an indicator of the future. Products sold based on those reports are a bad memory for most traders. (not to imply this is a selling thing, cuz I see it aint, just free and sharing, which is otherwise very nice, just don't get ur hopes up with those reports)

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hello PaulDV, would you please let me know where I can find the EA for testing. Thank you, renko

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hope this helps. This nifty Bargain Index tool from MaryJane will help find best low spread pairs. The higher the index number the lower the spread.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
The backtest of MT4 isnt viable, see screenshot below. That entrance pass over 50 pips, but in backtest count gain in day 30, and reach stop loss before that and the MT4 doesnt count as a loss.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Almost every NZD pair is giving signal right now...let's see how it works...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Sorry but you're wrong...the candle dips over 6 pips from the open, hitting TP after about 15 minutes. Also, the SL for that trade would have been roughly 75 pips (the high of the previous candle is roughly 25 pips plus the additional 50 pip SL).

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Paul, you are a star. eager to have a look at your EA and learn some your MM. let's make this EA better and better.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Impressive job with the EA, thank you PaulDV. I am checking the system manually with a home made indicator in several pairs. One question, did your EA entered long in EURUSD 7 March 2019 13h (GMT+1)? Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Yeah, I know it's not HFT, it's just the term I used to differentiate between the method of order submission.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
No, it ignored that setup.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thank you. I will try to tune in my indicator (I don't use MT, I use Tradingview). It gives me 64 good entries in 2019 but 3 bad (EURUSD-1H). Almost the same results in EURJPY for example, 63 - 3.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hey Paul you are doing a great job here. When are we expecting to test out the new EA?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi PaulDV, Thank you for all your work and sharing a remarkable EA. A couple requests: 1. Please add the Magic Number so users can set it, and make it print in the Comment for each trade. For testing purposes, the magic number can tell us which result came from which setting. 2. Change the TP and SL to points instead of pips. Different pairs have different ranges in different time frames. Food for though. Quick experiments with different ratios and all with lot size = 5 and TP = 5: First chart is bar ratio of 2 and 1.9. Second chart is bar ratio 3 and 1.9. Third chart is bar ratio 1.5 and 1.0.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
A few results from 1.5 &amp; 1. Also tried "High Frequency".

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Looks like a person could get rich running "High Frequency" mode on 10 low spread pairs with TP = 1 pip. Approximately, 50% profit on each trade. How many drops of water to make the ocean? The broker love all the commissions.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I hope these tests are incorporating broker commission, spread and swap. Since the TP is so low I’ve seen similar EAs perform the same when these things are not considered.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Those were manual trades taken using the scp_indi2?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Paul I must say amazing job, looks promising. But I have a question if you know why are my results so different from yours? I'm also using 99.9% tick history, and its so much difference in results? I have same setting as you and get this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also I have setup my VPS with 2x 30 pairs with the ea one in normal mode and one in HF mode, and no trades were take for past 4 hours?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
In a word: Spread. You are testing with a fixed spread, and because spreads are key for this strategy, you have to utilise variable spreads, so will need to use a third party test tool, such as Tick Data Suite. I'll upload a version that allows a zero stop loss - I've been testing it and the results are actually quite surprising!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
New version of @chenxee's EA. This version allows the SL to be set to zero...I hate the idea of trading without a stop, but give it a go - you may be surprised!

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yeah I've found out why this happened. I am using TickDataSuite(free trial though if it makes any difference)? And made a fresh mt4 Dukascopy terminal and used a variable spread, and this are the results. Still not as yours but better. I am testing from 4.1.2016. And you have 1 more year right? And I have 16000 more trade in 1 year less? Also I have setup my VPS with 2x 30 pairs with the ea one in normal mode and one in HF mode, and no trades were take for past 4 hours?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
They do.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Which broker did you use?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I like your thinking! The thing that is starting to become clear about this strategy (and this little EA) is that there could be so many ways in which to trade it and still be profitable, and the 'salami slice' approach could actually end up being the best long term.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
IC Markets - zero spread on EURUSD most of the time, but you pay commission.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Please can you kindly explain how to use the "Salami slice" approach with this strategy. Thanks.

Hi. Thanks for EA. It's almost to good to be true if we look backtest, but it means not much before we see forward test. But we'll see soon enough. However when I try to backtest with TP 1pips I get "order send error 130". Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thanks! Can you share the EA with money management function? Great job your doing Paul

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi MJV, Check the Experts and Journal tabs. Could be you're over your broker's limit for number of open orders.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
That means "Invalid Stops". Does it only happen on 1 pip TP or does it happen regardless of TP?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Read PaulDV's first post where he mentions "High Frequency". You too can help experiment with the settings and report back to everyone. Turn on "High Frequency"; pick a Lot Size; pick a TP. Start Auto Trading.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
it happens just on TP 1pips. With TP 2pips I get error 148 but after that open orders. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #177 ---
148 means too many orders, which is understandable, but I'm not sure why you're getting 130.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Paul, I mean this one. EA with trailing stop function and % risk setting

Hi Paul, great EA. Could you implement max spread filter to prevent EA to take trade when hot news out?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Is the EA opening trades for you guys? I have it running on default whole day and no trade opened on normal or HF mode.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Are you backtesting or forward? And what time frame ? the larger the time frame the longer it will take for a setup to form. also, I believe CHF pairs and EURGBP may be the best pairs as they wick A LOT more than others, but watch the spread !

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Forward. I have 28 + 2x gold setup on two terminals normal and HF. No trades opened on HF yet. I know that on normal it wont happen that often.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
check your journal for the ea. Clear it first and then come back 10 minutes later to see. Perhaps there’s an error opening trades. and don’t be greedy just test it on one pair for now. There’s no need to go all 28 pairs. Specially if you do high frequency your account won’t have nearly the margin it needs to work on one chart let alone 28.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
No, not manual trades. scp_indi2 is set to match EA so I can visually check and confirm EA's trades. The lower threshold for ratio settings means more trades in same time frame. You can see: 1. with bar ratio = 2 or 3 and wick = 1.9 there are very few trades in a week. 2. with bar ratio = 1.5 and wick = 1.0 there are many more profitable trades in a week. And, as SOGabillions has confirmed in post # 181, turning on "High Frequency," "salami slicer," will flood your account with small profitable trades. Have to work out TP with EA. If PaulDV can change the TP and SL to points it might help.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi SOG, How do you like the "salami slicer"? Great you tried it. Thanks for posting your results. Pretty amazing EA isn't it? You could try TP of 1 or 2 so the EA will auto-close when hits TP.

Hi Degolep, Try these settings below, also check SOGabillions post #181, scp EURUSD,H1 inputs: Lots=0.10 ; TriggerCandleRatio=1.5 ; TriggerHLRatio=1.0 ; TriggerCloseRatio=0.07; TP=1 ; SL=50; HFMode=true;

tp = 1?? Like is that even considering spread, commission or swap ??

--- 帖子 #194 ---
EA opened multiples trades at the same signals. Is this normal?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
seems like a bug to me. EA should not reopen same signal trades ...

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Just a suggestion. 1 pip = 10 points. Adjust for your broker and how you want to trade. Then let everyone know how things went.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Thank you for the strategy, this one very similar to my method. I am using H1 and enter trade at 59'52s on current H1 bar which make D1 high/low. I have stoploss in place but very good RR and winrate if you use on specific session. Normally I escape 1/2 trade on 1R and let 1/2 run for more profit, if SL hit, it could be break even trade.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Somebody can share with results of testing

--- 帖子 #199 ---
One SL erases the profits of fifty PTs.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Focusing on weekly tf and getting 5 or a little above 5 signals may be a nice way to go

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I've got the "salami slicer" going on. But is this normal opening at the same time 2 or 3 trades? Also why it doesn't open the default trades but we can back test them?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
There is no Weekly tf in strategy tester so I went for the Daily. This is is from 16.5.2016. 1259 calendar days – 360 days skipped: Excluded 180 Saturdays Excluded 180 Sundays Result: 899 trading days So on average would be 9.5 trades per day or 40 per week. Default settings with TP 5 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Defaults settings with TP 10 pips. It almost doubled the profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #203 ---
That's normal - that's how the "high frequency" mode works. It's actually a bug that I turned into a "feature" to see if it had any merit, and isn't really part of the official strategy.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
No, it doesn't - that's not how this EA works. If you use the HF mode, you get multiple orders for the signal bar and, due to the ebb and flow of the price, you end up with closing many, many orders so that, if for some reason the remaining few lose, they are offset by the winners in that bar.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Yes, that's normal for the HF mode.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
That's because, when using the default settings, the EA is a 'sniper' and takes one trade approx. every two weeks. To get more frequent trades, the settings will need to be tweaked (as I think you've now found).

--- 帖子 #207 ---
What does spread have to do with it? If your broker has a spread of 2, and you're looking for a 1 pip profit, then the price simply needs to move 3 pips in the right direction. Commissions and swaps are factored into the test that people have been showing, so it does appear to be profitable at that setting.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
After testing the Daily tf I didn't see that the EA has been opening only sell orders, PauldDV do you have any idea why is that? Funny stuff is that it won 100% of the time . Maybe a new bug that has become a feature

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Care to share? In the pdf it also says that the author enters a trade seconds before candle close.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hmm...have you checked the dates for the orders? I put the indicator on a Daily chart and it only shows 2 triggers in that period of time, so it's possible that all of those orders are for just two days. Not sure why they would all be short though.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
After testing with other pairs, i found that to trade HF you need around 10k to be able to trade HF with sufficient equity and not getting stopped out.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yeah you are right only two days.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Please what setting parameters do you suggest?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
What does it really do ? I do understand that it is a bug but can you say when it will be triggered ?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
@paulDV Could you please explain a bit why the numbers of trades is falling if you up the lot size? I would just like to understand it better. I like it that this happens but I would just like to know why. This is from 1.1.2019 0.01 lot it had 21472 trades Attached Image (click to enlarge) 0.1 lot it had 14279 trades Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1 lot it had 3457 trades Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I turned it into a mode of operation. The "Normal" mode simply submits one trade when it gets a signal; but in HF mode, when a signal is triggered, the EA continually submits a new order for the first 3 seconds of every minute for the duration of the candle.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I'd have to see the journals, but I would guess that you're hitting margin limits for your broker, which is stopping additional orders from being opened.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Again you were right. Thank you. Gonna test it some more.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
PaulDV would it be possible to make an EA with HF trading with 50% less trades or something? Under 10k it's unrealistic to run this EA. So maybe instead of 3 seconds fixed you could add an option that we could chose on how often the EA adds orders? So we could test it out to find something worth running and reliable. EDIT: Best solution would be to make it optional times between what time it should trade. So we can avoid high spreads after market close and start of tokyo session. And we can have it turned on only during London session when spreads are the lowest. We hit two birds with one stone. Could you add that? Also this are todays trades taken by EA everything default. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I also had the salami slicer running on and set to lot size 1. Does anybody have any indicator to show profit with only specific lot size? I wan't to see only lot size 0.01 and exclude 1.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
What do you think about having SL and TP as a fixed ratio based on ATR range for the pairs we trade?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
This is weird. My EA is not placing any trades since I added it to Eurusd yesterday. Did I overlook something?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post12635557

--- 帖子 #223 ---
That's not really part of the base strategy, so I won't be adding that feature myself. Personally, I think the base strategy is sound as it is, and is profitable exactly as it is, so don't see any need to tune it further - it can already make lagre returns, and anything more would simply be being greedy imho. However, if you're keen on having that, then the source for the EA is attached to this thread, and you could always create a version with that feature.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yeah, the HF mode is a little erratic and unpredictable, and I've noticed large numbers of trades having the exact same entries, which I personally don't like. I have been thinking about maybe making it grid trade so that it takes advantage of the currency pair's fluctuation (like it does now, but in a more controlled way), with maybe, say, a 1 pip minimum gap. This would reduce the number of trades - and therefore hit the profitability - but would also cut down on the margin requirements. My new EA already contains a time filter, but I have it set to 24 hours because it trades so infrequently, and I've not seen many setups trigger in the dead zone.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Thank you, I just made the settings the same as in your screenshot except for hf mode. My account is too small for hf mode. Now waiting for trades.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thats great news. That way we can test it maybe from 8 am - 8 pm (london+ny) and 8 pm-8 am(ny+tokyo). Or any other combination. Also the grid could be usefull also. So many things to test...

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi paul thanks for the brilliant work so far on this neat little EA, I think the grid idea would be a very good addition and really work well to clean up some of the HF trades, the grid gap should also be adjustable so we can experiment and find the best size gap to use

--- 帖子 #228 ---
hi Paul, thx for your great work. i hope we gonna make a lot of money:-)

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I've just spotted a mistake in my code for rule #4 (the close and open ratios of candles 2 and 1), so will post an update to correct that shortly. Unfortunately, that means I'll have to go back and re-run a bunch of tests to see how much it has affected the signals. However, one thing I have been looking at to limit losses and to protect accounts from being blown up is to make sure that all trades are closed at the end of every day (say 11pm broker time). This would stop holding trades overnight (thus reducing swap fees) and would also protect accounts from gap as the weekends. From my paper trading of this, it seem we ought to be able to reduce the candle ratios to greatly increase signals, while keeping a tight rein on the risk. Thoughts anyone?

Great idea.

Has any one tried this on ONADA. They are using FiFo rules so multiple trades with the same TP and SL will not work there. Looking for a replacement EA becouse of those issue. Coder for the EA I was using was unable to fix the issue.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Paul, first of all thanks for all your effort on this and leading this thread. Being familiar with similar strategies, my $0.02c of suggestions: 1) Yep, good idea to close at eod 2) In such scalping systems, where the target is a small move and the risk is much larger, implementing a time-stop is very useful. So I would suggest that you exit a trade after a few bars, whether its in profit or loss. 3) Looking at the code, I see that once a position is opened, it only closes once a sl or tp is hit. I think if you have a buy or sell going and another buy OR sell is triggered, then the prior buys or sells should be closed. 4) Again, looking at the code, based on the stragey document - I don't think you need the TriggerCloseRatio input or the (r1&gt;=TriggerCloseRatio &amp;&amp; r2&gt;=TriggerCloseRati ) check for it in signal() 5) Another filter I would suggest : for the sell entries check if both the bars are green i.e. Close &gt; Open. Vice versa for buy entries. You'll find that this will decrease the risk

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I also use Oanda and live in the US. So FIFO and hedging are both huge restrictions for us. As long as the EA can use different lot sizes per open trades it should work fine. They can keep the same take profit and stop loss then, but of course the dollar amount of profit and loss will change do to varying lot sizes. If we could run one EA on one account for all sells and one EA on the other for all buys we can also get around the hedging restrictions. Could anyone program this into the EA? Looking forward to the responses, thanks guys.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
this EA seems like it has alot of potential here...just my two cents.....you should have user be able to modify the magic number for that it doesn't interfere with other EAs that are running at the same time. Thanks a bunch

--- 帖子 #238 ---
You could also close all trades at the market close on Friday. Either way, I'd encourage you to make these end-of-day (or end-of-week) closings optional. I'm in the process of doing some high time frame, high SL (H4, 200 pip SL) testing. In spite of the fact this is somewhat contrary to the core strategy, early results look promising. In my testing, no trade has hit the 200 pip SL. The only part of this I don't like is it sometimes takes days for a trade to hit TP. Fortunately, this is rare.

--- 帖子 #239 ---

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Just had a look at the pdf. I have done extensive research on multiple no-stop loss systems and they NEVER WORK. They could work for few weeks, months but in the long term, you are going to get few trades which will never come back in your favor. So just a few trades gone wrong are enough to wipe out all the profit as well as your initial investment. As a general rule of thumb, always backtest any system for few years to see how it performs.

What a legend. Thanks! Going to start testing this afternoon Whats the way forward on the high frequency mode?

It seems that every day we are closer to the holy grail, if possible, it is not obligatory, leave the Ea code open, to be able to make overcoming modifications, until 10 points do not work (the brokers and banks are united, and we must also be) This Ea is profitable but for large accounts, greater than 10,000 dollars, for the gross falls it can have. My wish is that it can be used from accounts of 100 dollars and up. Thank you for your effort.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
For normal mode you don't need 10k, only for HF mode.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
hello, PaulDV the last modification of the test slow down a lot. Is that right or is it just me? Can you limit operations as a number within each minute in mode HFT . For example, take 1 operation and take one operation every minute of an H1 candle if we give it as many as it can in the first 3 seconds. This would also allow small accounts to operate in mode HFT. thank you

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I think the spread filter may be to blame for the slow down. As for the HF mode, I'm going to completely rework this in my version of the EA. EDIT: I'll see if I can also retro-fit it into chenxee's EA.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thanks Paul for the openness in sharing your work... Kudos Brother...

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Thank you PaulDV &amp; Chenxee. The results for just 11/28 using previous version of EA running on two machines (my PC and an Amazon VPS) which use the same account (different Lot Size to tell them apart). EA settings below. Still have two open trades in draw down. Not bad results so far today - 20 trades, 18 to TP and 2 about to go into profit. Yesterday wasn't as pretty but still profitable.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Paul, Appreciate it if you can post the code for the EA please

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Done - sorry, uploaded the wrong file!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Interesting results! What size account are you using? Those are some pretty hefty lot sizes there! Also noticed that some aren't the full 5 pips but still seem to have hit TP - have you set different TPs for each currency, or was that you manipulating the TP on the fly?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Sorry, where is the newest version of Pauls ea? i find only the indicator??

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Great setup. I ran your setup on back test and it doesn't look that good... But as long as it work real time it's all that maters. How many pairs do you have loaded?

Click on the paperclip at the top of the page.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #267 ---
You can't see after just one trade of each pair if something is any good or not.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Account size doesn't really matter - scale your trade size down for smaller balances. The success rate is really what we want to see - 70%, 80%, 90%, or more profitable works for me. For Lot Size 6.5 TP = 3 pips, for Lot Size 5 TP = 4. 6.5 lots x 3 isn't quite as profitable as 5 lots x 4, but 6.5 x 3 is more likely to hit TP. I figure I won't go broke taking a profit.

For the HF mode I don’t see any reason why EA should open multiple trades with the same signal unless something is happening in your favour. For example, what’s the point in entering 3 x 1 lots on same order when you can just do a 3 lot order in one shot. I think if you’re gonna do HF life then there has to be a reason (ie better price entry as in price went up after bar open on a short sell or using a 3-step entry with A lot size, B lot size and finally C lot size on the same bar signal and allow EA to snipe better entries on same signal).

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks. It does it because it’s only a bug in the code, not an actual feature that was designed from the start. As I’ve already said, I’m going to remove it and code in something similar but has a specific logic to it. In the meantime, simply ignore the option if you don’t like how it works.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
First, a big Thank You chenxee for sharing the idea and to PaulDV for sharing the EA. Hi TTB, From the few days of forward testing, I agree that the EA in regular mode is better than HF mode. The "salami slicer" doesn't give any advantage as it is currently implemented. But, forward testing with different combinations of settings shows how robust and flexible this EA gem is. My 2 cents, a trailing stop would be the next leap forward. Cut the loses and let the profits run. Looking forward to PaulDV's next version.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi thanks for system looks to me valid trade.

EURUSD4H Buy trade

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hello everyone, I am new to this thread and reading it seemed very interesting. I was testing the strategy for a week manually and also the EA. With respect to manual operation, I calculate take profit automatically using the ATR indicator in 14 periods. This gives me the flexibility to become independent of the calculation of pips for the TP in the different currency pairs, whose volatility is different. I mean, the same amount of TP pips does not apply for GBPUSD, for example, as for EURUSD, in a given time frame. Testing the EA, it gave me excellent results in the NO high frequency mode, with all the pairs of coins I tried. It really is excellent. In my humble opinion, I think that adding the possibility of handling the TP and SL with the ATR indicator would give the robot a very interesting versatility. I leave a cordial greeting and congratulate you for the excellent work you are doing!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
what about using it with a filter like opening only at oversold and overbought areas of a stochastic for example? just to add some weight for the rejection. Regards

--- 帖子 #286 ---
With all due respect, in this strategy it is not necessary to use indicators that define an entry. It is given by the pattern of candles formed.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello. I have added, several things, trailing stop, sl, and tp, based on ATR, or not, stop those modified by broker spread increase, stop loss modified with open orders during the news. If you find errors, expose them. Let's see if we correct it together. The different parameters need to be optimized.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thank you very much!!! I'm going to test it !!! I can think of two functionalities that would add a lot of value: 1) Automatic calculation of the lot size: It can be based on a percentage of expected balance or equity gain based on the size of the defined TP. Another possibility is to base it on a percentage of the risk taken with the SL. 2) Make the multi currency EA. Excellent work!!!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
My 2 cents i dnt think EA could be a good choice for this strategy because u cant stop EA to produce false signal and if one wrong signal triggered it will cost u lot. The trades which u opened manually u are more concerned and responsible to monitor and look around and hence in case of wrong trade, u have some protective technique of cut loss which depend on ur mental strength, EA will never cutloss and drag u in deep water.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Is the real tp= standard tp - spread?????

--- 帖子 #291 ---
To who added to the tp the correction for the spread of the broker. A tick-to-tick trial has been done, with variable real spread, 1/100 leverage. Initial account: 130 dollars. Result: Profitabile.

Here add add the modification of lots to operate depending on the account

Looking forward to test this on real account !

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Im on mobile for next week has anyone counted on average how many orders the EA opens in a day/week/month based on extensive high quality tick data backtests? And yes - automatic lot size based on risk and account size would be better imo. The biggest benefit of using fixed lot size is losses are kept to a minimum as your account grows I guess. But then so will your gains. Hey, another parameter wouldn’t hurt to use fixed lot size or based on risk %.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Great job. 4th setting seems like most stable setting on long term. Did you also use IC markets ? How come 4 and 5 have the same candle/wick setting (1.5 &amp; 1.0) but 4 produced much more trades than 5 in the same timespan?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Wow, more insane results. And here i thought this is just a simple pa setup, maybe author was right about fx market gonna collapse.

As always, thank you PaulDV. Results since 11/01/2019 using different, evolving versions of EA on a demo account.

@PaulDV: what settings are you using? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Dont worry none of these guys are actually gonna use this in live accounts. A year from now theyll still be backtesting LOOOOOOL,NASA doesdnt even test there rockets this much. Either you know how to trade or you dont, a robot will BURN you.

Do i sense a hint of jealousy? Never hurts to expand your horizon-when it is all said and done, it isn't like the conventional wisdom is leading to profitability.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi farmabiog, Thanks for sharing the EA. I added a version number to the file name to help keep track of which is the latest version. Don't know if you're getting the same thing, but my compiler gives 21 warnings on possible data loss, empty control statements and check OderModify. The EA may not be operating as expected. Please check. Thanks. EDIT: Are you using pips or points to calculate your SL, TP, etc.? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Well, I’m trading it live, but you carry on pouring all over your charts for hours and still losing money.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Same as this: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post12638216 Im using my own version of the EA with money management built into it.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I just want to give a BIG "Thank You" to you, PaulDV, for what you are sharing in this thread ...Haven't tried this EA yet, but will do it next week .

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Because 5. has HF trading enabled. Paul I have the same setting as you and yesterday it opened those trades that you can see. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Which pairs do you have the EA on? Do you have any opened trades because I still have a few opened from yesterday?

Thanks, but the real thanks should go to @Moolah for bringing this strategy our way, and for @checnxee for building the initial EA.

You see yourself slowing down with the extra filters. everything is just brilliant, let's not spoil it. Good luck

Hiya, Yeah, slight difference between our setups, I think. Here's the settings I'm using: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm running this on 7 pairs: AUDUSD, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPJPY, GBPUSD, USDCAD and USDJPY. I'm using a raw spread account (commission only) on IC Markets , with a leverage of 1:500. All of my trades closed by hitting TP before the end of the day.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hey Paul, is there a possibility to get your version with money management included? Beside that I want to say thank you for your great work!

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi. I discussed with Paul about a dashboard that I was working on for this system and he gave me his blessing to share with the thread. It's based on the GVC Dashboard Thread that most of you know about. I'm uploading the source so you can play with it... Attached File(s) Dashboard - Ultimate v101_Currency Grail Scalping System4TF_V3.mq4 99 KB | 868 downloads So yes, you can trade with it. You can only trade one time frame at a time (by setting one to True and others to False). The signals are based on the last version of scp_indi2. What's different besides the system functionality in the dash? The pips column can be set to any time frame and added six additional sessions for trading. Since the dash uses a lot of CPU I can suggest that you set Max bars in history and Max bars in chart to 1000 to make it run better. Your computer will also need at least 4 GB of RAM and anything over 8 GB is suggested. The last disclaimer: use only on demo. I've verified the signals but please feel free to make changes to the dash or to suggest any. Let me know if something is broke.

Last version of software have some big upgrades. SL (previous high/low) and trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Paul, Could you please share the latest version of the EA? Also, have you done away with the HF mode? Thanks

--- 帖子 #318 ---
This is an experiment with changing "Minimum ratio close/open bar" setting in the latest scp_ind. The Red and Blue arrows are "Minimum ratio close/open bar" = 0.0. The White arrows are "minimum ratio close/open bar" = 0.03. 0.0 gives more frequent trades and usually more profitable trades. My EAs are set to 0.0.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
The GBPJPY trade on the 13th November would have lost. This is why I went with 0.03. Yes, 0.00 will produce more trades, but it is also more likely to cause a loss or a large drawdown and maybe a margin call. This is why rule #4 is there: if you check the manual, the author states that it's better to miss a dubious trade that then goes on to win than to risk the loss...there will be more trades. I totally agree with this, and if you run this on multiple pairs, the profitability is good enough to miss quite a few trades - greed will kill your account eventually.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I'm still testing at the moment, and I still need to change a number of things like the information panel UI, but I'll post an interim version shortly. Yes, I'm doing away with the HF mode - it's simply far too dangerous, and the EA is profitable enough without it.

Thanks Paul...

Mind blowing how people are still trying to complicate this. Just run the ea as it is as per authors rules and backtest using high quality data sets and if you like what you see go live with it. the issue I see with these types of EAs and such low takeprofits is the spread that nobody considers. I understand spread is taken into consideration when you open an order the ea is accounting for it when it’s looking to hit the tp, but think about spread and how far the candle has to go in order for you to lock a profit. Most times the tp is 5 pips. And if your spread is 1-2 pips you should deduct that from your tp targets. In the authors manual some of his trades are marginally winning and if you saw the ask and bid line before opening that trade you’d probably see it wide as half the tp. I bet you if you reverse this ea like completely reverse the buy and sell signals you’d probably get the same results.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Switch to a better broker, most true ECN brokers has 0-0.10 pips spread on 5 major pairs. Seriously, you shouldn’t even daytrade/scalping FX with 1-2 pips spread, your broker eats all your account.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hello Paul In the printscreen of the settings i see that you added SL "previous high/low"....will the TP have Risk-Reward 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 options too? Thanks for all the work all of you developers putting in, great work

--- 帖子 #330 ---
But backtesting your setting is really bad. Not sure what to think of this backtesting anymore. I've tested several settings and they were bad but on live accounts it looks better.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
My broker is an ECN broker. What I’m saying is when you’re backtesting and you see amazing results it’s probably because you have no idea what the spread was at those past signals that your backtesting results are likely ignoring and just taking the trade. the only way to trade these types of EAs is VPS + ECN broker like you mentioned. VPS because you gotta get in right after 2nd candle close and it helps that it’s online 24/7 without interruption as well.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Are you even using high quality datasets? And what timeframe are you backtesting from ? Lastly, what broker are you using to backtest? all of these should match in order to get same results as him

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Agreed. This is why I am using a VPS with less than 1 ms latency to my broker’s server. On back testing, using MT5 is more accurate when testing with 100 percent history quality, modeling every tick based on real ticks, and emulating requotes and slippages. I hope Paul can create a MQL5 version of the EA even for BT/optimization purpose.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
The best settings I've found on EURUSD over a 3 year period are 2.9; 1.4 and 0.9 - but you only get 171 trades over those 3 years (so about one per week). Your settings appear to be producing decent results, and I think as long as we don't let the EA trade blindly and we keep an eye on the trades it does take, then we ought to be ok. I'm trading with these settings now, and keeping an eye on things.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Yes, options for TP are None; Fixed; Factor of SL. That said, you should stick to the strategy - there's a reason why the author set those values.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I agree. I do wish people would stop trying to improve on what is already a decent strategy. I won't be diverting from the core strategy myself as it seems solid to me.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Yeah, 1H, IC markets . Attached Image (click to enlarge) It's just strange thats all, I don't really care that much for back testing anymore. I've done plenty, my focus is on forward testing. But I had a last spin using Pauls settings. I will test mine default and Paul will test his also Northwind will test his and we will have a bigger picture.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Could you share the MM Version of EA? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
It is clear that this strategy works with a very low spread, in the order of less than 1 PIP. With which it begins to be profitable from time frames of 1H or more. If the spread is higher, it forces it to be executed in larger time frames, that is, think of 4H or more.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi farmabiog, Any progress on fixing the 21 warnings in your great EA version? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Sorry, I'll try to correct the mistakes. The version published by PaulDV is the correct one

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thank you. Very interested in using the trailing stop feature but not until we get a clean compile. EA could give nasty surprises from unexpected/unknown behavior. All the best.

Hi Ranger Have set up on the EA which started 10pm Sunday evening GMT and has positive trades per screenshot below. Are we taking EA trades and manually exiting? Also when the ticks move to crosses on trade, do you reset and how often? I have a corrupted dashboard, would anyone know why this is? Many thanks in advance Regards Degsie

--- 帖子 #358 ---
@Degsie...not my dashboard....but it looks like you have to change the font size on your Windows profile to something smaller than what you have presently.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thanks Ranger, will do ....

--- 帖子 #360 ---
not as rare as you think perhaps....

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I have only looked casually. I may invest some time into a further inquiry. I like the idea of getting a higher time frame signal, then using a lower TF for an entry. Say like a daily/1hr combo. Even more so interested in the signals that go against you some. At any rate, seems like this, may perhaps be another decent PA reading clue, which I have grown fond of lately.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hello, I have been folowing this thread, and I would like to test the EA, but I am a bit lost as to which version is under test right now... I've seen references to several versions of "scp", a "currency grail scalping with spread and news filter", and a "dashboard - ultimate...". What's PaulDV's latest version (that is under test right now)? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Anyone here please keep updating results , win or loss doesn’t matter . Green pips to all .

EA started trading at 1am, put it on 28 most meaningful pairs. I've got 37 wins and 10 open trades currently erasing all profit and making me a loss, real account. profit 5.46, open loss abt -8/9.00. Those troublesome trades went also 25pips in red I am using SCP with 1.5 and 0.9 TP at 3, should have set min ratio of close/open bar at 0.03 maybe. Will post statement EOD.

Are my messages visible to all? I'm not getting response to my posts. i need some help and guidance to set this EA. Can someone help pls?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Great work ranger_Ip. the system doesnt seem to take trades even when i select Autotrade to true. do you mind sharing your set up?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I shared the one hour setup above. Compare with the scp2 indicator to see if it's generating the same signals. You're not going to get 10 signals simultaneously. There will be periods even with the settings for ratios that Paul uses that no signals are generated that hour.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I haven’t texted it myself but Paul’s tests show 173 or so trades over 3 years. If that’s on H1 then imagine D1/W1. if you change the trigger parameters and relax then you’ll get more signals but also more fakes.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
thid isn’t the place to ask these questions really. If you don’t know how to load an indicator or an ea you really shouldn’t be trading. Plus it would help to read the thread first. How hard can it be to put an EA in your experts folder and restart your MT4 terminal software and run it? Any errors will be reported in the Journal logs tab at the bottom. And any errors you get you need to copy and paste those here so the authors can take a look and not make statements like “it doesn’t work help”. Not trying to be rude but yeah you gotta put in some effort to finding the solution before asking for help

--- 帖子 #371 ---
thanks Tiestobob. I have done above things you have stated. No errors and also no trades placed. So not sure what is the problem. I will post the setting again if someone wants to take look. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hello, I keep getting this in my Journal... Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #373 ---
One of two reasons: The connection to your broker was down and/or your broker has not supplied up to date price information to your terminal. Slippage has occurred and the price being requested for the order is out of date (can happen when there is lag on the connection).

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Yea, not sure on his settings. Personally, I'm eyeballing it. As with most PA, if you gotta squint, pass on it. That's my opinion.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks for this. I have recently changed my internet provider. This week I have lost connection several times. Tomorrow I am sending back the kit and going back to my other provider where I did not experience any issues. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!" Regards. Tom.

Hi ,this mean You TP is too short . some brokers not allow scalping fast wins... cheers

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I've been doing some forward testing and had a few trades that went way too long, and having analysed the figures, I came to the conclusion that the separation (i.e. trend) of the two bars needs to be taken into account. Basically, I noticed that where the gap between the lows or highs of the two candles was less than 0.5 pips, the trade had a tendency to go in the opposite direction. So, I've made a small tweak to the indicator to include this as a parameter, and I'm using the following values on both demo and live accounts: Attached Image I've added this into the EA as well. I'm currently forward testing on 14 pairs, and I've set up a trade explorer which is attached to my profile, as well as a myfxbook system ( http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Paul...-grail/3772277 ). You may notice that I've switched to just 4 pips as a TP because I've also noticed that a TP of 5 is often missed by just a few points. Any observations are welcome.

So where the second candle has little or no wick? Am I reading that right? Would have that saved that cable trade that you got tagged on?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Apologies, there was a typo from my cut and paste and I hadn't spotted that it hadn't compiled! I've updated the file with one that should now compile.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
No, I mean the offset between the two candles. E.g. if they are trending up, the low of the second candle must be higher than the first, but if this gap is too small then the trade is likely to fail or take a very long time to recover. But you're right about the losing cable trade: that was due to the parameter for rule #4 not being large enough (I think I had it as zero). With the current set of parameters, that losing cable trade would have been avoided, and a subsequent one would have been taken that day and it would have won.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
ok gotcha….I am finding something similar, if the second candle touches the open of the first, its more likely to be a problem...let me ask you one more thing, any data on candles in the same direction? have you looked at that at all?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I can't say that I've noticed that. I've had a quick run through a few of my charts looking at the signals, and I don't see a pattern regarding that myself - but maybe that's due to my settings overall?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
you know what, no scientific evidence here either....but that's a good idea, I will have a look at your trades thus far and check a few things out that I have been pondering....that way we can be on the same page, and saves me loads of time to boot...will get back atcha if I sees anything interesting.... thanks for your time, and effort....have a great weekend....

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Thanks - you too. I wouldn't recommend going through my trades, per se, as many of them were taking using other values for the trigger. I would suggest using the indicator and going back through the charts to examine what would have happened for each one.

Thanks Paul for uploading the EA and for your effort. What is the size you are trading with for a given trade? Are you using the spread filter and what is the maximum tolerance that you are allowing for a spread? Thank you once again

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I'm not using a spread filter. My position sizing is being done by my own EA using money management - 20% risk per trade with a +50 stop. This usually equates to a gain of around 1.5% per win. I will be posting a copy of my EA soon.

--- 帖子 #390 ---

Hi! I get 12 trades in a row that hit 5 pips TP but this last one is confusing. It looks like a Doji, its news time so why EA takes this trade? CAD JPY H1, default settings

--- 帖子 #396 ---
[Цитат = Toppi; 12651567] Здравейте! Получавам 12 сделки подред, които удрят 5 пипса TP, но тази последна е объркваща. Изглежда като Доджи, неговото време за новини, така че защо EA предприема тази търговия? CAD JPY H1, настройки по подразбиране {image} [/ quote] Hi. Quite normally, the robot compares the last two candles, and if it finds conditions for entry, it takes operation on the third when it opens. You see everything else afterwards.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I don't use a news filter because the author says that you shouldn't have to take fundamentals into account and the strategy is using pure price action. That said, I haven't tested the news filter that was added to the EA, so maybe there's something not right with the settings? If you had been using my new settings, this trade would not have been taken. Load the latest version of the indicator to your chart and you will see that there's no signal: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Paul, I also get a signal there with the new settings applied. In manual trading I basically ignore such small candles, but the EA would have taken it I think. Thanks Andreas

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi Andreas, That signal is not the one that Toppi took: he took a trade on the opening of the doji following the large drop. I would check your settings again, as I've downloaded the latest indicator again (in case I'd made another typo) and it doesn't show that signal unless you set the Min trend between bars to zero.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi Paul I had a closer look and at 0.5 Min Trend the signal still stays -and it disappears when I change the Min Trend settings to 0.6. Different data feed for my broker I think. Thank you very much for all your efforts, Paul! Huge respect for your knowledge and all the support given to us. Cheers Andreas

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Ah, yes, that's true - signals will vary from broker to broker. But if you set the Min trend to 0.5 you would have had an additional win!

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Dear PaulDV, first of all I would like to thanks your effort to create such a great strategy into an EA. IMHO, although the trade entry is quite accurate but with the large SL really make a serious concern on long term investment as we all know markets change from time to time. Have you consider to turn this into similarity strategy like a breakout scalping which came with a tight SL and able to trail the profit to breakeven or lock down some pips when price move into a profit zone? Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Good Results Degolep . I Checked the GU chart , But I can't see any signal by the indicator with your setting during that period of time? Have I missed some thing?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Well thats what ea opened, cant say anything else.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Thanks. Yes, I've been observing the behaviour of certain currency pairs and have plans to test out such a modification. I'm planning on building a tool that produces a CSV for a given pair and set of parameters to show the max journey the signals take. From this, using Excel, I can then examine the effects of using different SL values. For example, having done this manually for a number of pairs using the current settings, AUDJPY would work well with a SL of 0 - there would be losses, but the gains would be massive. E.g. using 20% risk, last 12 signals: 1 - 13.33% gain 2 - 26.67% gain 3 - 4.44% gain 4 - 16% gain 5 - 13.33% gain 6 - 20% loss 7 - 26.67% gain 8 - 20% loss 9 - 11.43% gain 10 - 8.89% gain 11 - 8% gain 12 - 8% gain This equates to a total gain of 126% in just 12 trades, including 2 full losses! If we take the risk down to a much more acceptable level of 5%, the overall gain becomes 26%, which is still very impressive.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Paul My honest take is; any one using the EA/concept has a big tolerance for risk i.e not using S/L- risking % of equity considered 'insane' by normal standards. i mean, as can be seen risking 20% is giving super impressive gains. in my opinion we can have an option where we keep the risky behavior intact. basically, why not swing for the fences- i get it- account can get blown-as i said this ea is not for the faint of heart. you keep sharing great work... Thanks

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Very good Paul. Can you share last version with this settings? Thanks

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Impressive work Paul!. IMHO the most important point with this strategy is money management. I think that it is crystal clear that at least it is a 94% - 95% profit system (depending on the pair with limited pips losses). Then to make as profitable as possible, the main issue is to use the correct lots to not blow up the account, and maybe if X hours have passed close the entry instead of touch the SL trying to avoid swap costs, with only 4 pips profit system per entry to implement trailing stops to keep profits I see it very complicated.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Whats is the best settings for this dashboard. There are so many settings.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I am cheking different configuration backtesting the EA. Unfortunately I don't have third party tick values, then I only get Modeling quality of 90%. Is there a significant difference in the results modeling at 90% vs 99% with this strategy / EA? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
In my experience, there is a big difference in results between 90% to 99%. You wouldn't think it would make a big difference, but it does.

New EA and Indicator As promised, here are the latest versions of my own EA and indicator. The EA contains some proprietary code that I am not allowed to share, so please don't ask for the source. The other EAs in this thread contain the exact same entry logic as my EA, and that should be all you need - mine simply contains some additional money management and trade management functions. Here are the parameters: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The parameters ought to be self-explanatory, but I will come back a bit later and update this post with a few more details.

Hi Paul what MM setting did you apply for these results

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hello everyone, maybe I missed something, but the indicator signals do not correspond to the initial status, the screen attached ...

--- 帖子 #418 ---
20%

--- 帖子 #419 ---
The signal looks correct to me - what do you mean by "initial status"?

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Thanks, with trailing stop settings i suppose?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
No, no trailing stop, just the values i mentioned in the post.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
should the first and second candles be bullish or am I mistaken?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
No, their colour is irrelevant; they simply have to be trending - that's why you should switch to bars instead of candles: to avoid confusion or bias due to the colour of the candles.

understood that it contains proprietary code and it's not up for sharing.. however, it has expiry date. would it be alright for you to remove it? Thanks for consideration.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Nice job gents. been going through this thread and very interesting EA. been testing it, however when i open multible charts and using the Tpl and Will activate the EA, it askes if i Will Close the previus EA. Do i only need to open one EA ? There is a smiley face on the secund chart with out opening the EA.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
The template includes the EA with the default parameters, so you don't need to add it manually to the chart.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Eventually, yes. I'm not finished with developing it yet, and will increment the expiry each time I post an update.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
OK so far... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I think it makes sense to remove GBP pairs. The TP is small and fixed. GBP easily takes out the Stop of 50 pips due to it's volatility. By using GBP, we are getting the bad part of volatility without any advantage of volatility[due to fixed T/P] Thanks

--- 帖子 #435 ---
If that's the case, then my suggestion would be to include filter for the EA to only enter trade below the "Max Spread" setting that we could set. Example: Max spread : 10 When spread is 12, then it will never enter trade, until it is 10 or below. --just my 2cents. as scalping, as you know, has tight TP. thus, spread is making quite a huge chunk of it.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
When i am backtesting the last version i get best results with 3 to 1,9 instead of 1,5 to 1,5. TP 4 is better than TP 5. Timeframe 1H. EURUSD But Paul propose 1.5 and i don t know why? any idea?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Received no trades in the last 24 hours with your new EA with default settings. I have 4 charts open with your template on each and smiley face on each on the 1H CHARTS. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #438 ---
There hasn't been any entries on those pairs.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Just the settings I'm using - use whatever you feel is best.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I got default settings, had these trades closed. EURCHF still opened and -20 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) PaulDV you have set it to 5% risk?

I know I will just leave it like this.

No, I'm using 20%

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi Would be nice if you would give the source of EA as mq4 too. Sometimes making things like this open source can be fruitful and people can look into source and add or fix some issues and features and some people like me can learn from it. Thanks ps. Also, would be nice if someone has a good setting for 15 minute charts sharing it. pss. one feature that would be nice to have is limiting the bot to take new positions based on free margin, user can set if the free margin is below certain amount or a percentage of balance... no new positions until the previous ones are closed.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Yes, wouldn't it be nice if someone spoon fed us all with everything we wanted so that we don't actually have to do any of the work? Read my post again - you'll see why I am unable to share the source. If you want the source, go back to the previous version on this thread - that contains everything you need for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Account gonna explode soon.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yes, but you can't trade 20% risk with many pairs. maybe 1-2%

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I know but still the draw down is big, I've loaded it with 5mil monopoly money, wan't to see how it will go

--- 帖子 #449 ---
How have you managed to get so many open trades? The parameters you've shown say a max of 4 trades, with a max of 2 on any one pair...

--- 帖子 #450 ---
This strategy has great results if it is optimized.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I don't know, you tell me. I'm using the default settings. The only thing I have changed is the magic number for each pair.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
That's why.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Well anyway, I think this way we saw how good or bad is the setup. I got more or less all the alerts, no ignoring any signals.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Does the Magic number change the Way it trades ? If so what Will happen when Not changing Magic number with multi pairs..

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Yes, there are two Max Trade parameters; one restricts how many trades can be open on the current pair, the other restricts how many trades can be open across all pairs, but for this to work, all pairs must use the same magic number.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Yeah, my account blew up this afternoon - combination of trading during the UK election and all of the USD news today for the most part, but I've also spotted a possible link between some trades which lost, namely entering a reversal trade in a strong trend, with the trend overpowering the trade. I've amended the indicator to take this into account, and none of the losing trades would have been taken, had it been included at the time. I've also added a spread filter as requested by others, and also incorporated a gap filter to avoid entering trades where the trigger candle gapped from the previous one.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
So Paul, defining a trend and taking this trade setup in the trend direction? What criteria did you use to define a trend? Thanks

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I noticed that if 3 out of the previous 4 candles were in the opposite direction (i.e. trending), then the trend is likely to be too strong for a reversal to occur. So, the code (you can see it in the indicator) checks the 4 candles prior to the trigger candle, and if 3 or more are all in the same direction, it ignores the signal.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Take a look to this MT5 platform. The spread is very low. www.crowdforex.ch

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Thank you Paul for the explanation...

--- 帖子 #461 ---
great will load the news EA version. I closed all other EA's.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Dear Paul, Thank you for the hard work. I am sure every member watching this thread in the community appreciates it. Paul, after testing out this strategy I think if we can filter our some entries we can be very profitable. If you do get time, please do see about adding an RSI filter because I was analyzing the results and I felt RSI can be very good at filtering out bad trades.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Paul, this is quite a deviation from the original strategy, although it's for the better. You had just filtered out "Three white soldiers" pattern. I've tested the 1.2 version which has higher overall % of winning. However, it's trade count are much lesser than 1.1. 1.1 takes more count of trades, many of those are successful, are now being filtered out due to this feature. I suppose for the next version 1.3, the update in 1.2 should be a choice whether to be enabled/disabled. but, please default it to "enable" at first. This will help in performing side by side testing between 1.1 and 1.2 with a flick of switch. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Thanks, yes, it IS a deviation from the strategy, but it was becoming clear that, apart from EURUSD, the strategy does have a tendency to eventually lose, taking a large chunk of the account with it. I have tried back tests without a stop loss, which recovers most of those losses incurred when using a stop loss, however there are two issues with this, namely that the drawdowns can get quite big if caught in an opposite trending market, and that on occasions the drawdown is so big that you end up with a margin call. The only solution to this is to use infinitesimally small lot sizes, but then you don't get a decent return. I think the clue to all of this is to be found in the strategy manual, where the author states that you should withdraw profits on an ongoing basis. The only times I have seen this proposed is with strategies that can kill the account, and unfortunately I think that this is one of those. I am satisfied that EURUSD is a good pair to use for this, and that it can be used without loss, but the other pairs are something else entirely, and I haven't found a set of parameters that work long-term. Version 1.3 does, indeed, have the gap and trend avoidance set as parameters (I needed it to maximise the return on EURUSD), and I'll post it up shortly (EDIT: attached below). I've also added an optional RSI filter as per tony.stakr's suggestion, and having gone over previous long-running trades, would have excluded those trades and some very large drawdowns.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Dear Paul, Thank you so much for that. I would get the testing started as soon as the market opens on Monday. Thank you again for the hard work paul Regards Tony

--- 帖子 #466 ---
First of all, thanks Paul for all your hard work and ideas. This is an interesting (and quite simple) concept. I trade primarily asian hours on 12 pairs, which is going reasonably well, but are looking for something to "spice" up trading during european hours in particular. I personally think the most important thing in the current EA is the time filter (and news filter for that matter). Systems like this certainly work better in more calm markets, and some of the drawdown can be avoided by doing so. Trading this after US close but before Asian open is like russian rulette with 4 bullets in the chamber, as is trading on news events. I noticed some talking about a 1 pip TP etc - one thing to keep in mind is that if if you enter long on the open on any H1 bar, the statistical chance of that bars high is 1 pip higher than the open is very high. I also noticed on some of the backtesting I did it was quite sensitive to the TP, on many optimisation runs 5 pip was the optimal one, while 6 pips have a loss... That is a bit worrying but again I think the key lies in the time filter. I completely understand you can not release the code, but it is the money management part that is proprietary? If so could you release the code without it? Lastly, has anyone tried to convert this to MT5? Would make it much easier to test and more backtest statistics.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Are the templates your new recommended settings for EU and all other pairs, just querying as you have the filters set to off for EURUSD, im assuming these are genuinely not required for this pair, but required for all other pairs right? Thanks

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Thanks paul for update based on community's feedback. I've backtested the indicator &amp; EA. The indicator works as intended. However, the EA seems to have a "high frequency" bug, i guess? it's opening trades almost every hour, and not based on the indicator... maybe you can have a look at it again? i'll remain to use 1.1 for forward testing (EU), and 1.2 for backtesting other pairs. the RSI idea was actually a great idea! cant wait for it to work properly for testing! hopefully this EA will be great for majority pairs later on once things being fine-tuned! soon, it'll be matter of finding the right setting for each pair (as each pair has different spread, swings differently, etc)

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Sorry about that - please revert to 1.2 for the time being or hold off using 1.3 until I get a chance to fix it (not tonight unfortunately).

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Just wanted to ask if this pattern has emerged on USDCAD, daily chart. im considering to try this trade out. would appreciate community thoughts on the same.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Correct - filters are off for EURUSD as it hardly ever loses with these settings.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Fixed Version 1.3

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Paul, This is brilliant. Amazing EA. The back-test was perfect. This is the back-test since Jan 2018: Nice work. I'm going to test a few other pairs and see if we can get similar results.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Yeah, on EURUSD the results are great - it doesn't trade often, but when it does, it seldom loses. I've got just EURUSD running on my live account until I can find settings for other pairs, but even if I don't find anything else that works, EURUSD on it's own should yield a small fortune given time.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hi Paul. Version 1.3 is an independent program, or do you need some kind of indicator? ------ Paul, launched as is, connected trading statistics, but something it does not display the transaction. What am I doing wrong? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi what is the time frame used in the mentioned results?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hiya Feex! Yes, it's independent and doesn't require any other indicators. The trade stats show only those trades submitted by this EA, and will ignore any trades submitted by something else - this way, the stats show the performance of this EA on this currency pair. Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
That would be H1.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I have been playing around with a lot of pairs. It would have been much more easy in MT5 if it was programmed as a portfolio function. But nevertheless I am intrigued why the EURUSD results are so different that pretty much every pair. USDJPY for example suddenly goes into "drawdown mode". This is why I asked the post earlier about maybe taking away the prop part of the code to play with it more. As I mentioned I think time filter has a lot to do with this (in practical trading at least) and most likely news filter. In addition it would be great to get some more trades if the risk/drawdown ratio is not changed to the negative. I am not sure yet what to suggest, but I am working on it. All filters reduce the amount of trades, so ideally one would want more trades, and then start to filter.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Sorry fachim, I think I missed your earlier post. To be honest, the 'magic' is in the settings which are all available in the source for earlier versions, so you ought to be able to play with the latest one of those to find better settings. Take a look at the one here: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post12651037 Don't forget that there are other timeframes too that the author has documented...I've simply been concentrating on H1...and there may be better timeframes for other pairs.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Ah, sorry, I misunderstood. Looks like that could be a bug - I'll look into it.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Paul, it's ok)) I'm sure you will find the reason)

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Thanks Paul. I have played around with other time frames - USDCAD 5 Min is not too shabby for example. But the performance is hampered by the odd trade that gets into drawndown for a long time - usually to the end of the test. Its much easier to analyze trading statistics in MT5 but anyway - a few suggestions that could maybe improve it: Stop and reverse: If long position(s) are open and a sell signal occurs - close longs and reverse to short. If you think trading logic it makes sense, if the model wants to go short there should not be any reason to keep a long position and visa versa Close on Friday: Will take down swap cost and quite frankly over weekend positions increases risk dramatically. Can maybe be combined with no new trades after say lunch EST Friday. Channel filter: Calculate for example some sort of envelope (BB or some other band) on a higher timeframe. Only take sell signals for example if in the higher timeframe price is in the top quartile for example of the envelope/channel, or above 50% or some sort of other variation. Any views?

This is happening since beginning

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Yes it's "legit". Yes, we've tested it (please read the thread!) Please explain what you think is wrong. Yes - see my Trade Explorer. Yes, it works on a real account. Please read the thread before you ask any more questions.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Okay, now i read the thread. everything seems fine to me. i tried backtesting it and it goes fine until it doesnt.. RR is very poor here i guess. i had almost 95% succes rate, but those 5% went really bad and took all my winings. In my opinion i would make a time stoploss... if tp doesnt hit in 1 day i will stop my trade, max 5% risk on account.. that means you have hard stop on 5%. Did you include that second wich has to be higher than the previous wick? to make a trend like he says in his book. One more thing, he said you need to visualy see this setup, don't think EA can help you there, neither do indicators because you need a trained eye to see those setups. I noticed your indicators puts entries where Open candle and Close candle price are together, that doesn't look like valid setup. Maybe if the candle close is above previous candle close you can say its not valid setup(this is for Buy)? because i'ver seen alot of examples about that and they fail alot

--- 帖子 #501 ---
EURUSD on the default settings gives a 100% win rate in my testing. All of the rules given by the author have been implemented. As per any indicator or EA, there is no "visual check" that can be done, so this point is rather moot here. That said, there's nothing stopping anyone from trading this strategy manually. I'm not sure I understand what you mean about the Open and Close prices - could you give some examples of what you mean perhaps?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
i've checked your indicator on 1.5/1.5/00.7 settings and gives alot of signals, those signals were 86% over 3 months, with 2% risk on stoploss(stop loss was on the begging of arrow), you could make 14.26% gain over 3 months, on one pair! it would be really profitable. PS.. i wasn't being extremenly accurate While EA i put same settings and did not get any trade, i've double checked everything.. might be some bug? Other wise, don't trade GBP pairs - too volatile, i would suggest trading EUR, AUD, NZD, JPY, USD (without EURNZD and EURAUD, because of volatility) about Open and close price... just forget it, i read the manual again and found simular setups and they were okay.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Default EA settings or your euro template settings?

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Could you please have a look on my issue. Snapshot attached in comment 498 where it is showing message

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Yeah those settings aren't exactly recommended to be honest. I'm using them for the short term on demo while I analyse the results, and I'm currently only using EURUSD on my live account using the EA default settings (not the ones you've been trying) - load the EA and click "Reset" on the parameters tab. It doesn't trade often - about once every two weeks - but when it does, it nearly always wins.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
They ought to be the same, but if not, then use the default EA settings on EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I have, and I'm not sure what the issue is, however the market IS currently closed, so I'm going to have to wait until it is open again before I can debug the code for that. All that said, the text is for information only, and won't affect the running of the EA, but I'll try and get it fixed if I can.

Hi Paul, what is the meaning of minimum trend between bars option? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi guys any views?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hi Paul, expiry date of 1.1 is very close and for EU, i'm suggesting ver1.1 to go live as it is the purest form of the EA without any additional features. thus removal of expiry date for 1.1 is much appreciated. the fixed 1.3 is still having some bugs of not opening properly according to the indicator. (the previous fix reduced a lot of issues! thanks for that!) backtested with the following indicator setting Attached Image and with the following EA setting Attached Image (click to enlarge) the EA is opening 2 trades on 4th-Nov-2019 0800 and 1100, which are not in the indicator/chart. Chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) EA open trade: Attached Image thanks

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi Paul and all. Congrats on your coding skills and your patience. Nice work Sir, I read the PDF from post 1 and then went through all the posts and I just am wondering if I/We may have interpreted the PDF wrongly. Stop laughing please..... Let me explain. Please refer to below taken from the PDF.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) In this example he has shown, he specifically says that the "2 bars must be trending upwards". This example shows the first candle with a bearish close.....not a bullish close as you would expect to see if you were talking about an upward trend. The reason I have pointed this out, is that in ALL the other examples on his PDF of both buy and sell trades, BOTH candles have either closed bullish or bearish......again, suggesting either a bullish or bearish trend is required in those two candles. (please refer to the PDF) So what I am suggesting is that either it is an error in my interpretation of the entry requirements(quite possibly )......or maybe an error was made in putting the PDF together. It does seem a bit odd that in all but one example.....the initial requirement appears to be for BOTH candles to close in the same direction to validate the setup. Anyway, let me know if that's not clear and I will have another go. Thanks in advance Paul, Michael

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I've identified the difference between the indicator and the EA and have now fixed it. I will post n update shortly.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
My interpretation of the PDF was that the candle directions were immaterial and we are only looking at the trend of the highs and lows of the two candles in order to identify an upward or downward trend. My analysis from past losses was that if both candles are bullish or both are bearish (in the direction of the highs/lows trend), there is a tendency for the trend to be too strong for a reversal and the trade frequently fails - this is one of the reasons I added the additional trend filter.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
This is a minimum distance in pips between the lows or highs of the two candles in order to confirm the trend. If the distance is too small, the subsequent trade has a tendency to lose.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I wish you well with this guys but for me this has all the hallmarks of a "fake" con. If you trade this I predict you will eventually lose big style I hope you all prove me wrong

--- 帖子 #516 ---
And why is that? Which hallmarks?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
New Version of EA and indicator - 1.4 The difference between the EA and the indicator has been fixed. The previous parameter of "Minimum ratio of close/open to bar" has been split into two parameters - one for the ratio of the close for bar 1 and the second for the ratio of the open on bar 2. This allows for the two values to differ - which is beneficial in the case of EURUSD. The following is a back test, over 3 years for EURUSD on H1 using the default parameters (with a 25% risk): Attached Image (click to enlarge) This equates to roughly 1 trade per week, with an average return of around 9% per month - which ought to be enough for most people, I think.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
No way, its a fake Happy new year !!!

Well I could be wrong I'm just wary of any system with the word Grail in it I've seen so many and it all turns sour in the end but with a second look this looks promising so I have set up a new profile and I will give the higher time frames a go on demo in the new year ....not long to wait all the best Time tool here https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=166925 Edit.. if I have got the setup right then AUDCAD seems to be a winner , see chart

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hi Paul. In version 1.4, trade statistics do not work either Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Yes, that would have been a winning trade.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Sorry Feex - I forgot to look at that issue...I'll look into it next.

Version 1.4 does not work or that it works less than version 1.3 thank. raypiaso.

AUDJPY H1 this morning, lh,ll, second bar larger , low to close larger , hope I'm getting this right. Failed

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Two winners gbpcad / eurusd. Next up NU/AU ?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
You got it right - that should have won...where did you place your stop? Also, one thing to note is that these trades can sometimes take up to several days to close in profit, so just because they don't close in one or two candles, that doesn't mean that they failed.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I think I have read NU/AU wrong so just ignore

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Just demo no stop

--- 帖子 #530 ---
I thought profit was to be taken on the next bar?

--- 帖子 #531 ---
No, you set a hard TP and wait for it to close.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
With respect, version 1.4 no orders were issued in my account.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Is anyone getting a constant rotation of messages on there experts tab using 1.4?? I can also confirm no new trades have been placed using 1.4.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
The same happen to me, I don't understand why

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Those are some debugging messages I put in and forgot to remove. I'll post a quick fix version shortly. As for the lack of orders, there haven't been any so far...this time of year is usually rather quiet, so this is not unexpected.

Currency Grail EA V1.41 Fixes trade stats for back testing. Removed spurious debug messages from the log.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Please read the manual and this thread. Understand the strategy. Understand how the EA trades.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
But version 1.3 works fine In the same settings as version 1.4

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Are you saying that 1.3 has opened some trades that 1.4 hasn't?...i.e. you're running both side by side? Has the indicator thrown up signals that the EA hasn't acted on?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
1.3 version opened 4 trades today. 1.4 version didn't open any.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Are you sure ? see chart I am not being negative but unless someone can correct me I think this method is questionable to say the least. Using the method with another proven system might prove rewarding or using the very best signals as per PDF but I suspect it's a case of ..... "you can make more money selling it than trading it"

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Degolep, you're probably using the early (Dec 21) version of 1.3 that had a "high frequency" bug. PaulDV fixed the bug and released a revised version of 1.3 on Dec 23. The early version was opening trades on the hour, without necessarily following the Currency Grail strategy. That being said, I still didn't have any losses with the early "high frequency bug" version of 1.3 !!!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I've got the indicators for 1.3 and 1.4 running on one chart and they are showing the exact same signals. Can you show me the settings you've used for each EA, and the trades they 1.3 opened please?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
You didn't follow the strategy: Rule #1: Bar 2 must be significantly larger than bar 1. Bar 2 is not significantly bigger than bar 1 in this instance - so that was not a valid setup.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I got no sgnals today on 1.4 default settings. Running on 5 major pairs

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Define significantly Hope your not waffeling Paul My confidence is low with this system I'm moving to 4 hour time frame On the plus side I found a great little indi to change all time frames on one profile with one click You need to load into your script folder

All default. Drag drop.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Use it or don't - your call - but don't blame the strategy if you don't follow the rules of the strategy. If you can't follow the rules on H1, what makes you think you'll do better on H4?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Sorry my friend, but I've put both version 1.3 and 1.4 of the indicator on those pairs, and neither of them show signals. As pantera1 mentioned, perhaps you're using the wrong version of 1.3 - the one that had the bug in it that opened trades when it shouldn't have?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
To all those who are bemoaning the fact that they haven't received any signals today (January 2nd)! Please read my post containing version 1.4...carefully! Seeing as I have to spell it out for you: The default settings of the EA are for EURUSD ONLY!! The default settings turn the EA into a sniper, and you will get an average of roughly ONE TRADE PER WEEK! If you're expecting dozens of signals per day, you're a greedy idiot. If you use the default settings on any other pair, you do so at your own risk. I suggest that you add the indicator to your chart - AND AMEND THE SETTINGS TO BE THE SAME AS THOSE YOU HAVE USED FOR THE EA. If you have done this, and the indicator doesn't show a signal and the EA hasn't opened an order, everything is working as expected. TODAY is the first trading day of the year...liquidity is VERY low at this time of year, and probably will be for the next couple of weeks - if you don't know this, you probably shouldn't be trading! If you don't understand the strategy properly, please read the PDF in the first post. If you DO understand the strategy properly, then you shouldn't need to ask questions about it. Please spend some time optimising the settings for other pairs and share your successes - I'm getting tired of people asking me to spoon-feed them!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Here's a 7 year back test of version 1.4. Pretty amazing by anyone's standards if you ask me. Thanks again, Paul.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Drawdown is 73.5%..Good Luck trading after you feel the pain of it in your account.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
It's the same version I've used over a week, and you didn't say anything when I posted positive results in the previous week. And now you are making excuses that it's only optimized for EURUSD. I know it's work for free that you make but we are testing it also for you, and I've been here form the start testing all versions of the EA. 1.4 version doesn't open same trades as 1.3 period. Which one is wrong I dont care. It's only demo account.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Firstly, I'd like to say that my rant wasn't aimed at you. It was specifically aimed at those people who drop into the thread, slap the EA on a number of charts and then complain the next day when they haven't had any trades...on the first trading day of the month!...idiots! Secondly, I'm not making excuses - I mentioned in post #464 (and a number of subsequent posts) that EURUSD is the only pair that I'm happy with. You even confirmed your knowledge of this in post #493. I wanted to highlight that if you're running it on other pairs (as am I for testing purposes) then you should expect the account to be trashed eventually. The fact that you're getting good results in the meantime is no surprise to me, just that I know that it won't last for long. Thirdly, I am grateful for people testing the EA and reporting issues, and I have no issue with anyone doing so. Again, my rant was about those who drop in expecting a free lunch and then complain that there isn't enough cheese! Lastly, yes, 1.4 opens fewer trades than 1.3. This was a direct result of post #510/#512, and brings the EA into line with the indicator. This is also the reason I added the parameter "Minimum ratio of open to bar 2" - if you set this to zero, it should revert to opening trades more frequently, but quite possibly to the detriment of the account. As a tip for anyone testing - I always use the indicator on a chart with the same settings as the EA. That way I have a visual check that things are working properly. If I get a trade without a signal or a signal without a trade then I know that something is amiss.

USDJPY H4 similar set up on EURJPY / AUDJPY H4 Strange they all appear on JPY

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hey Paul just wanted to say thanks on all your hard work here, unfortunately you cannot account for all the bottom feeders that want everything on a plate and also the negative bunch who shout things down, if you've got nothing constructive to say then go to another forum!!

--- 帖子 #557 ---
That's not strange at all - that's how the markets work. Your chart looks odd - are you on a spreadbetting account by any chance? This is what your H4 chart should look like from a proper broker: Attached Image

--- 帖子 #558 ---
So can you please expand on how the markets work, are you bullish JPY? Yes I see what you are saying regarding my charts. My MT5 charts agree with your charts (see attached) so who is right ?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
If you're asking about how the markets work, I would seriously suggest that you stop trading until you have had time to learn the fundamentals of trading - it's far too in-depth for someone to cover in a single post. But as a starter, you should look up "correlation". Your second screenshot is how it should be. I would recommend that you don't trade live with the broker/account you used for the first screenshot, as you will lose ALL of your money very quickly.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Paul thats true about brokers. I have been gatting mixed signals. Both using ECN account. One is coinexx other is ICmarkets. They dont show the same candle close price. But thats not our problem right now. Is it possible to add SL option, so it puts right SL on the neck of the arrow? Because if you want to test out other timeframes is uses high/low of 1h chart. Just testing out 4h timeframe with 1:1 RR to see how it goes. Im putting stoploss on the neck of the arrow, seems really good. But it would be much easier if i had EA to do it. Current backtest performance is running 30% per month with all pairs.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I assume you're referring to the arrow that the indicator puts on the chart, yes? If so, then where this is placed is governed by the "Additional room for SL (pips)" parameter, and is the high or low of the previous bar plus or minus this number of pips. It is not coded to use the H1 period - it uses the current chart period. The "SL Method" parameter of the EA has a setting "Previous high/low" which performs the same logic, however, you set the "Additional room for SL" in the "Stop loss (pips)" parameter. E.g. to place the SL in the same place as the arrow on the indicator, you set "SL Method" to "Previous high/low" and set "Stop loss (pips)" to 1. This will get you what you want.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
No I'm not asking you how the markets work nor do I need your advice but thanks anyway. My comment was regarding USD/JPY, AUDJPY and EURJPY all giving the same Grail signal on the very same bar and at the same time however your charts would not have shown this. My own systen also suggests a possible bullish phase on these markets which is why I asked your opinion on JPY.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Go back and read your comment - that's exactly what you asked. I don't see how I could have interpreted it in any other way.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
@PaulDV which timeframe you recommend with your EA?

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Have made MT5 EA version.. but implemented that EA works with bars open prices only so in Strategy Tester can be used "Open prices" modeling. Optimized GBPUSD with 20 years of data and found that the best time frame is Weekly. Only 85 deals in 20 years... on average 4 deals per year. But if found some 10 other symbols and some indexes/metals maybe this all package could work. It is possible to setup about 15 EAs on 1 account because of so few deals. See the backtest Excel attached. Implemented is_reverse_logic parameter in order to check maybe better works opposite logic - when selling setup then do buy and vice versa. For USDPY this worked out - see backtest Excel. But again very few deals - 45 in 20 years.. but profitable MT4 cant be used for optimizations/backtesting with SL/TP less than 10 pips. "Every tick" is very inaccurate. I recommend backtesting your MT4 EA on timeframes starting from D1 or remake it to use "Open prices" approach. The best thing when developing EAs for "Open prices" modeling is that optimizations and backtests work very fast. And you have precise data for a long history.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi, I might have two suggestions for improvement: As I understood the EA has a setting for the maximum number of trades both per pair and overall. The idea is that as soon as a trade has locked in profit (either by stop-loss or trailing stop-loss) this trade does not need to be counted anymore. This could give the EA some room to open a new trade earlier (just not on the same pair as the open profitable order). . When a trade nears stop-loss, you could decide to add a same trade to the position. This method is used in the "trading made simple" strategy and works great. In that thread they call it MEME (Multiple Entry / Multiple Exit). The idea is that with multiple orders of the same direction and same size you can average the entry price and indeed also the take profit level. This usually turns a loosing trade into a winner. Example of a MEME trade (not related to this strategy): Attached Image The EA expected a price drop, but instead price went up. By adding 2 extra trades the average became more favourable and eventually made a small amount of money. The first suggestion is risc-free. The second is not 100% risc-free. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Keeping in mind my post on the JPY pairs / Grail signals and the fact we are discussing a scalping method here I found your post “ that's how the markets work” a bit vague so I asked you to expand on it, that's all.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Might just be me but it gripes my beans when people chip in criticising every move without really giving anything back to assist at all, the way I see it is we are all here to try and build something and all have a purpose to build our accounts let’s make 2020 about contribution with definition.

Welcome. I am new to the forum. sorry for my bad English. I've been reading this thread for a long time. I want to thank you @PaulDV. You put in a lot of work and people complain here.

Check the settings on the indicator - they have to match the EA if you're expecting the signals to line up with each other.

I haven’t had a EU trade all week on default settings. Just confirming this is correct?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Get a better broker.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
That's correct - early January - things are fairly quiet. The default settings should result in an AVERAGE of 1 trade per week (on EURUSD), so some weeks you won't get any and others you might get 2 or 3.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Yes, but I'll be posting a new version before then.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Sorry for the late reply,there are a number of indicators which give you time remaining and spread,I use one that was on the Trading made simpler thread.trade the majors and more important minors in the London session and the spread is tighter.Also avoid NFP,Interest rate decisions and National holidays with regards to spread even though the PDF says to ignore news.I only shoot for 5 pips on the 1Hr,spread is just a cost of doing business,for example shooting for $100 and only getting $80 is not that bad is it?.Also google 25 trading Rules by Douglas Zalesky,he describes trading as laying 1 brick at a time,which this method basically is.stay disciplined and good pips to all

--- 帖子 #588 ---
morning all, just to clarify the avoid gaps and trend are we turning that on for EURUSD, just getting indicator settings the same as EA.

good day all i noticed on the EA by default it had maximum trades set to 0 and pair set to 0 could that be why no trades have been taken, just having a cursary look through my charts before markets open and noticed that, sorry if that was a stupid thing to mention just wondered.

Mine doesn’t seem to be trailing properly it locks in at 5 pips but doesn’t trail? I am using default settings. Thanks Jeff

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I moved the stop manually from +5 pips to +10 pips. My demo trade hit +5 pips and stopped out, but my live trade missed the initial stop and continued, so I moved the stop when it was sufficiently in profit. My demo trade opened at 15:00 at 1.11643 and stopped out 31 minutes later. My live trade opened at 15:00 at 1.11652 (nearly 1 pip higher) and hit my stop at 16:11. If I'd left my stop alone, it would still be running, albeit very close to my stop right now.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Ok thanks. I let it move stop to 5 pips and closed manually at 11 pips. Cheers Jeff

--- 帖子 #619 ---
sweet first one in the bag, after being a complete duche and not checking the indi and the EA settings were the same at least its all correct now.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
The default trail is "previous high/low", so after locking in +5 pips, the stop will be trailed every hour if the previous 2nd candle (i.e. 2 candles back) formed a new high/low. Usually the trade stops out long before this happens, but if it makes it this far, then it ought to start locking in some really good profits.

Thank you

Seems no one else on here is using SB charts so I'll stop posting them so there is no confusion Here's a neat wee script that will change templates on all open charts, you need to label your templates 0,1,2,3 etc http://www.forexstreet.net/profiles/...ts-mt4-scripts Good luck with the ea

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Which broker are you using for spread-betting, and are you trading live with them?

Try This EA with 10% weekly profit and Max DD 20% all time.

From today I turned on your robot. can you explain what "invert entry logic" means?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Setting ? Tf ? Pairs ? thank you.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
It is not worth wasting time. Here is the subject about "grail system" and @mselvi sells his robot. Why does he take money if he has such good results. It is better to earn money than selling .. Someone is trying to "graal system" at another time interval? and other currencies?

--- 帖子 #629 ---
can you share the mt5 version pls

--- 帖子 #630 ---
@PaulDV version valid until the first of March. Are you planning to introduce a new version? or other ideas for further work? A few days ago I pasted the results. But the post was not accepted.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Attached EA works on MT5 demo account and strategy tester. Use Open Prices Modeling while optimizing and backtesting - EA is specially build to work on open prices only, so backtesting is very fast. Anyway, I would not rely only on 1 EA... Better to work with "synthetic assets" prepared by a bundle of EAs. See idea here

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Yeah, I've been a bit busy with other work and haven't had much time for trading recently. I'll be uploading a newer version soon. I will also be uploading a small change I made to the indicator, which changes the colour of the chart background if the current candle is setting up for a signal - helps spot and prepare for upcoming signals when you're trading manually (which I've been doing recently using this).

--- 帖子 #633 ---
you are genius Now the sound signal is good. But you can't always react quickly. EUR / USD results are the best. But soon I will present the results in gold. Now I narrowed SL to 5 pips ... Very good results for EUR / USD gold below. I used two of your robots. Earlier version and new.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hi. Could you also please share the entire results? Has it been back tested or these are the live account results

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Excellent results. It looks like you're going for a TP of 2 with an SL of 5 - is that right? If so, then it really does dial down the risk. What settings are you using for EURUSD? EDIT: those results don't look like they were entered using the EAs - the open times are all wrong. So, can you confirm - are these all manual trades?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Nice! What settings and what timeframe please?

--- 帖子 #637 ---

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Thank you for the clarification - M1 timeframe makes sense now. I'll do some back testing myself as well.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Thanks for the work on the EA Paul. Is there an issue where there are a few losses in a row at the start of a trading period and it takes a long time to recover? E.g. on a test from 2010 to present there were some early losses, and the balance didn't recover to the initial amount until 2018. I'm using the default settings but it's definitely possible that I don't know how to back test properly...

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Evening Paul, in terms of the current EA which is running really well with the expiry is that one going to be allowed to be extended or used rather then move to the next one?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
You're on the old version - try this one: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...9#post12684619 It expires end of Feb, but I'll post an extended version shortly.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
That is VERY interesting. Clearly EURUSD H4, but what settings are you using? And what indicator is that?

--- 帖子 #645 ---
I haven't actually made any changes, so I'll probably re-issue it with an extension. I've now had 2 profitable trades on EURUSD this month for a total of 15%. Could have been more but I wasn't watching the charts this evening so let the EA to trail the stop, which ended with the default +5 pips instead of a possible +15.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I got this trade on demo last night, i really like the SL on previous high/low that you have coded in this one. without taking this thread off course that would be an interesting addition to Ultron still trying to do some backtesting for other pairs, do you have any recommended pairs that this works well on?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Is it just me or are back tests over the medium and long term not looking as promising as over the last year or so?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Sorry, I meant what are you using to filter the signals? Have you made a change to the code for this?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
the strategy tester is not very accurate. Can show direction. Not the exact purpose. I'm testing on a demo account. Tests are ongoing. Recently I changed settings. are not very good. After a month I will be able to write Which settings are the best. Works best on eur / usd. Gold has large correction movements. I need special settings and long tests. I will publish the results here.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Paul, do you know why a robot can't open a position on DAX? I've been changing settings for several days. It doesn't do anything. Week out of position. The settings are such that the indicator gives a signal.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
If the indicator gives a signal but the EA doesn't open a trade it can be due to a number of things: The EA has different settings to the indicator. The broker has disabled EAs for the symbol. There's not enough money in the account for the required margin. Can you take a look at the journal tab and see if there are any messages there or under Experts? If there are, they should give us some clue as to why it's not opening a trade.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
1. The indicator is positioned well. Signals on gold and eur / usd agree. 2. another robot for dax opens deals. same platform. same account. 3. Demo account has a lot of money. the journal tab says nothing. I will try on another platform (at another broker)

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Spread? I just took a look at the DAX and the spread on my broker is 100 points - do you have the spread filter on?

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Filter off. I did for checking; TP; 500 and SL 500 I tried to enable the filter. and turn it off. Reset the platform. Open a new dax window. I will check with another broker. (I have 3 with whom I check the settings all the time). I will set it to high sensitivity in a moment. we'll see if it opens. edit; The transaction has been opened. So it's the broker's fault. I am surprised that another robot works. In that case, I'm starting tests on the new platform. Thank you for your response

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hmmm..and interesting idea indeed. However, I've not been trading Ultron live as it still seems far too risky for me. If I get time, I may revisit it and seen what difference it may make.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Hi Paul! Could you help me to understand the parameters of the indi? I'm struggling to adjust them. I would like to know how to avoid this entries with no wicks. I have default parameters

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I've added a trend filter and it looks pretty amazing! Here's EURUSD - 18 winning trades! Not one of these would have failed. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Nice! Is it MA and ATR?

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi Paul, After reading this thread, regardless of any future results, I just want to thank you for all your work and efforts. Earlier on in the thread, someone suggested you were lazy for trying to implement such a simple system. However, given your efforts with the EA, hours testing and generosity, this is not laziness but rather a way to work more efficiently and keep one's mind open to any possibility. (with due diligence) Thanks again for your efforts and generosity!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Yes Paul, trending will make this strategy failed

--- 帖子 #665 ---
That's very exciting! Thanks, for the hard work, Paul. Did you add the trend filter manually or is it a setting in the EA?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
It's TCCI. I'll post the indicator for it at the same time.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hey Chad! It'll be a setting in both the indicator and the EA, representing the period to use for the trend.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Did anyone get a euro long today at 1.10744?

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Yep.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Yep mine triggered a long but not looking good, hoping US news swings this one around.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Does your robot stop working automatically? It happened a few times. During work, the robot stops working on its own. The smile on the chart disappears. the robot disappears. I checked it on several platforms. It disappears after the transaction. Does not set SL or TP. Picture attached. There is a problem with the new version. All older ones work without interruption.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Very weird - I'll take a look. So, 1.4 doesn't do this, but 1.41 does?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Yes. This is version 1.41 the problem has been occurring since the beginning of my tests. Not always rather sporadically). But after that you have to complete the transaction manually (no SL and TP). And turn on the robot again.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
V1.41 is working correctly for me on EU...two buys today, first one in red so far -27 pips, second one buy at 1.10373 and already closed for 10 pips !

--- 帖子 #675 ---
another problem occurred. It appeared to me a second time. Everything was good. just now received the information: "no - market is closet" the logbook is silent.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I've checked the code between the two versions, and the only changes made for 1.41 was to do with the information panel, nothing else, so I can't understand why you are getting this issue with 1.41 and not 1.4. Looking at your logs, the EA is unloading itself due to not being able to update the SL and TP on the trade. This 'feature' has been in my code since the first version, which is why I don't understand why it's suddenly occurring. The error shown means that the SL or TP is no longer valid, meaning that in between the time of placing the order and then applying the calculated SL and TP, the price has moved sufficiently for the SP and/or TP to no longer be valid. This can happen during times of high volatility. Alternatively, it is also possible that your broker has changed the minimum number of points between the current price and the SL on the fly - many brokers do this throughout the day as volatility and/or liquidity changes. Gold is a particularly fast moving instrument, which might explain why you're experiencing this on gold and not EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
This is purely for informational purposes only and doesn't affect the opening of orders. This is based on the information supplied by the broker, and varies by instrument. Sometimes, the info supplied by the broker is not correct, so it appears to the EA that the market is closed for that instrument when it actually isn't, which is why I haven't restricted trading due to this information. If the market is truly closed when the EA tries to open an order, the open will fail with the appropriate error.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
OK I understand. Can you somehow solve this problem? I have also noticed a problem with these currency pairs; usd/chf , usd/jpy , gpb/jpy , nzd/usd

--- 帖子 #679 ---
If the SL and TP cannot be set for some reason, what would you like to happen?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Good question. Bigger SL / TP? Slippage has something to do with this? Set more slippage? At the same time, I'm still testing this version; https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post12651037 has been running fine for two weeks. It opens transactions differently. But it works fine. This problem does not occur. now it's the same with gbp / usd (an hour ago). Is this the same problem?

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Slippage is a different issue, and the errors you displayed had nothing to do with that. The reason that the version you linked to works is because it is opening the orders with the SL and TP already set. This is not permitted when using a true ECN broker, hence why my (and other) EAs always open an order without any SL or TP, and then immediately set them afterwards. The logs you supplied don't show the same issue. They show that you are setting an SL ok, but seem to have omitted any TP - presumably you have it set to zero in your settings?

--- 帖子 #682 ---
No. In each case SL and TP is set (Not at zero). Both cases exclude the robot from the chart.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
There don't seem to be any errors shown in your screen print, nor are there messages saying that the EA have been unloaded from the chart. Do you have any logs showing this? Which broker are you using?

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi Paul, will youupdate the EA with it? seems pretty good!

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Yes it's true. There is no information in the log. That's weird. The robot just disappears. Robots work in; AxiTrader IC Markets Orbex Do you know any broker with low spread? I will put in additional settings. Now I have 3 computers that are working all the time. This is how it tests

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Yes, I'm currently working through an issue, namely that every now and then the EA opens order when the indicator doesn't show a signal. Once I have that sorted it should be ready for me to upload.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
i detect many fail is any boady test it for at least 3 month?

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Test what, exactly?

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Well my EURUSD orders took a massive hit today that was painful to see.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Mine is still running, but it's not looking good, I'll admit. EDIT: It's gone

--- 帖子 #692 ---
I'm using just IC Markets.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Late to the thread here, it's an interesting method. I have been looking for a scalp method for sometime off an H1 or similar time-frame and this looks fascinating. Nice you've been writting an EA for it PaulDV, I think it will be a difficult thing to do as there's one of two unspecific things in the rules like: 'significantly greater' and 'leave it for a few bars and it'll most likely come back to hit the TP'. It's my belief it's these little nuances that can keep this method profitable! I'm going to try and forward test Currency Grail on a few pairs. Many thanks for keeping the thread going guys

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I use ICM too PaulDV, their spreads are very good, albeit A$7.00 commission! I see you're from good old blighty, me too !!

--- 帖子 #695 ---
One thing I forgot, a Script would be great to enter trade quickly with TP all set, does anyone possess such a thing or know where I can download one from?

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Last past 2-3 days in loosing trades on eurusd all profit gone

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Are you using EA Rilix?

--- 帖子 #698 ---
yes and its loosing now

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Out of interest, Rilix, what settings are you using for EURUSD?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
its +/- default seetings

--- 帖子 #701 ---
That seems a bit odd, as I'm running the default settings, and only had the one losing trade on EURUSD (opened on 03/03/2020 at 10:00).

--- 帖子 #702 ---
I use Complete Order Entry: https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/10332 This version is free, but it's so good that I paid the small fee for the paid version to show my support.

using 2.9, 1.5, 0.5 first 3 parameters

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Thank you PaulDV You're right it's damn good

--- 帖子 #705 ---
LoL, I liked the idea of this order management tool and downloaded the free version - total freeze meta4 - nothing worked - had to uninstall platform. Probably isn't compatible with some other programs I run - will try again. .

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Same here on a Demo account with IC Markets , the days this week resulted in losses. I also see the Buy trades incurred more losses than the Sell ones.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Question should be, what TF you are using? I would guess M1.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
for m1 the results are promising. I have several settings (not basic) and they work fine. For original settings, preferably h1 edit; I have pasted results for EUR / USD. A few days, all transactions. For 3 days I have been testing "trailing stop" (red frame on the right)

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Check out Admiral Markets, they have low spread and most importantly they don't charge commisions (check their different account types though). Currently the spread for EUR/USD is 0,6 and no commision.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Awesome!!!!

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Another two weeks of testing. Then a live account. I will choose the best settings. Now it's "fun" to check the performance. It will be amazing when Paul releases a new version (with a trend filter). Already impatient Thank you. I'll check it out tonight. I take a break from the stock market on weekends. So I'll be back to this next week.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
You can opt to use their 'Standard' account which has no commission but higher spreads . Personally, I'll take lower spreads + commission any day because when it comes to scalping, it's the number of wins that matter the most.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Yep, lower spreads are best! I notice that the author's website has disappeared, wonder why? He metioned using this method on the daily although he doesn't elaborate on that time-frame. There's a problem with daily of course because of the time of entry, spreads go nuts at rollover time, does anyone have a way to get over that? Many thanks for your effort PaulDV, do you write the code direct or do you employ something like EA Builder?

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Been testing this method a lot, in my observation it works very well on the large movers such as GJ and GA etc, less so on EU etc, but nonetheless still ok! I do see where the author's coming from on using it with no Stop Losses, because price does have a tendency to come back to hit the TP after a few bars of going against you. Whether I coud trade with no SL on a live account is another matter..... But this is a great method and something I could never have come up with myself. I'm going to forward test this over the next few weeks on a demo, trading manually over a few pairs. Also interesting how an EA would shape up over a similar time, I'm not a coder so hats of to PaulDV for writing ane on this Spread's something you have to be careful of but doesn't seem to be a problem with ICM

--- 帖子 #715 ---
The PDF is from 2014, and nothing much stays around for long in the forex world, so it's of no surprise to me that the website no longer exists, but it was originally based in New Zealand, judging from the domain suffix. The thing I find most odd is that the author didn't put his name to the document, so I believe that any copyright is completely unenforceable should he decide to lay claim to it... On the Daily, according to the rules, you're going for 50 pips profit, so spread shouldn't really be such an issue. In fact you would probably do better with a 'standard' (i.e. non-commission) account. I write the code myself - I've never heard of EA Builder - but now I'm going to go look!

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Yeah, I'm not sure I'd be confident enough to trade this without a stop. I'm giving it a go on demo, but it's not looking good. I think that trading this manually may actually yield better results that using the EA. Certainly, with the EA I have not been able to find any decent settings on the H1 timeframe for any other currency pair.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Paul said something important. My results are from the broker "orbex" I compared it with ic markets. Doesn't coincide. Entrances are in other places. so the results are worse. Before anyone wants to enter data, check the demo because you can lose money.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I don't think it'll matter too much over-time. Not heard of Orbex although I see it's Cypiate, not sure if they're ECN or a Market Maker that could account for the difference as ICM are ECN

--- 帖子 #719 ---
is very important. the robot and indicator is based on candle lengths. Each broker has different indications. candle length. wicks. the price is different. levels of support and resistance broken. I have an account in ic markets. my fiancee has. and my brother. The difference is only the server. And each of us has different price indications in some cases.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I was meaning that, over a period of time, it won't make a lot of difference to the results, because the differences will even out!

--- 帖子 #721 ---
this is not excluded. My tests will take longer. I check simultaneously on admiral markets. and on ic markets .

--- 帖子 #722 ---
I have to agree with BeFree: the effectiveness of any of the settings for the EAs in this thread (not just mine) are very broker-specific. BeFree and I ran the same settings on two different brokers and got wildly different result - terrible ones in my case (ICMarkets). The issue is that the candles can be extremely different between brokers, and as we're using candle to candle comparison, the results are going to vary. I had hoped that those variances wouldn't be significant, but it turns out that they are very much so.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
t's true. The trend filter should solve the problem. Even during different results from different brokers. The only obstacle during m1 will be consolidation. But then I will also test a higher time frame. It can also be helpful in other currencies. Currently, all currency pairs I check have bad results. usd / gbp and eur / gbp have very bad results. So far 1 profitable day. the rest all the time loss. Other currencies also.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
I hear what you're saying. My opinion comes from my many years of trading, where I trade based on probabilities where bars close and open at slightly differing times and have different highs &amp; lows between brokers due to server times etc. But over-time (about a few months) these differences tend to get evened out! BTW demo servers are notoriously bad on time, my ICM demo server constantly drops out and quite often has different highs and lows on bars compared to my live account!!

--- 帖子 #725 ---
The problem is not only about the demo account. I think I have already written about it but will write again. I have an account in ic markets. (Live) My fiancee also has an account. (Live) My brother also has an account. (Live) Each of us has on a different server. And there are candles. Price levels that vary. We all have in ic markets. The difference is only in the servers. But there are still differences in the price achieved. and in the appearance of candles.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Yes well I guess there's always going to be differences between different brokers and their servers, so I would suggest just sticking to one and trade just that! All these different times and broker nuances just re-enforces my belief that technical analysis of charts is a waste of time and not what the professionals do! But that's a whole different subject and way off this thread.......... Anyway, I do believe that this scalping method has merit, I just have to find the right way to execute it

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Looks like I'm not the only one with wonky charts. Funny thing is I still make money from them.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Trouble is sponge, you don't notice they're wonky until someone else tells you that they're wonky!! So, keep using them............... Forex has no central exchange, so price is open to interpretation by brokers, or can be just indicative ....

--- 帖子 #729 ---
With just the rules from the PDF, it's been pretty good. 1. Check for the prevailing daily trend. 2. Consider setups that align with the daily trend alone on H1 3. Look for a good entry from a suitable lower TF.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Not sure I remember reading those three rules Express, unless I've missed something!

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Actually not in the PDF. Those highlighted above are just additional filters to get on a real good side of the market.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Take for example AUDJPY, daily trend is down. 15:00 and 16:00 candle formed a perfect sell setup on H1 Went to M15 to find a clear sell direction, found one and 10pips already in the bag. Doing a backtest could be tedious, a forward testing can be done to ascertain the potency this inclusion. Thanks

--- 帖子 #733 ---
ok, understand. Only the author does say to not modify, although I do see where you're coming from

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Hi Express!! Good point. I have a question, if you see one setup at 03:00 what do you understand as daily trend? Last 3 hours or last 24h? Thanks

--- 帖子 #735 ---
I guess this system isn't foolproof after all.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
After reading the thread again, perhaps my chart is wrong since it's from a spreadbetting demo account from IG.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
I use my eyes and the little understanding I gained from the use of demand and supply zones to guage the daily trend. There are lots of indicators out there to guage closely the prevailing trend on a given TF, check around for a suitable one for you, else you go through the pains for months to learn how to use Demand and Supply Zones to determine the trend accurately in a glance.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Switch to D1 and check if the trend is bullish or bearish. If you're truly convinced that it is bearish, then you shouldn't have considered that trade you circled cos you are will be trading against the prevailing trend.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
What about here? Daily showed a bullish trend.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
This scalping method's all about a quick scalp, and it relies upon a low spread which you can only get from an ECN/STP broker, and as far as I'm aware there are no true ECN brokers in the UK! Spread Bet brokers are Market Makers...... Your example is not a good entry as the second bar opens near the top and the rules say that's not the best. In my testing H4 isn't the best time-frame, H1 works much better for a quick 5 pips. Lately EU's been trending so it's not performing well, GJ's much better albeit its spread has to be watched, but it's not bad on IC Markets being around 0.4 ish. Plus I do think that the bigger daily movers work much better, such as GJ, GA etc

--- 帖子 #741 ---
That trade would have won.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
From my testing on the H1 time-frame this method works well, particularly on the larger daily range pairs. As the author said the best way to trade this is without a stop, and if you study the price bars you can see why! But, is trading without an SL a step too far! The delema is, if you put it too close you'll get stopped out often (where price would've come back to hit your TP), or you put it further out risking being stopped out negating any profit made......... but trading is all about making decisions!

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I dont use the D1 for candle formation, just for trend direction.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Thank you guys for your replies. So, first thing to do is to choose an ECN broker. IC Markets it is!

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Today, for example, I spotted a buy candle formation with USDJPY on H1. No doubt, the trend has been bullish since September 2019. Went to a lower TF and got a suitable price to buy at 109.80. Waiting to hit between 5-10pips and I'm out.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hi Express, I'm not sure I understand how you're using this method, why do you go to a lower time-frame to enter? And UJ only travels around 44 pips a day currently, so getting a quick 5/10 pip scalp on that pair is not going to be easy. How are you measuring the trend, granted it's been slightly upwards on the daily but it's pretty much in a sideways pattern! But surely the daily trend doesn't have any bearing at all on an H1 five to ten pip scalp, and also the author of the Currency Grail method does say to ignor anything but the two bars you're looking at. Sorry to be so negative but I'm just trying to get a handle on how you're trading this method

--- 帖子 #747 ---
1. I look into the lower time frame to get into the trend as quick as possible after a slight retracement that usually follow the candle formation from the H1 in the pdf. 2. How would 10pips out of 44pips be difficult? I don't seem to understand that part of your question either. 3. Like I said earlier, I use demand and supply zones to gauge the overall daily trend. You have not sounded negative a bit.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Thanks for your reply. I was just thinking that five to ten pips is quite a high percentage of a 44 pip daily range. Because at some point you're going to get into a situation where you'll be holding overnight and getting into a Swap problem, and as the TP is a relatively small size negative swap will, over-time, erode your edge!

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Took some few hours, but TP of 10pips reached.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
How many setups are there on a regular day?

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Average of 3 solid complete candle formations. Its really hard to come by with my other additions though, but when they all form together, u can be sure of high degree TP.

How could the author of the PDF possibly think one can double his capital within a month using this? Weird

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I've been trading this manually for the past couple of weeks and it does work well, especially on H1. But it is quite difficult to trade it on more than two to three pairs manually as entries can happen at the same time, and it's easy to get messed up. I've also had MT4 freeze up a couple of times for a few seconds with entries, which is a bit unnerving! Going to give PaulDV's EA a run now as well, see how it goes! PaulDV your EA seems to expire soon, are you going to do a replacement at all? BTW thank you for your effort on this, as I know EA writting is not easy.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Testing on the M1 chart and it look promising, what do you all say, yes check it out backtest it and tell results

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hi all! To the ones operating manually how do you set stop losses? I ve been trying on h1 and I put 5pips of TP and 17pips of SL but my RR has me wondering if it's to much risky. My win rate is around 75% in one month. If someone bring me some light I will appreciate it

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Thanks for your reply can you give me some recommendation?

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Has this EA been tested on real account? Do you get benefits only in demo?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Manually I'm not using a stop, as the author describs. Would I able to do this on a live account? I'm not sure! But if you're using a stop you could try to place it where the author suggests, but it is a dilemma. Too close and you'll be stopped more often, too far away and one stop-out will negate all your profits for many days. There is no best way.............. On the whole though, if it does go the wrong way against you it usually does come back after a few bars as the author describs. Like all trading it's not easy. With this method the trend is not your friend.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Yes, it's true that the author doesn't use it. But using the method without stops i have burnt 2 demo accounts. How long have you been trying it?

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Only a few weeks One thing I would say is that I think it works best on GJ and other high volatile pairs But beware of strong daily trends, although these are fairly rare

--- 帖子 #761 ---
How are you guys trading this successfully? Perfect setups are so rare that you might only make 5 trades a week and that's if you're watching 20 pairs. Anything less than a 'perfect' setup and its a 50/50 win ratio.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
You'd have to ask the EA author PaulDV about that. Not sure what you mean about "benefits in Demo"

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Yes perfect setups are about one or two a day, but a few more on volatile pairs I'm trialing on H1 GJ and GA entering on nearly every bar open during London, results are quite good but it's work in progress

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Please ranger_lp have you made a new daashboard for the latest PAUL EA

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I made a slight change to the standard settings of this EA on the EUR/USD and found that you get quite a bump in performance with a TP of 13, vs no TP. I ran these tests a few weeks ago after our most recent loss, which is why the report doesn't show the two wins since then. These results are from Jan 1, 2013 till now with ORIGINAL settings. The starting amount is 2000 US dollars:

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Here's the same test but with a TP of 13. You'll notice less of a drawn down and much more profit over time. I tested many TP settings but this seemed to be optimal. Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Is it possible to apply this style for candlesticks? Sorry,just asking

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Nice testing thanks. A consideration for programmers might be a dynamic TP based on ATR?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
The EA has expired

--- 帖子 #770 ---
New version with expiry set way in the future. This version has had a few logic bugs ironed out and also contains a trend filter based on the attached TCCI indicator. It doesn't actually work that well, and my advice is NOT to use it. The reason for this is that the TCCI indicator repaints, so there will be discrepancies between the CGS indicator and the CGS EA. When I get time, I will amend the indicator so that it doesn't repaint and will then continue with testing. In the meantime, have fun, and let us know if you find any good settings.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Thanks PaulDV

--- 帖子 #772 ---
hello Paul. Maybe this TCCI will be better. Check him out.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Sorry, my mistake: I meant to say that the CGS Indi repaints - the TCCI is fine - so I end up with the EA taking trades that the indi 'appears' to avoid.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hello All, I have more better way rather than this, and I'm willing to share to all of you.. just hope somebody can do a revise and do some backtest and post the result here.. check the file below..

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Just a note about the rarity of setups - if you relax the standards for the bar pattern and simply trade taller than average bars you'll get more entries and most of them revert just as readily. The caveat is that the 5-8% of trades that don't revert will trend like a roaring jet and can quickly wipe you out if precautions are not taken.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Welcome. Does this mean you are finishing your work on your EA? I start testing today. I see that EA has not changed. the settings are the same. Can I somehow set the indicator condition manually? I mean that I could change it instead of "movin average" 20 enter a different value. A value of 20 often changes the signal. I look at 100 and it seems better. But each time interval needed to adjust the "MA" parameter.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Hiya buddy, Yes, I will be getting back to it, but finding the time is becoming an issue as I've started a new job recently and don't have much downtime right now. Both the EA and the Indicator now have a trend filter period: this is the period to use for the TCCI indicator, and you can switch it off by using zero, or change the period to whatever you wish. The TCCI indicator defaults to a period of 20, which should be about right for the H1 timeframe. For lower timeframes, the period should be smaller - around 16 would probably be OK.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Great Work PaulDV, this journey is no where near the end yet, still unclear what will the final product would be...Forex has never been easy and never will be...

--- 帖子 #779 ---
What does this have to do with the Currency Grail Scalping strategy?

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I'm sorry PaulDV, If this seems not to do with currency grail, but I found that this maybe can be the alternate one.. cause it's seems profitable..and winning rate also high as same as currency grail.. I'm sorry for posting like that.. cause I see this is the thread about currency grail.. so I just want to share with all of you.. and also Im just a junior member.. i can't post a thread..

Hi with setup parameter you use ? My screen look another

Wasn't this a valid setup?

It was a good one. But the system is not perfect and if you go against the trend it will fail even more

Hi Guys Just checking in, I don't seem to have taken a EURUSD trade on this on my demo for a long time, everything looks OK on the EA, I saw a buy signal, but no corresponding trade (I know it may be my demo account / broker) Can anyone confirm the last trade that as taken on this EA for EURUSD please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Was just testing this again and think these might be better for trigger setting (I was just testing the default setting before) Not so good at the start of the year for EU on this. Is the EA expired. Try to reload it and see or ask Paul Attached Image

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Everything is setup and running ok as per his template I've enabled debugging to see if it's doing something I'm not seeing Paul I had 2 arrows / trades appear,but they were never actually executed

--- 帖子 #788 ---
In my humble opinion this method doesn't work that well as an EA, trading it manually is the way forward and, i have to say, without stops!

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hello, there is always something to be learned from your posts.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
I would start with checking the entry parameters between the indicator and the EA - they have to be exactly the same. That said, there is a 'bug' in the indicator which causes it to repaint, whereas the EA doesn't, so it's possible for the EA to enter a trade without there being anything on the indicator, and vice versa. As rover99x has said, I don't think this strategy is suited to an EA.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I do though think this method is a reasonable scalping strategy and works a surprisingly number of times! You have to work quickly though if you're trading it on a few pairs... A method of entering several pairs at once on one click would be useful

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hi all, I like this strategy... (but haven't tried it yet) Has anyone tried this method in combination with a MEME strategy from "Trading Made Simple". That could solve a lot of problems for those rare cases where the price is not going in the preferred direction. It would act as a middle between using no stop-loss and a stop-loss. If you're not familiar with the MEME strategy, just reply here. I am happy to explain the ins and outs. Maybe we can get some life back in this thread. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hi, i am still forward testing it. At some times it has a massive draw down. Most of the times the scalping works (very first hour after going in the market for eurusd) But at some time it massivly fails... I thought about maybe the EA can be changed only to trade one candle after going in... and than going out of the market?

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hi PaulDV! Can this trend filter be added to the indicator? What do you think of using this for binary options? It doesn't look very accurate when I simply add the indicator to a chart on the 15-minute timeframe. What can be done to get it as accurate as in your photo? Thanks very much!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
hello all!if you please can add a function according to which after touching sl, to open in its place automatically another trade in the opposite direction and double the lotsize? for exemple -10 pips in sell trade, hit sl , close trade, and open automaatically a buy position for 5 pips tp with double lot size.

I tested this strategy on US30, and it's showing some good results. DOW is highly volatile, so I decided to test it on a 5M chart, and it's giving a few entries per hour, 5-20pips per trade. One thing that I've noticed is that the second candle is not always significantly bigger than the first. + there are other patterns that I started recognizing because of this strategy which is nicely adding to the number of pips.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Paul I know you said this doesn't work best in an EA, but i was actually using this well on EURUSD, could you remove / amend the expiry on this EA as well please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Wow! I thought this one was long dead! I never did get around to fixing the repainting issue - I tried, but it was looking near impossible, so I kind of lost interest. I'll try and locate the source and dust it off.

Here's version 1.5 but without the expiry date (I've called it Version 1.51). I'd be interested in hearing any promising settings that people have found. Attached File(s) Currency Grail EA.ex4 145 KB | 915 downloads

Thanks, all up and running OK Thank you very much for the fast turnaround.

I've been browsing for a while but just joined FF to say thank you Paul for the EA. I'd also be interested in hearing about settings for this. Thanks

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Hi @PaulDV, just a simple request for you...i actually bought Forex Steam V10 yesterday as I was looking for an EA, and searching the web for optimum settings i stumbled upon your name and works with it some time ago, can you please say a word about that EA, like your back test results, observations, etc? Is it worth my money? Appreciate your response. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #806 ---
In my view it is not worth your money - you will lose all your funds eventually. PM me if you need further details.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Thanks Paul! What EA would you recommend for me? I am new to trading and EAs got my interest, while I am studying trading strategies. PS: I don't how to PM you here.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hi Bro, can i copy your settings with this EA? If that's okay Thanks

--- 帖子 #809 ---
I'm sure they are default settings from what i remember, either way, attached is my template Don't expect trade every week. Its very selective.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Markets are open but im getting a market closed message on the EA, anyone else having an issue? Thanks

--- 帖子 #811 ---
I attached the ea from Paul (currrency grail ea 1.51) onto my chart and turned on automated trading, how come there is no trades at all. Then i run through the strategy test and the report shows zero trades performed. anyone knows why?

Nobody use this ea or this trade strategy?

Hello Paul! It shows ideal results with almost all TFs and settings (attached, rename to .set) but with USDCAD only. I tried to modify it but no changes. Can you/we modify the code? Or maybe you can share your own experience with it? Anyway I thank you for your work!

An interesting way of catching trend pull backs. However not having a stopLoss / exit strategy is simply crazy. I've coded this up in Java on Dukascopy JForex &amp; back-testing looks quite promising on high timeframes once I added a Momentum filter.
