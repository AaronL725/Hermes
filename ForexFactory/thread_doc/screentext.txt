Now in order for the nnclient to know where the buy/sell buttons are
you must select the text box, move your mouse over to the buy button and press
'b'(do not click) move the mouse over to the sell button and press 's'.
Now the nnclient knows where the buy and sell buttons are you can minimize it,
however the order window cannot be moved or minimized.
