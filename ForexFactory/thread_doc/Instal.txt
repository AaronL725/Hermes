1 - You open the M1 chart (most accurate)
2 - You put strategy Renkolive chart (the one you put in the folder expert)
3 - wait until it loads the strategy (to the left, top, right of the smiley)
4 - You open offline chart
Done ... :-)

Use Renkolive, I sent you a test to see should you have a history, and everything as it should be.Renkoboxsize shows you the size of the candle Renko, ie. 
if you put a value of 100, so the candle will have a size of 10 points. I use 30 = 3 points. 
That you can change how you want and what you'll be fine.Importantly, it is the price movement, the time for "rectangle" irrelevant. 
May form 5 seconds, but must be 10 minutes. I hope this is understandable. :-)
