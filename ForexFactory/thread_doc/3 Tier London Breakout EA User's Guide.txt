This EA trades the "3 Tier London Breakout" strategy posted by mer071898 on forexfactory.com
thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=247220

=======================================================================
* Visual help with or without the "3 Tier London Breakout.mq4" indicator:
=======================================================================

This EA can be used along with the "3 Tier London Breakout.mq4" indicator for visual help.
The Indicator will draw the breakout box and TP levels for a given number of days in the past.

The EA can also be configured to draw the breakout box and TP levels by itself, but it will do it only for "today",
and will draw new boxes&levels formed at the beginning of each new session.
However, it will not draw box/levels for the days prior to the time you started the EA.

=======================================================================
!!! IMPORTANT WARNING !!!
=======================================================================

As a security, when running this EA without changing any inputs, this EA is LOCKED and will NOT send any trades.
This is to prevent silly "blindly-load-and-run-and-get-burned" kind of negligent behaviour...
First, you MUST understand how the strategy works, as it is explained in the thread;
Second, you need to read this User's Guide to understand how to setup the EA inputs, and how to unlock it to allow it to trade.
Then it is recommended to use the EA on a Demo account for backtesting and forwardtesting,
in order to get familiar with the use of the EA and its inputs;
Only after these steps, you can start using it on your live account, AT YOUR OWN RISK.


=======================================================================
* EA Input parameters:
=======================================================================

extern bool       SendTrades = false;
	You must set this to true if you want the EA to place trades;
	By default, the EA will NOT send trades, but only show indicator's boxes and fibs (if "ShowBoxes" is true)

extern double     Lot  = 0.01;
	number Lots to use for each open trade;

extern double     MaxRisk = 0;
	Risk management:
	MaxRisk is used only when not using the Martingale options;
	It is the percentage of the account free margin that will be used to compute the size of the open orders
	depending on the stoploss level;
	if MaxRisk is 0, then the size of open orders will be "Lot";

extern int        MagicNumber=0;
	the MagicNumber value to be used when opening orders;
	The EA will open 3 trades at a time, each trade will have a different MagicNumber, as follows:
	magic number for trade #1 = MagicNumber;
	magic number for trade #2 = MagicNumber+1;
	magic number for trade #3 = MagicNumber+2;
	MagicNumbers are used by the EA to handle its trades, 
	so it is important to set this value so that they will not interfere with other EA's trades.
	In particular, you must use DIFFERENT MagicNumber ranges when rnuning this same EA on DIFFERENT PAIRS;
	When "MagicNumber" is 0, the EA will create a unique MagicNumber range for the current chart/pair;
	Running multiple EA on different pairs, all with MagicNumber" set to 0 ensures that all trades will have different MagicNumbers.

extern string     StartTime    = "06:00";
	time for start of breakout box;

extern string     EndTime      = "09:14";
	time for end of breakout box;
	Setting the minutes to ":14" ensures that the "last" 15-minutes bar is being included in the box when rnuning the EA
	on a timeframe lower than M15, which is the timeframe suggested by the startegy.
	By setting the minutes to ":14", you can run the EA on M1 or M5 charts, and still get the same box and levels as if you were
	running it on the M15 chart.

extern string     SessionEndTime= "01:00";
	End of daily session: no new trades will be open after this time;
	However, the EA will continue to take care of trades that were opened before this time, and which are still open;
	They will remain open until they either reach their TP or SL.
	The EA will continue handling the jumping stop on these trades until they close.

extern int        MinBoxSizeInPips = 25;
	minimum tradable box size in pips (not Points);
	when the box is smaller than that value, the EA will NOT send trades during this session;

extern int        MaxBoxSizeInPips = 50;
	maximum tradable box size in pips;
	The EA will either not trade when the box is larger than that value,
	or limit the box size to that value, depending on the "LimitBoxToMaxSize" input below;

extern bool       LimitBoxToMaxSize = true;
	when true, a box larger than MaxBoxSizeInPips will be limited to MaxBoxSizeInPips, 
	and centered on the EMA of the price during the box time range.

extern double     TP1Factor    = 0.618;
	the factor applied to the box size to determine the TP target for Trade #1 (TP1).
	TP1 is the box edge +/- TP1Factor * box_size;
	Example: if the bow size is 32pips, then:
	TP1 for Buy  is box High + TP1Factor * 32pips;
	TP1 for Sell is box Low  - TP1Factor * 32pips;

	Extension to the strategy:
	--------------------------
	TP1Factor can be set to be a FIXED PIP value rather than a factor of the box size;
	When TP1Factor is >=10, it is considered as a FIXED PIPs value to be applied to the box edges;
	Example: with TP1Factor set to 30:
	TP1 for Buy  is box High + 30pips;
	TP1 for Sell is box Low  - 30pips;
	whatever the box size would be;

extern double     TP3Factor    = 2.000;
	this is the TP factor for Trade #3 (TP3);
	The same principles apply as for the TP1Factor input;

Note: trades are sent by bundles of 3 trades, each having a different TP:
	Trade#1 has TP1 target,
	Trade#2 has TP2 target,
	Trade#3 has TP3 target;
	There is NO TP2Factor input;
	TP2 is automatically set to be at half-way between TP1 and TP3;

extern double     SLFactor     = 1.000;
	this is the StopLoss factor for all trades;	
	The same principles apply as for the TP1Factor input, except that it is a stoploss value;

extern double     LevelsResizeFactor = 1.0;
	this factor is applied to all TP/SL factors;
	this can be used to widen or narrow all TP and SL values by the same factor;

extern string     TradeComment="3 Tier London Breakout";


extern int        MaxTradesAllowedPerSession=0;
	Maximum number of 3-trades-series that can be open per session (re-entries);
	A value of 1 means there will be only 3 trades open during this session (1 series of 3 Trades);
	When MaxTradesAllowedPerSession is 0, there is no limit on the number of trades open per session;

extern int        MaxLossesAllowedPerSession=0;
	Maximum number of lost 3-trades-series per session;
	A value of 1 means the EA will not open new trades after 3 lost trades on this session;
	By the nature of the strategy, all 3 trades of series will end either all in profit, or all in loss;
	When MaxTradesAllowedPerSession is 0, there is no limit on the number of losses per session;

extern int        BreakEvenProfitInPips=1;
	number of pips to lock-in when moving the SL to BE;
	Trades #2 & #3 are moved to BE+BreakEvenProfitInPips when TP1 is reached
	(Trade #1 should have reached its TP, unless the spread is high);


extern string     martingale_sequence="0,1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181";
	MARTINGALE multipliers sequence;
	when the first multiplier of the sequence is 0, the Martingale is DISABLED;
	In order to enable the Martingale sequence, you should remove the trailing "0,";
	After a lost series, the size of the next open trades will be determined by the next Martingale multiplier,
	in order to try to recoup the losses;
	The Lot multiplier will continue to increase until the losses are COMPLETELY recouped;
	When the highest multiplier is reached, it is used for all new trades until the losses are COMPLETELY recouped;


extern bool       AutoMartingale=false;
	Auto-martingaling mode:
	When true, the Lot multiplier will be calculated so that the losses are recouped, and will add the current TP,
	instead of picking the multiplier in the sequence;
	This should make the Lot multiplier increase more smoothly, but there is NO LIMIT to the multiplier value,
	which may become VERY HIGH and produce VERY HIGH RISK in the case of a high number of concecutive losses.
	 

extern bool       ResetMartAtFirstProfit=false; // when true, the Mart sequence is reset as soon as profitable trade is reached; else it will scale-in until recouped ALL losses;
	The strategy requires to continue martingaling until ALL losses are recouped;
	even when a series of trades end-up in profit, the pips recouped by this winning series may not recoup all past losses,
	even in AutoMartingale mode;
	This is because the 3 trades are open with the same SL, but different TP values.
	If only TP1 is reached, and TP1Factor is less than SLFactor, then the won pips will not cover a past lost series,
	and we should continue to martingale the next trades;
	When ResetMartAtFirstProfit is true, martingaling will stop at the first profitable series, and the multiplier
	will be reset to 1.
	This limits the increase of the martingale multiplier, therefore limiting the risk,
	but at the cost of possibly not recouping all lost pips.

extern int        Slippage = 3;
	slippage value in pips for each open trade;

extern bool       brokerIsECN=false;
	set this to true when your broker is an ECN, which do not accept to send orders with a SL;
	Orders are open in 2 esparate actions to set to the SL;

**** Settings for autonomously drawing the box and levels, similar to the Indicator's inputs:

extern bool       ShowBoxes    = true;
	set this to true to make the EA draw the boxes and levels just like the Indicator would do;
	this avoids using the indicator AND the EA together;

Colors for box and levels zones:

extern color      BoxColorOK   = LightBlue;
	color of the box when its size is "ok to trade"

extern color      BoxColorNOK  = Red;
	color of the box when its size is "NOT ok to trade"

extern color      BoxColorMAX  = Orange;
	color of the box when its size is greater than MaxBoxSizeInPips and LimitBoxToMaxSize is true;

extern color      LevelColor   = Black;
extern color      SessionColor = Linen; // show Session periods with a different background color
extern int        FibLength    = 12;

extern bool       showProfitZone = true;  // show profit zone in green 
extern color      ProfitColor  = LightGreen; // profit zone color

extern string     objPrefix = "LB2-";  // Prefixes of London Breakout Indicator objects;

extern string     Gap="          ";


Other martingale sequences, in decreasing aggressivity(risk) order:
these "inputs" are not uesd in the EA, but only for informational purpose:
You can can easily copy/paste those martingale sequences to replace the default sequence in set in "martingale_sequence":

extern string     aggressive_fibonacci_sequence="1,2,5,13,34,89,233,610,1597,4181"; // =every second term of fibonacci sequence;
extern string     powers_of_2_sequence="1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096";
extern string     fibonacci_sequence="1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597"; // F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2);
extern string     mild_fibonacci_sequence="1,2,3,4,6,9,13,19,28,41,60,88,129,189,277,406"; // F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-3);
